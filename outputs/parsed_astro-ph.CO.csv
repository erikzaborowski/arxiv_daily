Martinelli",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The Euclid survey aims to trace the evolution of cosmic structures up to redshift $z$ $\sim$ 3 and beyond. Its success depends critically on obtaining highly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all tomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints. However, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases arising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we utilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of $|\Delta\langle z \rangle| = \langle z_{\text{est}} \rangle - \langle z \rangle \leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that defining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift (spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins satisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the photo-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of ten bins [$0 < z\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the realism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey in incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet the requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography defined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used mean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for $\Omega_{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_{8}$, and $\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we perform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift uncertainties. Here, we find that even under an evaluation of the uncertainty where the impact of the redshift bias is substantial, most absolute biases remain below 0.1$\sigma$ in the idealised scenario and below 0.3$\sigma$ in the more realistic case.",
New submissions,Luminous Mid-IR Selected Obscured Quasars at Cosmic Noon in SDSS Stripe82 II: Spectroscopic Diversity and Broad H$α$ Emissions,"Ben Wang,Yuzo Ishikawa,Joseph F. Hennawi,Zheng Cai,Gordon T. Richards,Nadia L. Zakamska,Daming Yang,Jan-Torge Schindler",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a multiwavelength spectroscopic survey of 23 luminous mid-infrared-selected Type-2 quasars at redshifts z = 0.88 to 3.49. The targets were selected in the SDSS Stripe 82 field based on their bright WISE W4 detections (flux > 5 mJy) and extremely faint or red optical counterparts (e.g., r > 23 or r - W4 > 8.4), designed to identify heavily obscured quasars. Deep near-infrared (Gemini/GNIRS) and optical (Keck/LRIS and KCWI) spectroscopy confirm 23 out of 24 candidates as Type-2 quasars in this redshift range, including 12 objects at z > 2. The spectra exhibit strong rest-frame UV and optical emission lines (Ly-alpha, C IV, [O III], H-alpha) with a wide range of line widths, indicating significant spectral diversity. Approximately one-third of the sample (8 of 23) shows broad H-alpha emission (FWHM > 2000 km/s) despite their Type-2 classification, while the rest have only narrow lines (FWHM < 2000 km/s) characteristic of classical obscured quasars. Notably, these broad-line Type-2 quasars share similar spectral energy distributions with the JWST-discovered ""little red dot"" (LRD) AGNs, suggesting that our sample could be lower-redshift analogues of the heavily obscured broad-line AGNs uncovered by JWST. We also find that the [O III] 5007 angstrom emission is relatively weak for their high bolometric luminosities, deviating from trends seen in lower-redshift Type-2 QSOs. A new composite spectrum for Type-2 QSOs is built using our sample. Overall, our results demonstrate that mid-IR selection efficiently uncovers a diverse population of obscured quasars and that spectroscopic follow-up is crucial for revealing their true nature. This study provides new insights into heavily obscured SMBH growth at cosmic noon and bridges the gap to the obscured AGN populations now being revealed by JWST.",
New submissions,Position drift with Gaia,"Andreas Tsigkas Kouvelis,Asta Heinesen,Shashank Shalgar,Mikołaj Korzyński",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The proper motion (also known as position drift) field of extragalactic sources at cosmological distances across our sky can be used to measure the acceleration of the Solar System through the aberration effect. If measured very precisely, the signal would also hold cosmological information, for instance about bulk flows of distant sources or the presence of tensor modes. In the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, the acceleration of the Solar System is by far the dominant contributor to the position drift signal for sources at cosmological distances, and the measurement is therefore expected to yield a constant spheroidal dipole across redshifts as long as convergence to the cosmic restframe has been reached. The aim of this paper is to test this hypothesis. We analyze data from the cosmic reference frame dataset of Gaia data release 3 focusing on constraining the dipole and quadrupole in the position drift signal, with an emphasis on redshift dependence of the signal as a consistency test of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The spheroidal dipole that we find is in mild tension, at the level of $2-3\sigma$, with the constant-in-redshift signature expected from the local acceleration of the Solar System. We also find significant quadrupole components, that however do not have any significant evolution with redshift. The most straightforward interpretation of these findings is (unknown) systematic errors related to the Gaia instrumentation, but a cosmological origin is a possibility. Our analysis remains inconclusive on the cause of the redshift dependence of the dipole and warrants further investigations with upcoming data releases. We discuss possible implications of our results and highlight the importance of proper motion measurements for rest frame determinations in cosmology. In our discussion, we highlight interesting avenues for doing cosmology with Gaia data.",
New submissions,Memoirs of mass accretion: probing the edges of intracluster light in simulated galaxy clusters,"Tara Dacunha,Phil Mansfield,Risa Wechsler",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The diffuse starlight extending throughout massive galaxy clusters, known as intracluster light (ICL), has the potential to be read as a memoir of mass accretion: informative, individual, and yet imperfect. Here, we combine dark matter-only zoom-in simulations from the Symphony suite with the Nimbus ""star-tagging"" model of the stellar halo to assess how much information about the mass assembly of an individual galaxy cluster can be gleaned from idealized measurements of ICL outskirts. We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar profile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar ""splashback"" radii -- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete merger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We find that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time ago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser degree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters that have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time. We use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the MultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive to mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo concentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer of relaxedness, x_off. While our analysis is idealized, the relevant ICL features are potentially detectable in next-generation deep imaging of nearby clusters. This work highlights the promise of ICL measurements and lays the groundwork for more detailed forecasts of their power.",
New submissions,Visualising relativistic effects in redshift space distortions of large scale structure,"Pritha Paul,Chris Clarkson",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Observing large scale structure in redshift space gives rise to the well known redshift space distortions whereby a spherical distribution of galaxies is distorted into an ellipsoid along the line of sight of the observer. This effect is important on linear scales and so can be thought of as a Newtonian correction to the density perturbation even though their physical origin is in the Doppler effect. On larger scales subtler aspects of the Doppler and gravitational redshift effects give rise to further distortions in redshift space. These further contort objects beyond an ellipsoidal compression, into shapes with broken line-of-sight symmetry such as an egg- or bean-like shapes. In this paper, we aim to qualitatively picture how large over-dense regions, including clusters or superclusters, and under-dense regions, such as voids, undergoing infall or outflow respectively, become distorted in redshift space when higher-order relativistic effects are taken into account. This will contribute when analysing structure in real space such as stacking voids which are no longer radially symmetric when these effects are included.",
New submissions,Human vs. machine -- 1:3. Joint analysis of classical and ML-based summary statistics of the Lyman-$α$ forest,"S. Chang,P. Nayak,M. Walther,D. Gruen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"In order to compress and more easily interpret Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (Ly$\alpha$F) datasets, summary statistics, e.g. the power spectrum, are commonly used. However, such summaries unavoidably lose some information, weakening the constraining power on parameters of interest. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based summary approaches have been proposed as an alternative to human-defined statistical measures. This raises a question: can ML-based summaries contain the full information captured by traditional statistics, and vice versa? In this study, we apply three human-defined techniques and one ML-based approach to summarize mock Ly$\alpha$F data from hydrodynamical simulations and infer two thermal parameters of the intergalactic medium, assuming a power-law temperature-density relation. We introduce a metric for measuring the improvement in the figure of merit when combining two summaries. Consequently, we demonstrate that the ML-based summary approach not only contains almost all of the information from the human-defined statistics, but also that it provides significantly stronger constraints by a ratio of better than 1:3 in terms of the posterior volume on the temperature-density relation parameters.",
New submissions,High Frequency Peak Radio Sources from the AT20G Catalogue and Their Radio Spectra,"Elena Majorova,Olga Zhelenkova",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"A sample of high-frequency peaker (HFP) candidates was formed from the AT20G catalog radio sources with spectral indices of the optically thick emission region $\alpha_{below}$ exceeding +0.5. A study of the spectral properties of the sources in the sample, which included 269 radio sources, was performed. The spectra of the sources were constructed and the spectral indices below $\alpha_{below}$ and above the peak $\alpha_{above}$, the peak frequency $\nu_{obs}$, the flux density at the peak frequency $S_{peak}$, and the peak half-width in the radio spectrum were determined. Analysis of the spectra showed that the sample is fairly homogeneous and consists of HFPs with $\nu_{obs}>5$ GHz. Most sources (67%) do not have data at frequencies below 0.8 GHz. 187 sources have ultra-inverted spectra ($\alpha_{below}>$+0.7), which is 3.2% of all sources in the AT20G catalog and 70% of radio sources in our sample. Optical identification of radio sources in the sample showed that 70% of the hosts are quasars. The sample consists of compact objects with radio luminosity at 20 GHz in the range of $10^{23}$-$10^{30}$ W/Hz, angular sizes of emitting regions of radio sources are 0.002-0.25 mas, projected linear sizes are from 0.2 to 30 pc. The dependence of the peak frequencies of radio sources on their angular sizes is in good agreement with that previously discovered for CSS and GPS sources.",
New submissions,X-ray Halos of Early-Type Galaxies with AGN Feedback and Accretion from a Circumgalactic Medium: models and observations,"Silvia Pellegrini(1),Luca Ciotti(1),Zhaoming Gan(2),Dong-Woo Kim(3),Jeremiah P. Ostriker(4) ((1) Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Bologna University, Italy, (2) New Mexico Consortium, Los Alamos, NM, USA, (3) Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA, USA, (4) Dept. of Astronomy, Columbia University, NY, USA)",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The knowledge of the X-ray properties of the hot gas halos of early-type galaxies has significantly advanced in the past years, for large and homogeneously investigated samples. We compare these results with the X-ray properties of an exploratory set of gas evolution models in realistic early-type galaxies, produced with our high-resolution 2D hydrodynamical code MACER that includes AGN feedback and accretion from a circumgalactic medium. The model X-ray emission and absorption are integrated along the line of sight, to obtain maps of the surface brightness Sigma_X and temperature Tx. The X-ray diagnostics considered are the luminosity and average temperature for the whole galaxy (Lx and <Tx>) and within 5 optical effective radii (Lx5 and <Tx5>), and the circularized profiles Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R). The values for Lx, Lx5, <Tx>, and <Tx5> compare very well with those observed. The Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) also present qualitative similarities with those of the representative galaxy NGC5129, and of ETGs with the most commonly observed shape for Tx(R): Sigma_X(R) matches the observed profile over many optical effective radii Re, and Tx(R) reproduces the characteristic bump that peaks at R=(1 - 3)Re. Inside the peak position, Tx(R) declines towards the center, but the explored models are systematically hotter by ~30%; possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. Interestingly, Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) as large as observed outside of R~Re are reproduced only with significant accretion from a circumgalactic medium, highlighting its importance.",
New submissions,Renzo's rule revisited: A statistical study of galaxies' baryon - dark matter coupling,"Enoch Ko(1, 2 and 3),Tariq Yasin(1),Harry Desmond(4),Richard Stiskalek(1),Matt J. Jarvis(1 and 5) ((1) Astrophysics, University of Oxford, (2) DAMTP, University of Cambridge, (3) Department of Physics, University of Warwick, (4) Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation, University of Portsmouth, (5) Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of the Western Cape)",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a systematic statistical analysis of an informal astrophysical phenomenon known as Renzo's rule (or Sancisi's law), which states that ""for any feature in a galaxy's luminosity profile, there is a corresponding feature in the rotation curve, and vice versa."" This is often posed as a challenge for the standard LCDM model while supporting alternative theories such as MOND. Indeed, we identify clear features in the dwarf spiral NGC 1560 -- a prime example for Renzo's rule -- and find correlation statistics which support Renzo's rule with a slight preference for MOND over LCDM halo fits. However, a broader analysis on galaxies in the SPARC database reveals an excess of features in rotation curves that lack clear baryonic counterparts, with correlation statistics deviating up to $3\sigma$ on average from that predicted by both MOND and LCDM haloes, challenging the validity of Renzo's rule. Thus we do not find clear evidence for Renzo's rule in present galaxy data overall. We additionally perform mock tests, which show that a definitive test of Renzo's rule is primarily limited by the lack of clearly resolved baryonic features in current galaxy data.",
Cross submissions,Constraints on cosmological parameters and CMB first acoustic peak in conformal Killing gravity,"Salvatore Capozziello,Carlo Alberto Mantica,Luca Guido Molinari,Giuseppe Sarracino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the frame of conformal Killing gravity cosmology, we performed a Bayesian analysis on two different datasets of Baryonic Acoustic oscillations (DESI and SDSS DR16) and on two datasets of SNeIa (Pantheon+ and Union3). The results for H0 and Omega_M in a spatially flat FRW background are consistent with the Lambda-CDM scenario. We obtain a non-negligible negative value for the novel density of dark sector, Omega_D, and its relevance in the evolution of the cosmological observables thus finding quantitatively what its contribution is on real data to match the standard scenario. The results confirm the dynamical character of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter q0 and the present time dark energy equation of state parameter w0: the latter belongs to the quintessence regime. The evaluation of the first acoustic peak of CMB places it extraordinarily near to the best value provided by the Planck collaboration. In this scenario, we can conclude that late time and early time data can be successfully matched under the same standard.",
Cross submissions,Creating a Universe from Nothing as an Alternative to the Cosmological Principle,"Philip D. Mannheim,Daniel A. Norman,Tianye Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the cosmological Robertson-Walker geometry required of the cosmological principle both the Weyl tensor $C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ and the Bach tensor $W^{\mu\nu}=[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}-R_{\lambda\kappa}]C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ vanish. In general, in perturbations around the cosmological background neither of the fluctuating $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ or $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ would vanish. However, it is possible for $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ to vanish even as $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ does not. In this paper we construct an explicit model in which this is the case. The model consists of a tensor gravitational wavefluctuating around a background with a constant negative 3-curvature. The model is exactly solvable and consists purely of geometric quantities with no matter fields at all (i.e., $G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta W^{\mu\nu}=0$, where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor). The model can thus be created out of nothing, with creating a universe from nothing thus being an alternative principle to the cosmological principle. The fluctuating gravitational wave contributes to the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background in a calculable manner, for which we provide a simple analytic way of treating spatial modes that is based on the use of a spatial mode addition theorem. In addition, we provide a treatment of the anisotropy that is based on properties of bandwidth limited functions.",
Cross submissions,Leptophilic dark matter in $U(1)_{L_{i}-L_{j}}$ models: a solution to the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess consistent with cosmological and laboratory observations,"Jordan Koechler,Mattia Di Mauro",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The particle origin of dark matter (DM) remains elusive despite decades of direct, indirect, and collider searches. Several groups have reported a $\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV and a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce the GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that are approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free extensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number, $U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show that these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the observed relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection constraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing. The $L_\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\chi\sim 40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment anomalies, $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection limits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\sim 70-86$ GeV and a DM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and experimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e., approximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also matches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by strong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where $m_\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the few-percent level.",
Cross submissions,QCD corrections to Minimal Dark Matter annihilations,Alessandro Strumia,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"QCD corrections to fermionic Minimal Dark Matter annihilations increase its annihilation cross section (by 2% for a weak doublet, 1.3% for a triplet, 0.5% for a quintuplet) and thereby the the Dark Matter mass required to achieve the observed cosmological relic abundance via thermal freeze-out.",
Cross submissions,New high-frequency gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions,Wen-Yuan Ai,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"First-order phase transitions in the early Universe are a well-motivated source of gravitational waves (GWs). In this Letter, we identify a previously overlooked GW production mechanism: gravitational transition radiation, arising from graviton emission by particles whose mass changes as they pass through expanding bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collisions or sound waves, this mechanism operates at the microscopic scale set by the Lorentz-contracted wall thickness, leading to GW emission at significantly higher frequencies. The resulting spectrum features a distinctive shape with a peak frequency redshifting to $f_{\rm peak}\sim \gamma_w T_0\sim \gamma_w\times 10^{10}\,{\rm Hz}$ where $\gamma_w$ is the Lorentz boost factor of the wall velocity and $T_0$ is the current temperature of the Universe. This mechanism is generic and is expected to operate similarly for domain walls and other relativistic interfaces.",
Cross submissions,Attenuation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino flux by dark matter scatterings,"Ivan Esteban,Alejandro Ibarra",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"A flux of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos is generally expected to be produced by astrophysical sources at cosmological distances and to reach Earth. In this paper, we investigate the impact of neutrino scattering with dark matter (DM) particles in both the intergalactic medium and the Milky Way on the total flux, energy spectrum, and arrival directions of UHE neutrinos. We emphasize the complementarity of neutrino detectors at different latitudes to probe the anisotropy in the flux at Earth due to the attenuation of the neutrino flux in the Milky Way dark matter halo. We also discuss that, with mild astrophysical assumptions, limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section can be placed even if the neutrino sources are unknown. Finally, we explore all this phenomenology with the recent UHE neutrino event KM3230213A, and place the corresponding limits in the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross-section.",
