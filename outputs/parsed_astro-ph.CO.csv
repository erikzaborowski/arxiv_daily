New submissions,Reconciling Fractional Power Potential and EGB Gravity in the light of ACT,"Mehnaz Zahoor,Suhail Khan,Imtiyaz Ahmad Bhat",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent results from the ACT collaboration indicate a higher value for the scalar spectral index, with $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which sets tighter constraints on inflationary models, and these shifts are not in favor of many pre existing scenarios, including the widely studied and accepted standard Starobinsky model. In this paper, we examine the fractional power scalar potential within the framework of Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity, incorporating standard slow roll approximation. The EGB theory, motivated by higher dimensional models, introduces quadratic curvature corrections and a coupling between the scalar field and the Gauss Bonnet term, thereby modifying the cosmological dynamics. The results show good agreement with observational data, placing the predictions within the $1 \sigma$ region of the ACT $r-n_s$ constraint plot. Furthermore, incorporating the running of the scalar spectral index reinforces the models consistency with observational bounds. We also explore the parameter space of the EGB couplings and identify the range of free parameters for which the results of $n_s$ and $r$ values remain within the $1 \sigma$ region of the ACT constraints. Finally, we also investigate the reheating phase, demonstrating that the model not only agrees with ACT data but also satisfies the lower bound on the reheating temperature, thereby ensuring a consistent and viable cosmological scenario.",
New submissions,Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Cool Cores: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Cool Core Cluster Emission,"Philip F. Hopkins,Eliot Quataert,Emily M. Silich,Jack Sayers,Sam B. Ponnada,Isabel S. Sands",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for >Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.",
New submissions,Cosmic homogeneity: the effect of redshift-space distortions and bias and cosmological constraints,"Xiaoyun Shao,Rodrigo Gon√ßalves,Carlos A. P. Bengaly,Gabriela C. Carvalho,Jailson Alcaniz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a novel cosmological analysis based on the angular correlation dimension $D_2$ curve, a cumulative statistic derived from the two-point correlation function. Unlike traditional 3D approaches, angular $D_2$ is inherently less sensitive to nonlinear dynamical distortions, such as the small-scale Finger-of-God (FoG) effect. Using both MultiDark-Patchy and EZmock galaxy catalogs, we assess the scale-dependent impact of redshift-space distortions on $D_2$ and bias measurements. We demonstrate that the systematic errors associated with FoG modeling can be significantly reduced by restricting the analysis to appropriate minimum comoving angular scales of $\sim 1.25^{\circ} $, which corresponds to comoving scales of $\sim 20\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Since the observational estimative of $D_2(\theta)$ is not dependent on a cosmological model we obtain robust estimates of the galaxy bias and place competitive constraints on the physical matter density $\omega_m$. By applying this framework to SDSS DR12 and DR16 Luminous Red Galaxy data, we obtain $\omega_m = 0.142^{+0.014}_{-0.022}$ (1$\sigma$), which agrees with current CMB analyses. Our results highlight the potential of the angular $D_2$ curve as a model-independent and robust tool for cosmological parameter inference.",
New submissions,Quadratic estimators for unwindowed power spectrum of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and its application to $P_{\rm gm}(k)$ estimation,"Taisei Terawaki,Masahiro Takada,Takanori Taniguchi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxy-galaxy weak lensing provides a powerful means of measuring the average matter distribution around lens galaxies -- i.e., the galaxy bias relation. Properly accounting for the spin-2 nature of weak lensing distortions, we develop a quadratic estimator for measuring the $E$- and $B$-mode angular power spectra from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, correcting for survey window effects arising from, for example, survey geometry and bright star masks. The estimator can be implemented efficiently by adopting FFTs on pixelized maps of the lens galaxy distribution and source galaxy ellipticities, under the flat-sky approximation. Using simulated weak lensing fields and halo catalogs in the light-cone ray-tracing simulations, we show that the estimator can recover the underlying $E$-mode power spectrum, $C_{{\rm g}E}(\ell)$, to within a few percent in fractional error, while minimizing the leakage of $E$-mode into the $B$-mode power spectrum, in each multipole bin over the wide range of multipoles (up to $\ell \sim 3000$ studied in this paper). We then discuss that the estimator can be used to estimate the 3D galaxy-matter power spectrum, $P_{\rm gm}(k)$, by dividing lens galaxies into multiple redshift slices. We also derive an optimal weighting for each lens redshift slice in the shot noise-limited regime for the estimation of $P_{\rm gm}(k)$, which reduces the statistical errors by up to $\sim$20\% compared to the case without weighting.",
New submissions,Refined Constraints on the Hubble Constant from Localized FRBs with Assessment of Systematic Effects,"Chenyuan Xu,Yi Feng,Jiaying Xu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The dispersion measure-redshift relation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides a valuable cosmological probe for constraining the Hubble constant, offering an independent measurement that could help resolve the ongoing Hubble tension. In this paper, we begin with a sample of 117 localized FRBs and use 95 of them to constrain $H_0$ to $71.28^{+1.90}_{-2.08}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ within the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The resulting statistical uncertainty is below 2.8\%, improving previous FRB-based measurements and highlighting the promise of larger future samples. Beyond statistical improvements, we note that different parameter choices have been adopted in previous studies and some results show discrepancies in $H_0$. To address this issue, we perform a systematic assessment of modeling uncertainties that can affect the inferred value of $H_0$, including Galactic electron density models, the contribution of the Galactic halo, outliers such as FRB~20190520B located in extreme environments, and the other parameter selections. We also discuss possible approaches to mitigate these sources of uncertainty, emphasizing both the challenges and prospects of using FRBs as reliable cosmological tools.",
New submissions,A New Framework to Detect Multi-Messenger Signals from Bright Sporadic Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background,"Hardik Jitendra Kuralkar,Mohit Raj Sah,Suvodip Mukherjee",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The temporal dependence of the astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background (SGWB) in the hecto-hertz band brings a unique avenue to identify multi-messenger signals to these sources by using coincident detection in both GW and multi-band EM signals. We developed a new analysis pipeline, \textit{Multi-messenger Cross-Correlation} (MC$^2$) that can search for EM counterparts to the SGWB signal originating from both modeled and unmodeled sources by harnessing the nearly full-sky gamma-ray sky map. We provide an observation strategy that can be followed by current and future missions to discover EM counterparts to the weak GW signal hidden in the SGWB. We demonstrate the ability of this technique to drastically reduce the false alarm rates when involving EM multi-band analysis. This formalism aims towards advancing the multi-messenger observation frontier and improving our understanding of the population of bright SGWB sources present in the high-redshift universe and can also be applied to other messengers such as neutrinos in the future.",
New submissions,Emulating redshift-mixing due to blending in weak gravitational lensing,"Zekang Zhang,Daniel Gruen,Luca Tortorelli,Shun-Sheng Li,Jamie McCullough",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Galaxies whose images overlap in the focal plane of a telescope, commonly referred to as blends, are often located at different redshifts. Blending introduces a challenge to weak lensing cosmology probes, as such blends are subject to shear signals from multiple redshifts. This effect can be described by joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift distribution, $n_{\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes of detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift $z$. In this work, we propose a novel method to correct $n_{\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending by emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. Specifically, we design a ``half-sky-shearing'' simulation with HSC-Wide-like specifications, in which we extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to shear of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the feasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the robustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy population uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the high-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when not modelling the effect. Given appropriately processed image simulations, our correction method can be readily incorporated into future cosmological analyses to mitigate this source of systematic error.",
New submissions,Non-linear Dynamics and Primordial Black Hole Formation During Kination,"Cheng Cheng,Panagiotis Giannadakis,Lucien Heurtier,Eugene A. Lim",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.",
New submissions,A Truncated Primordial Power Spectrum and its Impact on CMB Polarization,"Jingwei Liu,Fulvio Melia",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the impact of a hypothesized delayed initiation of inflation, characterized by a cutoff k_min to the primordial power spectrum in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This cutoff affects both the scalar and tensor spectra, which therefore impacts several measurements of the temperature and polarization distributions. We calculate the angular power spectrum and correlation function with and without k_min in the context of Planck-LCDM, and demonstrate that a non-zero k_min significantly improves the alignment between theory and the observations, including the temperature, E-mode polarization, TE cross-correlation, Q+U polarization and Q-U polarization. It creates an observable signature in both the angular power spectrum and correlation function for all cases. We thus also explore the B-mode polarization, for which current data are not yet precise enough to determine k_min, but whose impact should be detectable with high-precision measurements using future missions, such as LiteBIRD, if the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, is not much smaller than its current upper limit. We find that the introduction of k_min not only addresses large-angle anomalies in the CMB but also provides a more consistent framework for understanding the early Universe's inflationary phase. These findings highlight the importance of future high-precision CMB observations in validating the existence and implications of k_min.",
New submissions,Dark energy constraints in light of theoretical priors,"Neel Shah,Kazuya Koyama,Johannes Noller",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.",
Cross submissions,Primordial black hole formation in matter domination,"Ehsan Ebrahimian,Ali Akbar Abolhasani,Mehrdad Mirbabayi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed by the collapse of rare primordial fluctuations during an early period of Matter Domination. The collapse threshold strongly depends on the shape of the peaks, decreasing as they become flatter and hence rarer. In the extreme limit of a top-hat perturbation, Harada, Kohri, Sasaki, Terada, and Yoo have argued that the growth of velocity dispersion prevents the formation of black holes unless the initial peak is larger than $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{2/5}$. Including the shape distribution of the peaks, we find that for a realistic cosmic abundance of PBHs, the effective threshold is larger, $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms }^{1/10}$. And this model requires $\zeta_{\rm rms}\sim 10^{-1}$, which is much larger than the observed value at the CMB scales. Hence, PBH formation during Matter Domination is barely more efficient than Radiation Domination. We estimate the dimensionless spin parameter to be $a_{\rm rms} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{7/4}\ll 1$, slightly larger than PBHs formed in Radiation Domination.",
Cross submissions,"Non-singular bouncing cosmology in $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity with energy condition violations","A. Zhadyranova,M. Koussour,V. Zhumabekova,N. Zhusupova,S. Muminov,J. Rayimbaev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The singularity and inflationary problems have posed significant challenges for understanding the universe's origin and evolution. Bouncing cosmology has emerged as a promising alternative to standard cosmological models, offering a non-singular approach to early universe dynamics by facilitating a ""bounce"" rather than a singular beginning. In this study, we explore the feasibility of modeling specific bouncing scenarios within the framework of $ f(T, \mathcal{T}) $ gravity, allowing for a comprehensive coupling between the torsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$. We analyze two $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ models: a linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = \alpha T + \beta \mathcal{T}$ and a non-linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = \alpha \sqrt{-T} + \beta \mathcal{T}$, with a parameterized scale factor $a(t) = \sqrt{a_0^2 + \gamma^2 t^2}$ to capture the bounce behavior. The analysis confirms a cosmic bounce at $t = 0 $, where the Hubble parameter $H = 0$ signals a transition from contraction to expansion. A crucial condition for achieving the bounce is the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce, enabling the equation of state (EoS) parameter to enter the phantom region ($\omega < -1$). Both models exhibit an increase in energy density as the universe approaches the bounce, peaking at the bounce epoch and then decreasing post-bounce. Pressure remains negative throughout, with the EoS parameter crossing into the phantom region near the bounce in both positive and negative time zones. Our findings show that NEC and strong energy condition (SEC) violations are essential for the non-singular bounce, while the dominant energy condition (DEC) is satisfied, ensuring a consistent matter distribution...",
Cross submissions,Bayesian Deep Gaussian Processes for Correlated Functional Data: A Case Study in Cosmological Matter Power Spectra,"Stephen A. Walsh,Annie S. Booth,David Higdon,Jared Clark,Kelly R. Moran,Katrin Heitmann",Applications (stat.AP); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Understanding the structure of our universe and the distribution of matter is an area of active research. As cosmological surveys grow in complexity, the development of emulators to efficiently and effectively predict matter power spectra is essential. We are particularly motivated by the Mira-Titan Universe simulation suite that, for a specified cosmological parameterization (termed a ""cosmology""), provides multiple response curves of various fidelities, including correlated functional realizations. Our objective is two-fold. First, we estimate the underlying true matter power spectra, with appropriate uncertainty quantification (UQ), from all of the provided curves. To this end, we propose a novel Bayesian deep Gaussian process (DGP) hierarchical model which synthesizes all the simulation information to estimate the underlying matter power spectra while providing effective UQ. Our model extends previous work on Bayesian DGPs from scalar responses to correlated functional outputs. Second, we leverage our predicted power spectra from various cosmologies in order to accurately predict the entire matter power spectra for an unobserved cosmology. For this task, we use basis function representations of the functional spectra to train a separate Gaussian process emulator. Our method performs well in synthetic exercises and against the benchmark cosmological emulator (Cosmic Emu).",
Cross submissions,Return of the Lepton Number: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production and the Revival of the Shi-Fuller Mechanism,"Cannon M. Vogel,Helena Garc√≠a Escudero,Julien Froustey,Kevork N. Abazajian",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter via the Shi-Fuller (SF) mechanism, revisiting its cosmological viability in light of recent results demonstrating that lepton-number asymmetries $L_\alpha \gtrsim 1$ at temperatures $T > 20\rm\,MeV$ are consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Using a quasi-classical Boltzmann transport calculation of the dark matter production, we compute the non-thermal phase space distributions of sterile neutrinos across a broad range of particle mass $m_s$ and mixing angle $\sin^2{(2\theta)}$ parameter space. We then evolve the resulting distributions through linear structure formation using CLASS and fit the resulting matter power spectra to thermal warm dark matter (WDM) transfer functions, enabling a direct mapping between SF models and equivalent thermal WDM particle masses $m_{\mathrm{th}}$. This allows us to reinterpret existing structure formation limits and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest preferences in the context of SF production. We find that lepton asymmetries $L \gtrsim 0.5$ at high temperatures open significant viable parameter space in the $m_s \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $\sin^2 (2\theta) \lesssim 10^{-14}$ regime, compatible with both X-ray constraints from NuSTAR and INTEGRAL/SPI and recent Lyman-$\alpha$ inferences of $m_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.1\,\mathrm{keV}$. Following lepton number evolution below 20 MeV, we also specifically show that this lepton asymmetry parameter space is compatible with BBN and cosmic microwave background constraints. We present updated constraints, a refined $m_{\mathrm{th}}$ fitting function, and power-law approximations for $L$ across the parameter space. Our results motivate future X-ray observations targeting the $\sim 20$ keV photon regime and testing of the $m_\mathrm{th} \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ WDM region.",
