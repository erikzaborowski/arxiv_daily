New submissions,Needlets and foreground removal for SKAO hydrogen intensity maps,"Bianca De Caro,Isabella P. Carucci,Stefano Camera,Mathieu Remazeilles,Carmelita Carbone",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Intensity Mapping (IM) of the 21-cm line of the neutral hydrogen (\textsc{Hi}) has become a compelling new technique to map the large-scale structure of the Universe. One of the main challenges is the presence of strong foreground emissions of several orders of magnitude larger than the \textsc{Hi}~signal. Here, we implement a version of the Principal Component Analysis, a blind component-separation technique, based on a kind of spherical wavelets called needlets. These functions exploit double localization both in real and in harmonic space. We test Need-PCA performances on a set of maps that simulates the SKA MID radio telescope in the AA4 configuration. We compare our results with other component separation methods such as Generalised Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA) and Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC). All the methods have comparable results, recovering the \textsc{Hi}~signal within 10\% accuracy across the frequency channels, in the multipole range 30 $\lesssim \ell \lesssim$ 136. We also test our pipeline in the presence of systematics such as polarization leakage. We find that the cleaning methods are insensitive to the presence of such systematic, yielding the same results as in the leakage-free case.",
New submissions,Detecting the hidden population of low-mass haloes in strong lenses,Conor M. O'Riordan,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"A generic prediction of particle dark matter theories is that a large population of dark matter substructures should reside inside the host haloes of galaxies. In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are used to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large enough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass haloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect on the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark matter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per cent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations. We propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its parameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects two orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual objects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the population is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available constraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our experiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in the lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are strongly degenerate with the population signal, to an even greater extent than with individual subhaloes. This further highlights the need for better understanding of the angular mass structure of lens galaxies, so that the maximum information can be extracted from strong lens observations for dark matter inference.",
New submissions,No Luminous Little Red Dots: A Sharp Cutoff in Their Luminosity Function,"Yilun Ma,Jenny E. Greene,Marta Volonteri,Andy D. Goulding,David J. Setton,Marianna Annunziatella,Eiichi Egami,Xiaohui Fan,Vasily Kokorev,Ivo Labbe,Xiaojing Lin,Danilo Marchesini,Jorryt Matthee,Themiya Nanayakkara,Luke Robbins,Anna Sajina,Marcin Sawicki",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"One of the most surprising results of early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line objects dubbed ""little red dots"" (LRDs) at $z>4$. Their spatial density ($\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity function (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black hole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L_\mathrm{bol}\gtrsim 10^{45-46}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright end of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able to be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest LRDs ($K<23.7$) at $4.5<z<4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys from the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky coverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at $z_\mathrm{phot}\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of $n(M_{5100}<-23.5)\approx10^{-8}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10 times less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity. When combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift range, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $\lambda L_{5100}\approx2.5\times10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover occurs at $\gtrsim20$ times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the exclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter parts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the luminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black holes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates.",
New submissions,Little Red Dots Are Nurseries of Massive Black Holes,"Fabio Pacucci,Lars Hernquist,Michiko Fujii",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at $z \sim 5$, known as ""Little Red Dots"" (LRDs). With effective radii of $\sim 100$ pc and stellar masses of $10^9-10^{11} \, \rm M_\odot$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, $\rho_\star\sim10^4-10^5 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$ and in some cases up to $\sim 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \, \rm M_\odot$ stars in the central $0.1$ pc is $< 0.1$ Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass $9\times10^3 < M_{\rm VMS} \, [\rm M_\odot] < 5\times10^4$ within $<1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a $\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\bullet \sim 10^4 \, \rm M_\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.",
New submissions,ZTF SN Ia DR2 follow-up: Exploring the origin of the Type Ia supernova host galaxy step through Si II velocities,"U. Burgaz,K. Maguire,L. Galbany,M. Rigault,Y.-L. Kim,J. Sollerman,T. E. Müller-Bravo,M. Ginolin,M. Smith,G. Dimitriadis,J. Johansson,A. Goobar,J. Nordin,P. E. Nugent,J. H. Terwel,A. Townsend,R. Dekany,M. J. Graham,S. L. Groom,N. Rehemtulla,A. Wold",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The relationship between Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their host galaxy stellar masses is well documented. In particular, Hubble residuals display a luminosity shift based on host mass, known as the mass step, which is often used as an extra correction in the standardisation of SN Ia luminosities. Here we investigate Hubble residuals and the mass step in the context of Si II $\lambda 6355$ velocities, using 277 near-peak SNe Ia from ZTF DR2. We divide the sample into high-velocity (HV) and normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia, separated at 12,000 km/s, resulting in 70 HV and 207 NV objects. We then examine links between Si II $\lambda$6355 velocities, light-curve stretch $x_{1}$, colour $c$, and host properties to explore potential environmental and/or progenitor-related effects. Although we only find a marginal difference between the Hubble residuals of HV and NV SNe Ia, the NV mass step is $0.149 \pm 0.024$ mag ($6.3\sigma$), while HV SNe Ia show $0.046 \pm 0.041$ mag ($1.1\sigma$), consistent with zero. The NV-HV mass-step difference is $\sim 2.2\sigma$. The clearest subtype difference is seen in central regions ($d_{DLR} < 1$), where NV SNe Ia show a strong mass step but HV SNe Ia none, yielding a $3.1-3.6\sigma$ difference. A host-colour step appears for both: NV $0.142 \pm 0.024$ mag ($5.9\sigma$) and HV $0.158 \pm 0.042$ mag ($3.8\sigma$). Overall, NV and HV colour steps are consistent. HV SNe Ia show modest ($\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$) steps in outer regions ($d_{DLR} > 1$), while NV SNe show stronger environmental trends. Thus, NV SNe Ia appear more environmentally sensitive, especially in central, likely metal-rich and older regions, while HV SNe Ia show weaker, subset-dependent trends, and applying a universal mass-step correction could introduce biases. Refined classifications or environment-dependent factors may improve future cosmological analyses beyond standard $x_{1}$ and $c$ cuts.",
New submissions,The oldest Milky Way stars: New constraints on the age of the Universe and the Hubble constant,"Elena Tomasetti,Cristina Chiappini,Samir Nepal,Michele Moresco,Carmela Lardo,Andrea Cimatti,Friedrich Anders,Anna B. A. Queiroz,Guilherme Limberg",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We exploit the most robust, old, and cosmology-independent age estimates of individual stars from Gaia DR3 to place a lower bound on the age of the Universe, $t_U$. These constraints can serve as an anchor point for any cosmological model, providing an upper limit to the Hubble constant $H_0$. We consider the stellar age catalog ofarXiv:2402.00561, selecting 3,000 of the oldest and most robustly measured main sequence turn-off (MSTO) and subgiant branch (SGB) stars, with ages $>12.5$ Gyr and associated error $<1$ Gyr. Ages are derived via isochrone fitting using the Bayesian code StarHorse, spanning the uniform range 0-20 Gyr, not assuming any cosmological prior on $t_U$. With a conservative cut in the Kiel diagram, strict quality cuts both on stellar parameters and posterior shapes, and removing potential contaminants, we isolate a final sample of 160 bona-fide stars, representing the largest sample of precise and reliable MSTO and SGB stars ages available to date. The age distribution of the final sample peaks at $13.6 \pm 1.0$ (stat) $\pm 1.3$ (syst) Gyr. Assuming a maximum formation redshift for these stars of $z_f = 20$ (a formation delay of $\sim$0.2 Gyr), we obtain a lower bound on $t_U$ of $t_U \geq 13.8 \pm 1.0$ (stat) $\pm 1.3$ (syst) Gyr. Considering the $10^{th}$ percentile of each star's posterior distributions, we find that, at 90% CL (stat), 70 stars favour $t_U > 13$ Gyr, while none exceeds 14.1 Gyr. An oldest age younger than 13 Gyr for this sample is incompatible with the data, even considering the full systematic error budget. This work presents the first statistically significant use of individual stellar ages as cosmic clocks, opening a new, independent approach for cosmological studies. While this already represents a major step forward, future Gaia data releases will yield even larger and more precise stellar samples, further strengthening these constraints.",
New submissions,Primordial Physics in the Nonlinear Universe: mapping cosmological collider models to weak-lensing observables,"Dhayaa Anbajagane,Hayden Lee",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) are features in the initial density field that provide a window into the nonlinear dynamics of particles during the inflationary epoch. Among them, a distinctive set of signatures from ""cosmological collider physics"" originates through interactions of the inflaton with heavy particles active at high energies. The amplitude and form of these signatures depend on the strength and nature of the interactions. The corresponding features in large-scale structure have been studied predominantly through the use of perturbation theory, restricted to the linear regime of the density field. In this work, we implement a method for running cosmological simulations with arbitrary bispectra signals in their initial density field, and produce a simulation suite of over thirty PNG-generating templates, resolving the corresponding collider signatures in the strongly nonlinear regime of the density field. We detail the signals in a variety of late-time measurements -- the matter power spectra, matter bispectra, the halo abundance, and halo bias. We then forecast the potential constraints on the signal amplitudes using weak lensing measurements from the Year-10 dataset of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The second and third moments of the lensing convergence field produce constraints that are competitive and complementary to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

New submissions,Self-similar kinetics for gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation,"A.S. Dmitriev,D.G. Levkov,A.G. Panin,I.I. Tkachev",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.",
New submissions,"Primordial Physics in the Nonlinear Universe: signatures of inflationary resonances, excitations, and scale dependence","Dhayaa Anbajagane,Hayden Lee",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) are imprints in the initial density field sourced by the dynamics of inflation. These dynamics can induce scale dependence, oscillations, and other features in the primordial bispectrum. We analyze a suite of over thirty PNG templates, including those used in the _Planck_ analyses of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and resolve their signatures in the deeply nonlinear regime of the late-time density field. Using simulations, we forecast results from a lensing analysis of the Year-10 data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that lensing achieves sensitivity comparable to the CMB for many models, and even surpasses it for templates whose features peak on smaller scales, $k \gtrsim 0.2 h/{\rm Mpc}$. Many templates generate non-monotonic behaviors in mass and length scales, providing a distinct phenomenology in the resulting late-time structure. We simulate, for the first time, resonant signatures consistently in both the primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. The constraints on their amplitudes $(A_{\rm pk}, f_{\rm NL})$ are essentially independent, as each affects structure formation in distinct ways. Overall, we find that lensing data can provide competitive and complementary constraints on these models, and can deliver leading constraints when the primordial features are predominantly on smaller scales.

New submissions,Hierarchical assembly impedes the inference of stellar mass growth histories for individual galaxies,R. K. Cochrane,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Some massive, quiescent galaxies at z>3 appear to contain considerable numbers of old stars (forming at z>7). Works inferring the star formation histories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that the assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the well-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else indicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these studies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of observation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models like CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller galaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of stars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use the TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy masses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I demonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to significant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e. looking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by over an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing halo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with decreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied to inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter halo mass functions at high redshift.",
New submissions,Updated bounds on ultra-light dark matter from the tiniest galaxies,"Simon May,Neal Dalal,Andrey Kravtsov",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The particle mass of dark matter (DM) was previously constrained using kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies to $m > 3 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This constraint, which excludes the ""fuzzy"" range of ultra-light dark matter from comprising all of the DM, relies on an estimate of the heating rate from fuzzy dark matter (FDM) wave interference using linear perturbation theory. Here, we compare the results of this perturbative calculation to full Schrödinger-Poisson simulations of the evolution of star particles in FDM halos. This comparison confirms theoretical expectations that FDM heating is stronger in fully nonlinear simulations due to the formation of a dense central soliton whose fluctuations enhance gravitational perturbations, and that bounds on the DM particle mass using this perturbative method are indeed conservative. We also show that these bounds are not affected by possible tidal stripping, since for dwarf satellites like Segue 1, the tidal radius is much larger than the observed size of the galaxy. We further show that the constraints on the mass cannot be evaded by invoking DM self-interactions, due to constraints on the self-interaction from large-scale structure. Lastly, we show that if the recently discovered system Ursa Major III/UNIONS I is a galaxy, the observed properties of this object strengthen the lower bound on the DM mass by over an order of magnitude, to $m > 8 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$, at 95% confidence. This constraint could further be strengthened considerably by more precise measurements of the size and velocity dispersion of this and other similar galaxies, and by using full Schrödinger-Poisson simulations.",
New submissions,Observational challenges to holographic and Ricci dark energy paradigms: Insights from ACT DR6 and DESI DR2,"Peng-Ju Wu,Tian-Nuo Li,Guo-Hong Du,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent studies suggest that dark energy may be dynamical rather than being a mere cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In this work, we examine the viability of two physically well-motivated dynamical dark energy models -- holographic dark energy (HDE) and Ricci dark energy (RDE) -- by confronting them with the latest observational data, including ACT cosmic microwave background anisotropies, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESY5 supernovae. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both frameworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of state (EoS) evolves from $w>-1$ at early times to $w<-1$ at late times, while DESI+DESY5 exhibits a distinct preference for quintessence where $w>-1$ across cosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively disfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate disfavor. Our results show that the HDE and RDE models remain excluded by the new data, reinforcing earlier conclusions drawn from previous datasets.",
New submissions,The $R^2$-Higgs inflation: $R^3$ contribution and preheating after ACT and SPT data,Tanmoy Modak,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The $R^2$-Higgs inflation is one of the simplest yet best-fit models consistent with Planck data. The higher spectral index $n_s$ recently reported by the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and Planck, along with baryonic acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), disfavors the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation at approximately $2\sigma$. Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role. We also show that if the nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Higgs field is $\mathcal{O}(10)$, then preheating via the production of Higgs quanta may help explain the reported observations.",
New submissions,The role of peculiar velocity uncertainties in standard siren cosmology,"Chris Blake,Ryan J. Turner",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Local distance indicators such as standard sirens, in combination with spectroscopic redshift measurements of their host galaxies, allow us to estimate the present-day expansion rate of the Universe parameterised by Hubble's constant, H_0. However, these observed redshifts are systematically modified by the effect of galaxy peculiar velocities. Although these velocities may be estimated from the local density field by the process of velocity-field reconstruction, the intrinsic errors and covariance in these estimates contribute to the error in the H_0 determination. In this paper we demonstrate how the impact of peculiar velocities can be propagated into H_0 measurements from local distance indicators with observed redshifts, incorporating the full covariance of the velocity field induced by bulk flows. We apply our methods to cosmological simulations, testing the importance of this effect in the context of future analyses of gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts used as bright sirens. We conclude that H_0 errors may be increased by up to a factor of 2 in comparison with neglecting peculiar velocity covariance, with the highest impacts expected for sources at nearby distances or with small distance errors. Our analytical methods may also be applied to other local distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae.",
New submissions,Influence of supermassive primordial black holes on ultraviolet luminosity of high-redshift galaxies,"Yi-Yang Li,Hai-Long Huang,Yun-Song Piao",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recently James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have observed an excess of luminous galaxies at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 10$). In this work, we investigate whether supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) can explain it by their influence on the ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) of high-redshift galaxies. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we constrain the parameters relevant with SMPBHs against current JWST observational data. The results reveal that SMPBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{6.3\text{-}8.3} M_\odot$, abundances $f_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{-7}\text{-}10^{-5}$, and sub-Eddington ratios $\lambda_E \ll 1$ can effectively enhance the bright end of the UV LF, consistent with JWST observations.",
New submissions,PatchNet: A hierarchical approach for neural field-level inference from Quijote Simulations,"Anirban Bairagi,Benjamin Wandelt",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Information Theory (cs.IT),"\textit{What is the cosmological information content of a cubic Gigaparsec of dark matter? } Extracting cosmological information from the non-linear matter distribution has high potential to tighten parameter constraints in the era of next-generation surveys such as Euclid, DESI, and the Vera Rubin Observatory. Traditional approaches relying on summary statistics like the power spectrum and bispectrum, though analytically tractable, fail to capture the full non-Gaussian and non-linear structure of the density field. Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) provides a powerful alternative by learning directly from forward-modeled simulations. In this work, we apply SBI to the \textit{Quijote} dark matter simulations and introduce a hierarchical method that integrates small-scale information from field sub-volumes or \textit{patches} with large-scale statistics such as power spectrum and bispectrum. This hybrid strategy is efficient both computationally and in terms of the amount of training data required. It overcomes the memory limitations associated with full-field training. We show that our approach enhances Fisher information relative to analytical summaries and matches that of a very different approach (wavelet-based statistics), providing evidence that we are estimating the full information content of the dark matter density field at the resolution of $\sim 7.8~\mathrm{Mpc}/h$.",
New submissions,The slow evolution of dark matter halos from cusp to core naturally produces extended stellar core-like distributions,"Jorge Sanchez Almeida(1 and 2),Angel R.

Several non-CDM models predict that the DM distribution thermalizes over time, transforming initially cuspy halos into cores. This transformation weakens the gravitational potential, allowing the stellar component to expand and form diffuse, core-like structures. Using analytical models and adiabatic invariants, we examine stellar systems with purely tangential, purely radial, and isotropic orbits evolving under a slowly changing potential. Across a wide range of initial and final conditions, we find that stellar cores form relatively easily, though their properties depend sensitively on these conditions. Orbit types preserve their nature during the DM halo expansion: tangential and radial orbits remain so, while isotropic orbits remain nearly isotropic in the central regions. Systems with circular orbits develop stellar cores when the initial stellar density logarithmic slope lies between -0.5 and -1.2, whereas radial systems do not form cores. Isotropic systems behave similarly to tangential ones, producing cores that are isotropic in the center but develop increasing radial anisotropy outward; the anisotropy parameter ""beta"" grows from sim 0.07 at the core radius to sim 0.5 at three core radii. The theoretical and observational literature suggests initial DM profiles with steep slopes and stellar distributions that are shallower and isotropic at the center. Given these conditions, the mechanism predicts stellar cores with radii at least 40 % that of the DM core and inner logarithmic slopes shallower than 0.6.",
New submissions,A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV. Seeding and growing supermassive black holes in dark matter halos,"Yangyao Chen,Houjun Mo,Huiyuan Wang",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.",
New submissions,PTA Frequency Band Individual Gravitational Wave Sources and Dark Energy Detection Based on Cosmological Simulation,"Qing Yang,Gu-yue Zhang,Yi Huang,Xiao Guo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), detectable via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offer a novel avenue to constrain dark energy. Based on cosmological simulations and semi-analytic galaxy formation models, this study explores the detectability of individual nanohertz SMBBH sources using next-generation PTAs and their potential for constraining dark energy under an optimistic scenario considering only the presence of white noise. By constructing light-cone SMBBH populations across hardening timescales ($\tau_H = 0.1/5/10$Gyr) and computing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), we find advanced PTAs can resolve $10^2$--$10^3$ sources with SNR $> 8$ (primarily at $z < 1$ with chirp masses of $10^8$--$10^{10}M_{\odot}$). If electromagnetic counterparts can be identified, optimal configurations ($\sigma_t = 50$ns, $N_p = 1000$, $T_{\text{obs}} = 30$yr with$ \tau_H \leq 5$Gyr) could constrain the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w$ to $\Delta w \sim 0.023$--$0.048$, where the constraints only exhibit weak dependence on $\tau_H$ within $0.1$--$5$Gyr. If only $10\%$ of GW sources have detectable electromagnetic counterparts, constraints weaken to $\Delta w = 0.075$ ($\tau_H = 0.1$Gyr) and $\Delta w = 0.162$ ($\tau_H = 5$Gyr) under the most optimal parameter configuration. What's more, conservative PTAs ($N_p = 500$, $\sigma_t = 100$--$200$ns) with additional $30$-year data accumulation could double resolvable source counts and improve $\Delta w$ precision by $\sim 40\%$.",

We compare $\verb|class_sz|$ halo model calculations of projected-field kSZ cross-correlations with measurements of these signals from the Websky numerical simulations. We cross-correlate halo density maps from Websky with various CMB secondary signals. We first validate our halo model by comparing its predictions for thermal SZ (tSZ) and patchy screening ($\tau$) cross-correlations to measurements of these signals from Websky. We consider three different halo redshift ranges in our comparisons. We also construct our own kSZ, tSZ, and $\tau$ maps to validate the form of the relevant profiles. Following the tSZ and $\tau$ validation, we compare projected-field kSZ calculations between the halo model and the simulations. We use filters constructed for $\textit{Planck}$ and the Simons Observatory (SO) to assess the accuracy of the halo-model kSZ predictions for experiments of differing sensitivity. Overall, we find good agreement, particularly at $\textit{Planck}$ sensitivity. However, we find an $\approx$ 20$\%$ difference between our halo model and the simulations for SO, which significantly exceeds the predicted error bars. We note that our halo model includes only the dominant expected term in the projected-field kSZ signal; the magnitude of the difference between our model and the simulations is consistent with previous predictions for terms arising from other contractions in the theory calculation. These terms will need to be included to obtain unbiased inference from upcoming projected-field kSZ measurements.",

We elucidate the origin of these statements within the string-theoretical swampland programme. The swampland programme is generating a growing body of insights that have yet to be incorporated into cosmological models. Taking a cosmologist's perspective, we highlight the relevance of swampland conjectures to black holes, dark matter, dark energy, and inflation, including their implications for scalar fields such as quintessence and axions. Our goal is to inspire cosmological model builders to examine the compatibility of effective field theories with quantum gravitational UV completions and to address outstanding cosmological tensions such as the Hubble tension. This comprehensive literature review presents clear definitions, cosmological implications, and the current status - including evidence and counterexamples - of the following swampland conjectures: the anti-de Sitter distance conjecture (AdSDC), the completeness conjecture (CC), the cobordism conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture (dSC), the swampland distance conjecture (SDC), the emergence proposal (EP), the Festina Lente Bound (FLB), the finite number of massless fields conjecture (or finite flux vacua conjecture (FFV)), the no global symmetries conjecture, the no non-supersymmetric theories conjecture, the non-negative null energy condition conjecture, the positive Gauss-Bonnet term conjecture, the species scale conjecture, the gravitino swampland conjecture (GSC), the tadpole conjecture, the tameness conjecture, the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (tPCC/TCC), the unique geodesic conjecture, and the weak gravity conjecture (WGC), including the repulsive force conjecture (RFC).",
Cross submissions,Anatomy of Family Trees in Cosmological Correlators,"Bingchu Fan,Zhong-Zhi Xianyu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The time-ordered multilayer integrals have long been cited as major challenges in the analytical study of cosmological correlators and wavefunction coefficients. The recently proposed family tree decomposition technique solved these time integrals in terms of canonical objects called family trees, which are multivariate hypergeometric functions with energies as variables and twists as parameters. In this work, we provide a systematic study of the analytical properties of family trees. By exploiting the great flexibility of Mellin representations of family trees, we identify and characterize all their singularities in both variables and parameters and find their exact series representations around all singularities with finite convergent domains. These series automatically generate analytical continuation of arbitrary family trees over many distinct regions in the energy space. As a corollary, we show the factorization of family trees at zero partial-energy singularities to all orders. Our findings offer essential analytical data for further understanding and computing cosmological correlators.",
Cross submissions,Unitary and Analytic Renormalisation of Cosmological Correlators,"Diksha Jain,Enrico Pajer,Xi Tong",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Loop contributions to cosmological correlators and to the associated wavefunction are of key theoretical and phenomenological interest. Here, we investigate and compare different renormalisation schemes proposed in the literature to handle ultraviolet divergences and develop new schemes adapting $\eta$ regulators to de Sitter spacetime. We focus on one-loop contributions to the quadratic wavefunction coefficient of a shift-symmetric massless scalar in de Sitter spacetime, which is a good toy model of primordial curvature perturbations. We show that different implementations of dimensional regularisation agree with each other and with unitarity and scale invariance in the final renormalised result. Imposing unitarity in the form of the cosmological optical theorem, we define a class of unitary and analytic $\eta$ regulators that agree with dim reg but feature considerable technical and conceptual simplifications. We show that the imaginary part of all one-loop wavefunction coefficients is universally fixed in terms of the logarithmic running of the real part, under the assumptions of scale invariance, Bunch-Davies vacuum and light bulk fields. Our work resolves discrepancies in the literature, establishes regulator-independent predictions for the imaginary part at one loop, and provides a practical framework for computing quantum contributions to cosmological correlators.",

For the first time, we combine the waves produced by the PBH decay, with their density fluctuation counterpart, as well as their effects on the GW produced by the inflaton {\it after} (high frequency modes) and {\it before} (low frequency modes) the end of inflation. We generalize our study for a potential $V(\phi)\propto \phi^k$ during reheating. We also extend our study, taking into account a possible memory burden effect to see how it can affect the shape of the spectrum.",
Cross submissions,"Viability Constraints on Baryogenesis in f (R, Lm, T) Gravity","Kalyan Malakar,Rajdeep Mazumdar,Mrinnoy M Gohain,Kalyan Bhuyan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Our study explores gravitational baryogenesis in the context of f(R, Lm, T) gravity, where R denotes the Ricci scalar, Lm represents the Lagrangian density of the matter field, and T stands for the metric contraction of T_{mu nu}. We focus on a linear model: f(R, Lm, T) = alpha R + beta Lm + gamma T, and examine the parameter constraints for a successful baryon asymmetry generation in four different eras of the cosmos under the assumption of a power-law cosmic expansion. The computed baryon-to-entropy ratio is found to be consistent with the observed order of asymmetry ratio, 9.42 x 10^-11. Furthermore, the study is extended to the generalized framework of gravitational baryogenesis, where the outcome shows strong agreement with the current observational data. Our findings indicate that the f(R, Lm, T) framework provides a compatible theoretical foundation for producing the observed matter imbalance of the cosmos, thereby emphasizing its potential significance in early-universe cosmology.",
Cross submissions,Boomerang mechanism explaining the excess radio background,"Bhupal Dev,Pasquale Di Bari,Ivan Martinez-Soler,Rishav Roshan",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a {\em boomerang mechanism} for the explanation of the excess radio background detected by ARCADE. In an early stage, at a temperature $T \sim 100\,{\rm keV}$, a fraction of relic neutrinos is resonantly converted into dark neutrinos by mixing induced by a pre-existing lepton asymmetry. Dark neutrinos decay much later into a dark photon, mixed with photon, and a dark fermion, with a lifetime longer than the age of the Universe, as required by a solution to the excess radio background. This scenario circumvents the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment but still implies a testable lower bound.",
Cross submissions,Bouncing Cosmologies in modified gravity with space time torsion,"Sonej Alam,Somasri Sen,Soumitra Sengupta",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore the possibility of realizing a non-singular bounce in the early universe within the framework of modified gravity with spacetime torsion. In Einstein Cartan theory, torsion is embedded in the spacetime by adding an antisymmetric part in affine connection . We consider generalized version of the framework as $f(\bar{R})$, $\bar{R}$ being the scalar of the modified curvature tensor. $f(\bar{R})$ gravity is recast in Einstein frame as non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory where the scalar field gets coupled with a rank 2 antisymmetric torsion field through derivative couplings. We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations. We have also found the exact solutions of all the fields and reconstructed the modified gravity form.",
