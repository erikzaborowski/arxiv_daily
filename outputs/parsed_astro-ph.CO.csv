New submissions,Implications for dark energy of cosmic transparency in light of DESI data,"S. Dhawan,E. MÃ¶rtsell",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The distance duality relation (DDR) between luminosity and angular diameter distances holds if gravity is described by a metric theory and the universe is transparent. Recent cosmological inferences using Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations have suggested that dark energy may evolve in time. We test how the assumption of distance duality impacts dark energy inference. Marginalizing over the absolute SNe~Ia luminosity, we find no deviation from the DDR, independent of the SN~Ia compilation used, or the assumed dark energy model. This corresponds a maximum deviation in the SN~Ia luminosity of $\Delta m \sim 0.05$ mag at the highest redshift. Allowing for deviations in the DDR increases the errors in the dark energy equation of state parameters (EoS) by 30-50$\%$. For the Pantheon+ compilation the constraints on dark energy are within $2\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM when applying a more realistic minimum redshift cut $z_{\rm min} >0.023$. We constrain possible physical scenarios that can impact cosmic transparency, specifically photon-axion mixing and the presence of (gray) intergalactic (IG) dust, in the latter case limiting the dust density to $\Omega_{\rm dust}<2 \times 10^{-4}$ at 95\% C.L. When using the local Cepheid calibration of the SNe~Ia absolute luminosity, a significant deviation from the DDR relation (for which $\epsilon=0$) is preferred. However, the best fit parameter value $\epsilon = -0.091 \pm 0.024$ requires the SNe~Ia to be brighter than the case with DDR valid, therefore, neither of the physical scenarios which dim the SNe can explain the high $H_0$. Constraints on the photon-axion interaction length scale suggest a limit on the coupling constant of $g_{a\gamma} < 10^{-12}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$.",
New submissions,Blending effects on shear measurement synergy between Euclid-like and LSST-like surveys,"Shiyang Zhang,Shun-Sheng Li,Henk Hoekstra",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe for constraining cosmological parameters, but its success relies on accurate shear measurements. In this paper, we use image simulations to investigate how a joint analysis of high-resolution space-based and deep ground-based imaging can improve shear estimation. We simulate two scenarios: a grid-based setup, where galaxies are placed on a regular grid to mimic an idealised, blending-free scenario, and a random setup, where galaxies are randomly distributed to capture the impact of blending. Comparing these cases, we find that blending introduces significant biases, particularly in LSST-like data due to its larger point spread function. This highlights the importance of including realistic blending effects when evaluating the performance of joint analyses. Using simulations that account for blending, we find that the most effective catalogue-level synergy is achieved by combining all galaxies detected in either survey. This approach yields an effective galaxy number density of $44.08~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ over the magnitude range of 20.0 to 27.5, compared to $39.17~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for LSST-like data alone and $30.31~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for \textit{Euclid}-like data alone. Restricting the analysis to only the overlapping sources detected in both surveys results in a gain of ${\sim}12\%$ compared to using either survey alone. While this joint-object approach is suboptimal at the catalogue level, it may become more effective in pixel-level analyses, where a joint fit to individual galaxy shapes can better leverage the complementary strengths of both data sets. Studying such pixel-level combinations, with realistic blending effects properly accounted for, remains a promising direction for future work.",
New submissions,Exploring the signature of assembly bias and modified gravity using small-scale clusterings of galaxies,"Yirong Wang,Zhongxu Zhai,Xiaohu Yang,Jeremy L. Tinker",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We apply a halo velocity bias model, $\gamma_{f}$, within the Aemulus simulation suite for General Relativity (GR) to investigate its efficacy in identifying the signature of assembly bias and Modified Gravity (MG). In the investigation of assembly bias, utilizing galaxy clustering data ranging from scales of $0.1 - 60 \text{Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, we discover that our emulator model accurately recreates the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, along with the velocity bias $\gamma_{f}$, staying well within the 1-$\sigma$ error margins, provided that assembly bias is considered. Ignoring assembly bias can considerably alter our model constraints on parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ if the test sample includes assembly bias. Using our emulator for MG simulations, which encompasses two Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati models (DGP; N1, N5) and two $f(R)$ models (F4, F6), we can effectively identify a robust signature of modified gravity, for models such as DGP-N1 and $f(R)$-F4, as indicated by a noticeable deviation of $\gamma_{f}$ from unity. Using the velocity dispersion of dark matter halos to effectively represent the underlying strength of the velocity field of these MG simulations, we find that the simple $\gamma_{f}$ model can recover the truth with minimal bias. These evaluations indicate that our simple halo-velocity bias model is capable of detecting significant MG characteristics, although additional methodologies should be pursued to improve model constraints.",
New submissions,Examining statistical isotropy of CMB low multipoles from Planck PR4 data,"Pavan Kumar Aluri,Sanjeet Kumar Patel",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Low multipoles ($l$) in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies have shown some `peculiarities' when examined since the release of the full sky CMB maps, using a variety of tests. In this paper, we concern ourselves with the very first peculiarities seen in CMB data viz., a breakdown of statistical isotropy in the form of axiality and planarity of these low-$l$ modes, and preferred alignments among them. We scrutinize the latest CMB data from ESA's Planck mission, PR4, to evaluate the current status of these deviations. We employ the Power tensor method which allows an invariant characterization of the distribution of power in a given multipole, and apply it to probe the first sixty multipoles i.e., $l=2$ to 61. We find that there are significant number of modes that are intrinsically anisotropic with a cumulative probability of $0.3\%$. However since the planarity study reveals that those modes that are unusually planar are subset of these anisotropic modes, we conclude that they may not be intrinsically planar. The quadrupole is still well aligned with the octopole. Besides, $l=3$, higher multipoles aligned with quadrupole are found to be insignificant. Interestingly, the collective alignment axis of the first sixty multipoles is found to be broadly closer to the axis of dipole, quadrupole, octopole and other modes aligned with $l=2$.",
New submissions,Probing foreground residuals in cleaned CMB temperature maps from Planck,"Sanjeet K. Patel,Pavan K. Aluri,Pranati K. Rath,Pramoda K. Samal",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Maps of cosmic microwave background (CMB) are extracted from multi-frequency observations using a variety of cleaning procedures. However, in regions of strong microwave emission, particularly in the galactic plane from our own galaxy Milky Way and some extended or point sources, the recovered CMB signal is not reliable. Thus, a galactic mask is provided along with the \emph{cleaned} CMB sky for use with that CMB map which excises sky regions that may still be potentially contaminated even after cleaning. So, to avoid bias in our inferences, we impose such a foreground mask. In this paper, we analyze a cleaned CMB map from Planck PR4 to probe for any foreground residuals that may still be present \emph{outside} the galactic mask where the derived CMB sky is considered clean. To that end, we employ a local cross-correlation coefficient statistic where we cross-correlate widely used foreground templates that trace galactic synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission from our galaxy with the cleaned CMB sky. Using simulations, we find that few regions of the derived CMB sky are still contaminated and have to be omitted. Based on this study, we derived a mask that could be used in conjugation with the standard mask to further improve the purpose of galactic masks.",
New submissions,Probing Binary Neutron Star Merger Ejecta and Remnants with Gravitational Wave and Radio Observations,"Kara Merfeld(JHU),Alessandra Corsi(JHU)",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a study aimed at quantifying the detectability of radio counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with total masses $\lesssim 3$\,M$_{\odot}$, which may form neutron star (NS) remnants. We focus on mergers localized by gravitational-wave (GW) observations to sky areas $\lesssim 10$\,deg$^2$, a precision that greatly facilitates optical counterpart identification and enables radio discovery even without detections at other wavelengths. Widely separated GW detectors are essential for building samples of well-localized BNS mergers accessible to US-based radio telescopes, with minimum yearly detection rates (assuming the smallest values of the BNS local merger rate) ranging from a few with current GW detectors to hundreds with next-generation GW instruments. Current GW networks limit well-localized detections to $z\lesssim 0.2$, while next-generation GW detectors extend the reach to $z\lesssim 0.8$, encompassing the median redshift of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With next-generation radio arrays operating at a several tens of GHz and providing an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the most sensitive ones available today, short GRB-like jet afterglows can be detected for a large fraction of the considered BNS mergers. At lower radio frequencies, detections with current radio interferometric arrays are feasible, though subject to synchrotron self-absorption effects. The enhanced sensitivity and survey speed of future radio interferometers operating at a few GHz, combined with the higher detection rate of well-localized BNSs enabled by next-generation GW observatories, are key to probing disk-wind and dynamical ejecta afterglows, as well as remnant diversity.",
New submissions,Reconstructing dark energy with model independent methods after DESI DR2 BAO,"Jun-Xian Li,Shuang Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this paper, we employ two model-independent approaches, including redshift binning method and polynomial interpolation method, to reconstruct dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w(z)$ and DE density function $f(z)$. Our analysis incorporates data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 2, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data release 6, and three Type Ia supernovae (SN) compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5). To ensure model independence, we adopt three redshift binning schemes (n=3, 4, 5) and three polynomial interpolation schemes with the same number of nodes (n=3, 4, 5). Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) After taking into account DESI data, there is a clear trend that DE should evolve with redshift (with deviations from the cosmological constant reaching at least a $2.13\sigma$ confidence level), indicating that current observations favor a dynamical DE. 2) In the redshift range $0.5 < z < 1.5$, the DE EoS w(z) exhibits a decreasing trend and crosses the phantom divide $w=-1$, suggesting quintom-like behavior. 3) The DE density f(z) first increases at low redshift, reaching a hump around $z\approx 0.5$, and then decreases at $0.5 < z < 1.5$, with a rapid decrease at $z>1.0$. 4) For $z > 1.5$, current data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the evolution of DE, resulting in large uncertainties in the DE reconstruction. It must be emphasized that, these four main conclusions are independent of specific reconstruction models, and are insensitive to the choice of SN compilations.",
New submissions,Resolving the negative neutrino mass with cosmic birefringence,Toshiya Namikawa,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The recent measurement of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reveals a mild tension with observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This discrepancy leads to a preference for a total neutrino mass that is lower than the minimum value inferred from neutrino oscillation experiments. Alternatively, this tension can be eased within $\Lambda$CDM by assuming a higher optical depth ($\tau \simeq 0.09$), but such a value conflicts with large-scale CMB polarization data. We point out that cosmic birefringence, as suggested by recent Planck reanalyses, resolves this discrepancy if the birefringence angle varies significantly during reionization. Specifically, we consider the fact that the measured cosmic birefringence angle $\beta_0=0.34\pm0.09\,(1\,\sigma)\,$deg has the phase ambiguity, i.e., the measured rotation angle is described by $\beta=\beta_0+180n\,$deg ($n\in \mathbb{Z}$). We show that cosmic birefringence induced by axion-like particles with nonzero $n$ suppresses the reionization bump, allowing a higher $\tau$ consistent with data. We provide a viable parameter space where the birefringence effect simultaneously accounts for the low-$\ell$ polarization spectra, the Planck $EB$ correlations, and the elevated value of $\tau$, suggesting a key role for cosmic birefringence in current cosmological tensions.",
New submissions,Effects of Large Optical Depth on CD HI 21-cm Non-Gaussian Signal,"Iffat Nasreen,Kanan K. Datta,Abinash K. Shaw,Leon Noble,Raghunath Ghara,Sk. Saiyad Ali,Arnab Mishra,Mohd Kamran,Suman Majumdar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"During the Cosmic Dawn (CD), the HI 21-cm optical depth ($\tau$ ) in the intergalactic medium can become significantly large. Consequently, the second and higher-order terms of $\tau$ appearing in the Taylor expansion of the HI 21-cm differential brightness temperature ($\delta T_{\rm b}$ ) become important. This introduces additional non-Gaussianity into the signal. We study the impact of large $\tau$ on statistical quantities of HI 21-cm signal using a suite of standard numerical simulations that vary X-ray heating efficiency and the minimum halo mass required to host radiation sources. We find that the higher order terms suppress statistical quantities such as skewness, power-spectrum and bispectrum. However, the effect is found to be particularly strong on the non-Gaussian signal. We find that the change in skewness can reach several hundred percent in low X-ray heating scenarios. For moderate and high X-ray heating models changes are around $\sim40\%$ and $60\%$, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{9}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. This change is around $\sim 75\%$, $25\%$ and $20\%$ for low, moderate and high X-ray heating models, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. The change in bispectrum in both the halo cutoff mass scenarios ranges from $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 300\%$ for low X-ray heating model. However, for moderate and high X-ray heating models the change remains between $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 200\%$ for both equilateral and squeezed limit triangle configuration. Finally, we find that up to third orders of $\tau$ need to be retained to accurately model $\delta T_{\rm b}$, especially for capturing the non-Gaussian features in the HI 21-cm signal.",
New submissions,ACT DR6 Leads to Stronger Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter,"Deng Wang,Kazuharu Bamba",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Dark matter is fundamental to the composition, structure, and evolution of the universe. Combining the ACT's cosmic microwave background, DESI's baryon acoustic oscillations with DESY5 type Ia supernova observations, we find a $3.4\,\sigma$ evidence for dynamical dark matter (DDM) with an equation of state, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm0}+\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Independent of the Planck measurements, the ACT data confirms the linear relation $\omega_{dma}=-\omega_{dm0}$, inducing that the equation of state of dark matter is directly proportional to the scale factor $a$. Furthermore, the effects of DDM on the large-scale structure observables are thoroughly studied. Our findings are of great significance for understanding cosmic acceleration, structure growth, and the fate of the universe.",
New submissions,Correlation between H$Î±$ emitters and their cosmic web environment at $z \sim 1$,"Ivan Rapoport,Vincent Desjacques,Ehud Behar,Ravi K. Sheth",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Future near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy surveys will target high-redshift emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to test cosmological models. Deriving optimal constraints from emission-line galaxy clustering hinges on a robust understanding of their environmental dependence. Using the TNG300-1 simulation, we explore the correlation between properties of H$\alpha$ emitters and their environment anisotropy rather than traditional density-based measures. Our galactic H$\alpha$ emission model includes contributions from the warm interstellar medium. The environment anisotropy and type are assigned using a halo mass-dependent smoothing scale. We find that most luminous ELGs ($L_{\rm{H}\alpha}>10^{42}\ \rm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) reside in filaments and knots. More generally, ELGs are more biased in strongly anisotropic environments. While correlations with galactic properties are found to be weak, they are statistically significant for host halo masses $M\lesssim 10^{12}\ M_\odot/h$. Our analysis motivates further investigation into how environmental anisotropy influences galaxy evolution, and highlights the potential for leveraging these effects in the analyses of upcoming cosmological surveys.",
New submissions,What Prevents Resolving the Hubble Tension through Late-Time Expansion Modifications?,"Zhihuan Zhou,Zhuang Miao,Sheng Bi,Chaoqian Ai,Hongchao Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We demonstrate that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations impose the critical constraint for resolving the Hubble tension through late-time expansion modifications. Applying the Fisher-bias optimization framework to cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ data, we find that: (i) deformations in $H(z \lesssim 3)$ (via $w(z)$ reconstruction) can reconcile tensions between CC, Planck, DESI BAO, and SH0ES measurements while maintaining or improving fit quality ($\Delta\chi^2 < 0$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM); (ii) In the neighborhood of Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model, no cosmologically viable solutions targeting $H_0 \gtrsim 69$ satisfy SNe Ia constraints. MCMC validation confirms the maximum achievable $H_0 = 69.09\pm0.30$ ($\chi^2_{\rm BF} \approx \chi^2_{\Lambda\rm CDM}$) across all data combinations, indicating that the conflict between late-time $w(z)$ modifications and SNe Ia observations prevents complete resolution of the Hubble tension.",
New submissions,On the validity of separate-universe approach in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation,Rathul Nath Raveendran,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the breakdown of the separate-universe approximation during transitions in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation by analyzing the evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal R}$ and its conjugate momentum $\Pi$. It is well known that spatial gradient terms lead to a failure of this approximation, particularly at the transition from slow-roll to ultra-slow-roll phase. We show that a similar breakdown also occurs during the second transition back to slow-roll when considering the evolution of $\Pi$. Interestingly, while the homogeneous solution for $\Pi$ accurately captures the dynamics across the first transition, it is the homogeneous solution for ${\cal R}$ that becomes valid across the second. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatial curvature term introduced in the extended $\delta N$ formalism of \cite{Artigas:2024ajh} can be interpreted as arising from the contribution of $\Pi$ to the energy density perturbation. Importantly, this modification of the local Hubble parameter is valid only when the first slow-roll parameter is both small and strictly constant.",
New submissions,Multi-Model Framework for Reconstructing Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves,"A. Kaushal,A. Manchanda,M. G. Dainotti,K. Gupta,Z. Nogala,A. Madhan,S. Naqi,Ritik Kumar,V. Oad,N.

Fraija",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Mitigating data gaps in Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) light curves (LCs) holds immense value for its application in cosmological research because it provides more precise measurements of the parameter of interest of the two-dimensional Dainotti relation which is a relation among the end time of the plateau emission, Ta, its respective luminosity, La which is calculated from the fluxes at the end of the plateau, Fa. This study extends the work done byarXiv:2305.12126;arXiv:2412.20091v4on the 545 GRB sample by introducing six different models: Deep Gaussian Process (DGP), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Hybrid model of Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), Polynomial Curve Fitting and Isotonic Regression. Our findings demonstrate that Isotonic Regression achieves the highest uncertainty reduction for all three parameters (36.3% for log Ta, 36.1% for log Fa, and 43.6% for {\alpha}) outperforming all the other models. The CNN- LSTM model shows consistent improvements across all GRB parameters with the lowest outlier rate for {\alpha} (0.550%), surpassing the performance of the LSTM model inarXiv:2412.20091v4. The DGP model offers reliable uncertainty reduction across all parameters and improves upon the single-layer GP baseline. These advancements are essential for using GRBs as theoretical model discriminators via the parameters of their LCs and standard candles in cosmology, investigating theoretical models, and predicting GRB redshifts through recent cutting-edge machine-learning analysis (arXiv:2411.10736,arXiv:2405.02263;arXiv:2410.13985).",
New submissions,Scalar-induced gravitational waves from coherent initial states,"Dipayan Mukherjee,H. V. Ragavendra,Shiv K. Sethi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the impact of statistical inhomogeneity and anisotropy in primordial scalar perturbations on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). Assuming inflationary quantum fluctuations originate from a coherent state, the resulting primordial scalar perturbations acquire a non-zero space-dependent mean, violating statistical homogeneity, statistical isotropy, and parity. As a consequence of statistical inhomogeneities, SIGW acquires distinct scale-dependent features in its correlation function. Statistical anisotropies further lead to possible parity violation and correlation between different polarization modes in the tensor perturbations. Therefore, detection of these signatures in the stochastic gravitational wave background would offer probes to the statistical nature of primordial scalar perturbations beyond the scales accessible to CMB observations.",
New submissions,Enhanced Thermodynamic Framework for Third-Order Galaxy Correlation Functions: From Theory to Observations,"Sameer Choudhary,Naseer Iqbal",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present a comprehensive thermodynamic derivation and observational validation of the third-order galaxy correlation function, extending the seminal work of Iqbal et al [ 1, 2]. Using the statistical mechanics framework for gravitating systems, we derive the governing partial differential equation and provide explicit analytical solutions. Our enhanced framework includes: (1) comparison with N-body simulations and SDSS/BOSS galaxy survey data showing excellent agreement (\c{hi}2/dof = 1.27), (2) systematic methodology for determining model parameters from observational constraints, (3) detailed analysis of scale-dependent behaviour across linear and nonlinear regimes, (4) direct connections to standard cosmological parameters ({\sigma}8, {\Omega}m, fN L), (5) comprehensive treatment of redshift-space distortions, and (6) analysis of observational systematics. We demonstrate that our third-order correlation parameter b3 provides independent constraints complementary to two-point analyses, with potential to break degeneracies in dark energy and modified gravity studies. Explicit quantitative limitations regarding cosmic expansion effects and equilibrium assumptions are provided, along with comparisons to alternative methodologies and extensions for next-generation surveys.",
New submissions,Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and future challenges,"Maurizio Paolillo,Iossif Papadakis",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.",
New submissions,Listening Across the Cosmic Time: Standard Sirens from Ground- and Space-Based Missions in the Next Decade,"Alberto Salvarese,Hsin-Yu Chen,Alberto Mangiagli,Nicola Tamanini",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Precise measurement of the Hubble parameter will enable stringent tests of the standard model for cosmology. Standard sirens, using the luminosity distances measured by gravitational-wave observations of compact binary mergers, are expected to provide such measurements independently in the next decade. With the ground- and space-based gravitational wave observatories, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), different types of standard sirens altogether will place constraints across a wide redshift range. In this paper, we forecast the precisions of standard siren Hubble parameter measurements and compare various scenarios, accounting for the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty. Specifically, we find a $2\%$ constraint on $H_0$, a $1.5-3\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=1$, and a $3-5\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=7$ when combining LVK and LISA standard sirens with precise redshift measurements from electromagnetic counterpart observations. We do not find a significant improvement when including standard sirens with no EM counterpart, but which rely on features in the black hole mass distribution, and the potential systematics introduced by the possible redshift evolution of such features could further degrade the measurement accuracy if not properly accounted for.",
New submissions,EMPRESS. XV. A New Determination of the Primordial Helium Abundance Suggesting a Moderately Low $Y_\mathrm{P}$ Value,"Hiroto Yanagisawa,Masami Ouchi,Akinori Matsumoto,Masahiro Kawasaki,Kai Murai,Kimihiko Nakajima,Kazunori Kohri,Yuma Sugahara,Kentaro Nagamine,Ichi Tanaka,Ji Hoon Kim,Yoshiaki Ono,Minami Nakane,Keita Fukushima,Yuichi Harikane,Yutaka Hirai,Yuki Isobe,Haruka Kusakabe,Masato Onodera,Michael Rauch,Hidenobu Yajima",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a new constraint on the primordial helium abundance, $Y_\mathrm{P}$, based on Subaru observations. A major source of uncertainty in previous $Y_\mathrm{P}$ determinations is the lack of extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs; $0.01-0.1Z_\odot$), which have metallicities a few to ten times lower than the metal-poor galaxies (MPGs; $0.1-0.4Z_\odot$) predominantly used in earlier studies, requiring substantial extrapolation to zero metallicity. Here, we perform Subaru near-infrared spectroscopy of 29 galaxies, including 14 EMPGs. By incorporating existing optical spectra, we derive He/H for each galaxy using photoionization modeling of helium and hydrogen emission lines, including the He I 10830 Ã line to break the density-temperature degeneracy. After carefully selecting galaxies with robust He/H determinations, and adding 58 galaxies from previous studies, we obtain $Y_\mathrm{P} = 0.2387^{+0.0036}_{-0.0031}$. This $Y_\mathrm{P}$ value is $\sim1\sigma$ lower than most of the previous estimates, but agrees with recent determinations using EMPGs and the CMB constraint from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) experiment. Our result indicates $N_\mathrm{eff} = 2.54^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$, showing a mild ($1-2\sigma$) tension with the Standard Model and Planck results. These tensions may suggest a nonzero lepton asymmetry, which would be alleviated with $\xi_\mathrm{e} = 0.05^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. More observations of EMPGs and further assessments of systematic uncertainties are essential to test the potential tension more rigorously.",
New submissions,Constraining self-interacting ultrahigh-energy neutrinos by cosmic microwave background spectral distortion,"Pravin Kumar Natwariya,Shibsankar Si,Alekha C. Nayak,Tripurari Srivastava",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The neutrino telescopes have firmly established the existence of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos offer a unique probe of neutrino self-interactions. This work investigates how the self-interacting neutrinos, mediated by scalar bosons, inject energy into the medium through radiative scattering with the cosmic neutrino background, leaving an imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. The energy injection into plasma in redshift ranges, $5\times10^4\lesssim z\lesssim2\times10^6$ and $ z\lesssim5\times10^4$, leads to $\mu$-type and $y$-type of CMB spectral distortions, respectively. Using observational constraints from Cosmic Background Explorer/Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (COBE/FIRAS) and projected sensitivities from Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) experiments for $\mu$-type and $y$-type CMB distortions, we derive the stringent upper bounds on the self-interaction coupling strength as a function of mediator mass for neutrino interactions. We focus on flavor-specific self-interaction related to muon neutrinos and sub-GeV mass mediators ($m_{\phi}$). We find the upper bound on the self-interaction coupling strength to be $\sim 3.1\times 10^{-5}$ for the muon neutrino, considering UHE muon neutrino energy to be 1 PeV and PIXIE projected upper bounds on $\mu$-type CMB spectral distortion. The bound remains constant till the mediator mass reaches the center of mass energy, and after that, it gets relaxed and becomes proportional to the mediator mass. We have also compared our results with existing bounds in the literature. Our findings indicate that CMB spectral distortion could play a decisive role in exploring neutrino physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, and future missions like PIXIE can provide valuable insights.",
Cross submissions,Constraining Cubic Curvature Corrections to General Relativity with Quasi-Periodic Oscillations,"Alireza Allahyari,Liang Ma,Shinji Mukohyama,Yi Pang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We investigate observational constraints on cubic curvature corrections to general relativity by analyzing quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accreting black hole systems. In particular, we study Kerr black hole solution corrected by cubic curvature terms parameterized by $\beta_5$ and $\beta_6$. While $\beta_6$ corresponds to a field-redefinition invariant structure, the $\beta_5$ term can in principle be removed via a field redefinition. Nonetheless, since we work in the frame where the accreting matter minimally couples to the metric, $\beta_5$ is in general present. Utilizing the corrected metric, we compute the QPO frequencies within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational data from GRO J1655$-$40 and a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the coupling parameters to $|\beta_5| < (27.73\,\mathrm{km})^4$ and $|\beta_6| < (15.34\,\mathrm{km})^4$. These bounds improve upon existing constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis and the speed of gravitational waves.",

Considering a concrete K3-fibred Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold with $h^{1,1}({\rm CY})=3$ and having certain underlying symmetries, we show that the presence of multi-fibre moduli creates an assisted inflation scenario where multiple moduli collectively help in producing the cosmological observables consistent with the experimental observations. We further argue that individual field range excursions $(\Delta\phi_n)$ corresponding to each of the inflaton fields can be estimated as $\Delta\phi_n = \Delta\phi/\sqrt{n}$, where $\Delta\phi$ denotes to the effective single-field inflaton range needed to generate the desired cosmological observables, and $n$ is the number of moduli assisting the multi-fibre inflation. We also present various numerical benchmark models consistently producing cosmological observables in the lights of the recent ACT experiments.",
Cross submissions,Dark Matter Induced Neutron Production Search Limits,"Haichuan Cao,David Koltick",High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"An independent indirect detection search for Dark Matter-Matter (DM-M) interactions is undertaken to set cross section limits based on neutron production data collected by the NMDS-II detector for 1440 hours at 1166 m.w.e. and 6504 hours at 583 m.w.e.. The detector system consists of a 30 cm cube Pb-target instrumented with 60 $^3$He neutron counters. The neutron detector system calibrated with a $^{252}$Cf source yields a single particle detection efficiency of 23.2\%$\pm$1.2\%. During data collection, the highest neutron multiplicity event observed 54 neutrons. The neutron multiplicity, n, distribution, fits well to a power law $k \times n^{-p}$, for both the data and cosmic ray muon induced neutron production in Geant4 simulations. Two DM-M interaction models were used to set limits. The first, a spallation model, assumes a single proton with kinetic energy equal to the DM-M interaction energy. The other, a fire-ball model assumes an annihilation between DM-M producing pions with a limiting Hagedorn temperature. The two extreme models produce similar upper DM-M cross section limits over the DM mass range between 300 MeV to 100 GeV. Limits assume all the DM energy is deposited in the Pb-target. Spin independent limits, proportional to A$^{-2}$, are at the level ~10$^{-45}~ cm^2$. Spin dependent limits, proportional to A$^{-1}$, are at the level, $2\times 10^{-42}~cm^2$.",
Cross submissions,A unified origin for dark energy and resonant dark matter from strongly-coupled gauge theory,Martin Drobczyk,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that a single strongly coupled gauge theory naturally gives rise to a unified description of the dark sector, simultaneously addressing the origin of dark energy at the meV scale and self-interacting dark matter at the TeV scale. Building on the density-responsive scalar field framework that resolves cosmological singularities and generates dark energy without fine-tuning, we show that the same underlying SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f = 10$ flavors predicts complete dark matter phenomenology. The theory generates not only the required anomalous dimension $\gamma \approx 0.50\pm0.05$ for the dark-energy mechanism, but also produces a composite particle spectrum featuring a TeV-scale dark matter candidate ($m_\chi \approx 600$~GeV) and a heavier scalar meson. Remarkably, the mass ratio $m_{\Phi_h}/m_\chi \approx 2$ naturally emerges from the dynamics of confinement, without any fine-tuning. This resonance condition, which initially appears as a coincidence, is revealed to be a robust prediction of the gauge dynamics, completely resolving the long-standing tension between achieving the correct relic abundance and solving small-scale structure problems through self-interactions. The framework makes sharp, testable predictions: a narrow scalar resonance at $\sim 1.2$~TeV accessible at HL-LHC, dark matter self-interactions of $\sigma_T/m \sim 1$~cm$^2$/g at dwarf galaxy velocities, and a stochastic gravitational wave background from the confinement phase transition. By deriving both dark energy and dark matter from a single microscopic theory, our work demonstrates how 95\% of the universe's energy content can emerge from one underlying strongly-coupled gauge theory, providing a complete and predictive framework for dark sector physics across 15 orders of magnitude in energy.",
Cross submissions,Generating Moving Field Initial Conditions with Spatially Varying Boost,Siyang Ling,Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We introduce a novel class of algorithms, the ``spatially varying boost'', for generating dynamical field initial conditions with prescribed bulk velocities. Given (non-moving) initial field data, the algorithm generates new initial data with the given velocity profile by performing local Lorentz boosts. This algorithm is generic, with no restriction on the type of the field, the equation of motion, and can endow fields with ultra-relativistic velocities. This algorithm enables new simulations in different branches of physics, including cosmology and condensed matter physics. For demonstration, we used this algorithm to (1) boost two Sine-Gordon solitons to ultra-relativistic speeds for subsequent collision, (2) generate a relativistic transverse Proca field with random velocities, and (3) set up a spin-$1$ SchrÃ¶dinger-Poisson field with velocity and density perturbations consistent with dark matter in matter dominated universe.",
Cross submissions,Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation,"Teruyuki Kitabayashi,Aya Shimizu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.",
Cross submissions,From new physics to a running power law and back again: Minimal refitting techniques for the reconstruction of the gravitational-wave background signal in pulsar timing array data,"David Esmyol,Antonio J. Iovino,Kai Schmitz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations recently presented evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies. In this paper, we introduce new refitting techniques for PTA data analysis that elevate related techniques in the literature to a more rigorous level and thus provide the basis for fast and accurate Bayesian inference and physically intuitive model comparisons. The key idea behind our approach is to construct maps \Phi from GWB spectral models to a running-power-law (RPL) reference model, such that the pullback \Phi^* P_RPL of the RPL posterior density P_RPL induces a likelihood on the GWB model parameter space; in other words, we refit spectral models to the RPL posterior density. In order to construct \Phi, we introduce a matched-filtering approach in which \Phi follows from a \chi^2 minimization that accounts for the frequency dependence of PTA sensitivity curves. We validate and illustrate our techniques by three concrete examples: GWs from stable cosmic strings, GWs from metastable strings, and scalar-induced GWs.",
Cross submissions,Searching for quasinormal modes from Binary Black Hole mergers,"A. KrÃ³lak,O. Dorosh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.",
Cross submissions,Significance of soft-scale breaking on primordial black hole production in Coleman-Weinberg type supercooling-phase transition,"He-Xu Zhang,Katsuya Hashino,Hiroyuki Ishida,Shinya Matsuzaki",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Ultra-supercooling phase transitions can generate large overdensities in the Universe, potentially leading to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs), which can also be a dark matter candidate. In this work, we focus on the supercooling phase transition for the scale symmetry breaking based on the effective potential of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type. We investigate the effect on the PBH production in the presence of an additional mass term for the CW scalar field, what we call a soft-scale breaking term, which serves as the extra explicit-scale breaking term other than the quantum scale anomaly induced by the CW mechanism. We demonstrate that even a small size of the soft-scale breaking term can significantly affect the PBH production depending on its sign: a positive term slows down the phase transition, thereby enhancing the PBH abundance and improving the model's ability to account for dark matter; in contrast, a negative term suppresses the PBH formation. The inclusion of such soft-scale breaking terms broadens the viable parameter space and increases the flexibility of the framework. We further illustrate our results through two ultraviolet-complete realizations: i) a many-flavor QCD-inspired model as a reference model which can dynamically induce a positive-soft scale breaking; ii) a Higgs portal model with a $B-L$ scalar as the benchmark for the case where a negative-soft scale breaking is induced. Our study would provide a new testable link between PBH dark matter and gravitational wave signatures in the CW-type scenario.",
Cross submissions,The Lifespan of our Universe,"Hoang Nhan Luu,Yu-Cheng Qiu,S. -H. Henry Tye",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements claim that the dark energy equation of state $w \ne -1$. This observation can be explained by the axion Dark Energy (aDE) model of an ultralight axion plus a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Despite a relatively large degeneracy, there is a high probability that $\Lambda <0$. This negative $\Lambda$ leads the universe to end in a big crunch. Using the best-fit values of the model as a benchmark, we find the lifespan of our universe to be 33 billion years.",
Cross submissions,Cosmic Axions Revealed via Amplified Modulation of Ellipticity of Laser (CARAMEL),"Hooman Davoudiasl,Yannis K. Semertzidis",High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We propose a new axion dark matter detection strategy that employs optical readout of laser beam ellipticity modulations caused by axion-induced electric fields in a microwave cavity, using electro-optic (EO) crystals, enhanced by externally injected radio-frequency (RF) power. Building upon the variance-based probing method, PRD 107, 103005, (2023), we extend this concept to the optical domain: a weak probe laser interacts with an EO crystal placed inside a resonant microwave cavity at cryogenic temperatures, and the axion-induced electric field is revealed through induced ellipticity. The injected RF signal coherently interferes with that of the axion field, amplifying the optical response and significantly improving sensitivity. While our EO-based method employs a Fabry-Perot resonator, we do not require Michelson interferometers. Our method hence enables compact, high-frequency axion searches, across the 0.5-50\,GHz range. Operating at cryogenic temperatures not only suppresses thermal backgrounds but, critically, allows the probing method to mitigate the laser quantum noise. This approach offers a scalable path forward for axion detection over the $\sim (\text{few}-200$)~$\mu$eV mass range -- covering the preferred parameter space for the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn axion dark matter -- using compact, tunable systems.",
