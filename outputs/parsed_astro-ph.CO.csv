New submissions,The Cosmic Owl: Twin Active Collisional Ring Galaxies with Starburst Merging Front at $z=1.14$,"Mingyu Li,Bjorn H. C. Emonts,Zheng Cai,Takumi S. Tanaka,Wilfried Mercier,Yunjing Wu,Fujiang Yu,Fengwu Sun,Fuyan Bian,Emanuele Daddi,Xiaohui Fan,Xiaojing Lin,Jianwei Lyu,Jeyhan S. Kartaltepe,Francesco Valentino",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxy mergers play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution, especially by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing the gas around galaxies, triggering AGN activity and star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy merger at $z=1.14$, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting a nearly identical morphology. The grism spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN. A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation, driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a previously underappreciated yet crucial mechanism for efficient gas-to-star conversion and rapid stellar mass assembly in the early Universe.",
New submissions,Generative Models of 21cm EoR Lightcones with 3D Scattering Transforms,"Ian Hothi,Erwan Allys,Benoit Semelin,Romain Meriot",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is observed as a three-dimensional data set known as a lightcone, consisting of a redshift (frequency) axis and two spatial sky plane axes. When observed by radio interferometers, this EoR signal is strongly obscured by foregrounds that are several orders of magnitude stronger. Due to its inherently non-Gaussian nature, the EoR signal requires robust statistical tools to accurately separate it from these foreground contaminants, but current foreground separation techniques focus primarily on recovering the EoR power spectrum, often neglecting valuable non-Gaussian information. Recent developments in astrophysics, particularly in the context of the Galactic interstellar medium, have demonstrated the efficacy of scattering transforms - novel summary statistics for highly non-Gaussian processes - for component separation tasks. Motivated by these advances, we extend the scattering transform formalism from two-dimensional data sets to three-dimensional EoR lightcones. To this end, we introduce a 3D wavelet set from the tensor product of 2D isotropic wavelets in the sky plane domain and 1D wavelets in the redshift domain. As generative models form the basis of component separation, our focus here is on building and validating generative models that can be used for component separation in future projects. To achieve this, we construct maximum entropy generative models to synthesise EoR lightcones, and statistically validate the generative model by quantitatively comparing the synthesised EoR lightcones with the single target lightcone used to construct them, using independent statistics such as the power spectrum and Minkowski Functionals. The synthesised lightcones agree well with the target lightcone both statistically and visually, opening up the possibility of developing for component separation methods using 3D scattering transforms.",
New submissions,Bayesian luminosity function estimation in multidepth datasets with selection effects: a case study for $3<z<5$ Ly$Î±$ emitters,"Davide Tornotti,Matteo Fossati,Michele Fumagalli,Davide Gerosa,Lorenzo Pizzuti,Fabrizio Arrigoni Battaia",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework designed to infer the luminosity function of any class of objects by jointly modeling data from multiple surveys with varying depth, completeness, and sky coverage. Our method explicitly accounts for selection effects and measurement uncertainties (e.g., in luminosity) and could be generalized to any extensive quantity, such as mass. We validate the model using mock catalogs, recovering how deep data reaching $\gtrsim 1.5$ dex below a characteristic luminosity $\tilde{L}^\star$ are essential to reduce biases at the faint end ($\lesssim 0.1$ dex), while wide-area data help constrain the bright end. As proof of concept, we consider a combined sample of 1176 Ly$\alpha$ emitters at redshift $3 < z < 5$ drawn from several MUSE surveys, ranging from ultra-deep ($\gtrsim 90$ hr) and narrow ($\lesssim 1$ arcmin$^2$) fields to shallow ($\lesssim 5$ hr) and wide ($\gtrsim 20$ arcmin$^2$) fields. With this complete sample, we constrain the luminosity function parameters $\log(\Phi^\star/\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}) = -2.86^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$, $\log(L^\star/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) = 42.72^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, and $\alpha = -1.81^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$, where the uncertainties represent the $90\%$ credible intervals. These values are in agreement with studies based on gravitational lensing that reach $\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \approx 41$, although differences in the faint-end slope underscore how systematic errors are starting to dominate. In contrast, wide-area surveys represent the natural extension needed to constrain the brightest Ly$\alpha$ emitters [$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \gtrsim 43$], where statistical uncertainties still dominate.",
New submissions,A novel method to trace the dark matter density profile around supermassive black holes with AGN reverberation mapping,"Mayank Sharma,Gonzalo Herrera,Nahum Arav,Shunsaku Horiuchi",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). For some AGN, the mapping of multiple emission lines allows us to measure the enclosed mass within different radii from the central SMBH, which allows us to infer or constrain the dark matter density profile on sub-pc scales. We find that for five out of fourteen AGN in our identified sample, the observed enclosed mass grows with radii, hinting evidence for the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2 $\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$, consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by stellar heating processes. For the remaining AGN in our sample, we are able to derive upper limits on the dark matter density profile parameters. Interestingly, the strongest evidence for a dark matter component arises from the farthest object considered, 3C 390. This new method allows us to measure or constrain for the first time the dark matter density in the vicinity of extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and nature of dark matter.",
New submissions,Positron Signal from the Early Universe,"L. Stodolsky,J. Silk",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Bursts from the very early universe may lead to a detectable signal via the production of positrons, whose annihilation gives an observable X-ray signal. Using the absorption parameters for the annihilation photons of 511 keV, it is found that observable photons would originate at a red-shift around $z\approx$ 200-300, resulting in soft X-rays of energy $\sim$ 2-3 keV at present. Positrons are expected to be absent at these times or red-shifts in the standard picture of the early universe. Detection of the X-rays would thus provide dramatic support for the hypothesis of the bursts, explosive events at very early times. We urge the search for such a signal.",
New submissions,"Kinematic Confirmation of a Remarkable Linear Trail of Galaxies in the NGC 1052 Field, Consistent with Formation in a High-Speed Bullet Dwarf Collision","Michael A. Keim,Pieter van Dokkum,Zili Shen,Harrison Souchereau,Imad Pasha,Shany Danieli,Roberto Abraham,Aaron J. Romanowsky,Yimeng Tang",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A unique linear trail of diffuse galaxies was recently identified in the NGC 1052 field. This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and DF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It has been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two gas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are kinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a function of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and DF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven additional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses presented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain measurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a novel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on Keck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity trend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly occurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly higher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate, kinematically connected system. Our findings support the theory that this trail of galaxies, including DF2 and DF4, formed together in a single event. A 'bullet dwarf' collision remains the only known explanation for all the unusual properties of DF2, DF4, and the associated trail of galaxies.",
New submissions,Constraining the lensing dispersion from the angular clustering of binary black hole mergers,"Fumihiro Chuman,Masamune Oguri",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries provide direct measurements of luminosity distances and serve as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe. In addition to their role as standard sirens, they offer an opportunity to constrain small-scale density fluctuations through the dispersion in the distance-redshift relation induced by gravitational lensing. We propose a method to constrain this lensing dispersion without requiring the redshift information by analyzing the angular clustering of gravitational wave sources. Our formalism incorporating second-order lensing effects in the luminosity distance shows that the amplitude of the auto-correlation angular clustering decreases with increasing lensing dispersion. While we show that the auto-correlation signal is detected with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios in future gravitational wave experiments, there exists a strong degeneracy between the lensing dispersion and the linear bias of gravitational wave sources. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is partially broken by a joint analysis of the auto-correlation of gravitational wave sources and the cross-correlation with galaxies whose redshifts are known. This approach enhances the use of gravitational waves as a cosmological probe at high redshifts.",
New submissions,Testing the local supervoid solution to the Hubble tension with direct distance tracers,"Richard Stiskalek,Harry Desmond,Sergij Mazurenko,Indranil Banik",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Several observational studies suggest that the local few hundred Mpc around the Local Group are significantly underdense based on source number counts in redshift space across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in near-infrared galaxy counts. This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local Hole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the Hubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local expansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the Hubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to direct distances from the Tully--Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4 compilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void density profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of less than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by Haslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local Hubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or $70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is exponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two ameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance ladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The exponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over $1\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence. The preferred models produce bulk flow curves that disagree with recent estimates from CosmicFlows-4, despite the void models being flexible enough to match such estimates.",
New submissions,A Visibility-based 21 cm Bispectrum Estimator for Radio-interferometric Data,"Sukhdeep Singh Gill,Somnath Bharadwaj",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present a fast and scalable estimator for the binned multi-frequency angular bispectrum (MABS) and the 3D bispectrum (BS) of the redshifted 21 cm signal from radio interferometric observations. The estimator operates on gridded visibilities and leverages the FFT-based acceleration to efficiently compute the MABS and the 3D BS covering all possible triangle configurations. We present the formalism and validate the estimator using simulated visibility data for a known input model BS, considering the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations with a bandwidth of $30.72$ MHz centered at $154.25$ MHz. We consider two cases, namely, without flagging, and with flagging, which has exactly the same frequency channels flagged as the actual data. We obtain estimates of the BS for a wide range of triangle shapes covering the scales $0.003 ~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\leq k_1 \leq 1.258 ~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The estimated BS shows excellent agreement with analytical predictions based on the input model BS. We find that the deviations, which are below 20\% even in the presence of flagging, are mostly consistent with the expected statistical fluctuations. This work paves the way for reliable observational estimates of the 21 cm BS for the epoch of reionization, where the signal is predicted to be highly non-Gaussian.",
New submissions,$Î±$-attractor inflation modified by GUP in light of ACT observations,"Hana Heidarian,Milad Solbi,Soma Heydari,Kayoomars Karami",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Here, the $\alpha$-attractor inflation is investigated within a framework incorporating a minimal measurable length, as implemented by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model observational viability against recent high-precision data, primarily from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6) combined with Planck, DESI BAO, and BICEP/Keck 2018 observations (P-ACT-LB-BK18). Our results indicate that while the standard $\alpha$-attractor model ($\beta=0$) for $N_*=60$ lies near the $2\sigma$ boundary of the P-ACT-LB-BK18 dataset, the inclusion of GUP effects significantly shifts the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Notably, for the GUP parameter $\beta$ values surpassing approximately $10^{13}$, the model predictions are shown to fall well within the 68\% CL region of this combined observational data, enhancing its consistency. The viable parameter space in the $\alpha-\beta$ plane is explored, revealing that a maximum $\alpha \simeq 0.74$ is consistent with the 68\% CL for $\beta \simeq 1.4\times 10^{13}$. In addition, for smaller values of $\alpha$, the predictions of the model remain inside the 68\% CL region for larger values of $\beta$.",
New submissions,Numerical tests of cosmological AlfvÃ©n waves with Ohmic diffusion,"Orestis A. Karapiperis,Matthieu Schaller",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Physical problems with a solution that can be expressed analytically are scarce; this holds even more true for problems set in a cosmological context. Such solutions are, however, invaluable tools for making comparisons between theory, numerical experimentation and observations. In this work we present what to our knowledge is the first set of non-trivial closed-form expressions describing the behaviour of a system governed by the equations of non-ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effects of Ohmic diffusion are considered, in a cosmologically expanding frame. We provide analytical solutions that describe the time evolution of linear perturbations to a homogeneous background in a radiation-dominated universe, yielding dissipative AlfvÃ©n waves. Although in our base framework solutions for any other cosmology of interest cannot be expressed in a closed form, they can still be obtained reliably through numerical integration of the coupled system of ordinary differential equations we provide. We compare our analytical solutions to numerical results obtained using our novel implementation of Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) in the SWIFT astrophysical simulation code, to find good agreement between the two. We find the code to display good convergence behaviour, its predictions agreeing with theory to within 0.1% for a modest number of resolution elements and at a negligible computational cost. We aim this work as a companion and supplement to the cosmological ideal MHD wave tests recently presented in the literature, and suggest that it be adopted as part of standard testing of code implementations of MHD.",
Cross submissions,Viscosity in Isotropic Cosmological Backgrounds in General Relativity and Starobinsky Gravity,"Eliseo Pavone,Luigi Tedesco",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a general analysis of the role of shear viscosity in cosmological backgrounds, focusing on isotropic space-time in both Einstein and $f(R)$ gravity. By computing the divergence of the stress-energy tensor in a general class of isotropic (but not necessarily homogeneous) geometries, we show that shear viscosity does not contribute to the background dynamics when the fluid is comoving. This result holds in both the Jordan and Einstein frames, and implies that shear viscosity cannot affect the electromagnetic luminosity distance which is determined by the background light-like geodesics. As an application of our results, we critically examine recent claims that shear viscosity can alter the Hubble evolution and the electromagnetic luminosity distance in Starobinsky gravity. We demonstrate that the continuity equation used in that work is at odds both with the covariant conservation of the stress-energy tensor and the local second law of thermodynamics. We further show that even in models where such modifications could mimic bulk viscosity, the resulting entropy evolution is inconsistent with standard thermodynamic expectations.",
Cross submissions,Topological defects as effective dynamical dark energy,"Haipeng An,Chengcheng Han,Borui Zhang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we consider the possibility that the dynamical dark energy hinted at by recent DESI data may be mimicked by the effects of additional components in the universe, potentially arising from topological defects. We find that the data does not show a particular preference for the existence of cosmic strings. However, a domain wall contribution at the percent level can improve the fit, yielding a $\Delta \chi^2= -1.72$ compared to the $\Lambda \rm{CDM}$ model. The improvement indicates that topological defects remain a viable and interesting extension to $\Lambda\rm{CDM}$, meriting further investigation with future cosmological data.",
Cross submissions,Precision predictions of Starobinsky inflation with self-consistent Weyl-squared corrections,"Eugenio Bianchi,Mauricio Gamonal",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Starobinsky's $R+\alpha R^2$ inflation provides a compelling one-parameter inflationary model that is supported by current cosmological observations. However, at the same order in spacetime derivatives as the $R^2$ term, an effective theory of spacetime geometry must also include the Weyl-squared curvature invariant $W^2$. In this paper, we study the inflationary predictions of the gravitational theory with action of the form $R+\alpha R^2 - \beta W^2$, where the coupling constant $\alpha$ sets the scale of inflation, and corrections due to the $W^2$ term are treated self-consistently via reduction of order in an expansion in the coupling constant $\beta$, at the linear order in $\beta/\alpha$. Cosmological perturbations are found to be described by an effective action with a non-trivial speed of sound $c_{\textrm{s}}$ for scalar and $c_{\textrm{t}}$ for tensor modes, satisfying the relation $c_{\textrm{t}}/c_{\textrm{s}} \simeq 1+ \frac{\beta}{6\, \alpha}$ during the inflationary phase. Within this self-consistent framework, we compute several primordial observables up to the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO). We find the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 3(1-\frac{\beta}{6\alpha})(n_\textrm{s}-1)^2$, the tensor tilt $n_{\textrm{t}}\simeq-\frac{r}{8}$ and the running of the scalar tilt $\mathfrak{a}_{\textrm{s}}\simeq-\frac{1}{2} (n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^2$, all expressed in terms of the observed scalar tilt $n_{\textrm{s}}$. We also provide the corresponding corrections up to N3LO, $\mathcal{O}((n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^3)$.",
Cross submissions,Two coincidences are a clue: Probing a GeV-scale dark QCD sector,Yi Chung,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The similarity between dark matter and baryon energy densities suggests the existence of a dark sector analogous to the visible QCD sector. In addition, small-scale structure issues can be addressed by dark matter self-interactions with a cross section comparable to that of QCD. Both observations point to a GeV-scale dark QCD sector. In this letter, guided by these two coincidences, we investigate how a chiral dark QCD model with a MeV-scale dark photon can resolve the core-cusp problem. A potential third coincidence, associated with the latest measurement of $N_{\rm eff}$ being lower than the Standard Model prediction, is also discussed. Current constraints leave a finite window in the parameter space, which can be tested by future experiments such as Gamma Factory.",
