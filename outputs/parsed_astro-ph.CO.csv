New submissions,Radiation pressure role in accreting massive black hole binaries,"Fabiola Cocchiararo,Alessia Franchini,Alessandro Lupi,Alberto Sesana",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on the circumbinary discs surrounding accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at milli-parsec separations, using 3D hyper-Lagrangian resolution hydrodynamic simulations. The circumbinary discs in our simulations evolve under an adiabatic equation of state. The gas temperature is therefore allowed to change through viscous heating, black-body cooling and self-gravity. We take a significant step further by including the contribution of radiation pressure in the simulations. We model binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q= 0.7, 1$. We find that the radiation pressure significantly alters the vertical and thermal structure of the disc, resulting in a geometrically thinner, therefore colder configuration. This leads to a reduced accretion rate onto the binary and suppresses cavity eccentricity growth and precession in circular equal mass binaries. The binary eccentricity remains approximately constant, while the semi-major axis decreases over time due to net negative torque, regardless of the initial binary orbital parameters.",
New submissions,Signatures and bias assessment of rotation in galaxy cluster members,"Davide Castellani,Giovanni Ferrami,Claudio Grillo,Giuseppe Bertin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the possible presence of systematic rotation in the member galaxies of a sample of 17 nearby ($z<0.1$), rich (at least 80 identified members) Abell clusters. We also assess the extent to which low-number statistics may influence the recovery of the rotation parameters. Following the methods often used in the context of globular clusters and of clusters of galaxies, we estimate a representative value of the systematic rotation velocity and the position angle of the projected rotation axis for the set of spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies within 1.5 Mpc from the centre of each cluster. We study the robustness of our rotational velocity measurements as a function of the number of galaxies included in the analysis with a bootstrapping technique. Eight clusters with sufficiently abundant and regular data (A1367, A1650, A2029, A2065, A2142, A2199, A2255 and A2670) exhibit a significantly high rotational velocity, when compared to their velocity dispersion ($v_{rot}/\sigma\geq 0.15$). Interestingly, three of them (A1650, A2029 and A2199) are confirmed to be cool-core, relaxed clusters with no evidence of recent mergers, as suggested by X-ray observational data. We also find a general tendency to overestimate the value of $v_{rot}$ when the number of galaxies with measured velocities is reduced, for which we put forward an analytical justification.",
New submissions,Varying fundamental constants cosmography,C. J. A. P. Martins,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Cosmography is a model-independent phenomenological approach to observational cosmology, relying on Taylor series expansions of physical quantities as a function of the cosmological redshift or other analogous variables. A recent work developed the formalism for a cosmographic analysis of astrophysical and local measurements of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and provided first constraints on the corresponding parameters. Here we update the earlier work, both by including more recent measurements of $\alpha$, and by extending it to other fundamental dimensionless couplings. We find no statistically significant evidence for such variations, and place stringent constraints on the first two terms of all these cosmographic series: the linear coefficient in the $\alpha$ series is constrained to parts per billion level, thanks to recently improved atomic clock constraints, while the other coefficients are constrained to parts per million level. Additionally, we use the same data to place cosmographic constraints on models from a broad class of Grand Unified Theories in which varying fundamental constants occur, and highlight how future data can provide a discriminating cosmographic test between freezing and thawing dark energy models.",
New submissions,Impacts of axion cooling on the direct detection of supernova axions,"Kanji Mori,Masamitsu Mori",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.",
New submissions,Search for the radiative decay of the cosmic neutrino background through spectral measurements of the cosmic infrared background using PRIMA,"Yuji Takeuchi,Shuji Matsuura,Shinhong Kim,Takashi Iida",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"We propose to search for a faint yet distinguishable contribution to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) spectrum arising from the radiative decay of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). In the Standard Model of particle physics, neutrino decay is highly suppressed, with a predicted lifetime on the order of $10^{43}$ years. However, non-standard models suggest the possibility of significantly shorter lifetimes, ranging from $10^{12}$ to $10^{17}$ years. Observations to date, however, only provide a lower limit of approximately $10^{12}$ years for the neutrino lifetime. In PRIMA's low-resolution mode ($R \sim 100$), a diffuse background analysis, combined with the removal of point sources associated with known galaxies in a wide-field ($\sim 1$ square degree) spectroscopic survey covering in the 24-240 $\mu$m range could facilitate a search for neutrino decay lifetimes up to $O(10^{15})$ years. The expected signal from C$\nu$B decay at 50 $\mu$m for a neutrino lifetime of $O(10^{15})$ years is more than an order of magnitude fainter than the CIB and over three orders of magnitude fainter than the zodiacal emission foreground. Taking advantage of the characteristic spectral features of C$\nu$B decay, this level of sensitivity can be achieved with approximately 100 hours of total observation time, based on estimated surface brightness sensitivity. Searching for neutrino decay at this sensitivity could place strong constraints on several non-standard theories. A positive detection would provide compelling evidence for non-standard contributions to neutrino decay and could directly reveal the cosmic neutrino background. Furthermore, the decay photon spectrum could offer insights into the absolute mass of neutrinos, and key cosmological parameters.",
New submissions,Connecting The Hierarchically Merging Binary Black Hole Population To Their Host Galaxies,"Jordan Moncrieff,Fiona Panther",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes with masses $\sim\,80-150\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ suggests that some proportion of black hole binary systems form hierarchically in dense astrophysical environments, as most stellar evolution models cannot explain the origin of these massive black holes through isolated binary evolution. A significant fraction of such mergers could occur in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN), however connecting individual black hole mergers to host galaxies is a challenging endeavor due to large localization uncertainties. We assess the feasibility of determining the fraction of hierarchically merging black hole binaries by computing the angular cross-correlation between gravitational wave localization posteriors and galaxy catalog skymaps. We forecast when the clustering of gravitational wave sky localizations can be measured accurately enough to distinguish the AGN origin scenario from hierarchical mergers in galaxies that do not host AGN. We find that if the observed merging population is dominated by binaries formed dynamically in AGN, then this could be determined with $\mathcal{O}(5000)$ mergers detected at the sensitivity that is projected for the upcoming A\# gravitational wave detectors.",
New submissions,Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage,"Jinghao Zhang,Yacheng Kang,Jiahang Zhong,Hong-Bo Li,Liang-Duan Liu,Yun-Wei Yu,Lijing Shao",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.",
New submissions,Lensing amplitude anomaly and varying electron mass alleviate the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions,"Yi-Ying Wang,Lei Lei,Shao-Peng Tang,Yi-Zhong Fan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmological measurements have revealed tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, notably discrepancies in the Hubble constant and $S_8$ parameter. Additionally, recent observations suggested evidence of a possible non-flat spatial curvature and an anomalous CMB lensing amplitude that beyond the $\Lambda$CDM framework. In this study, we explore whether introducing a variation in the electron mass $m_e$, allowing non-zero spatial curvature $\Omega_K$, and a free lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ can resolve these persistent tensions. Without relying on any local Universe measurements, we obtain $H_0 = 69.61^{+0.60}_{-0.55} \rm \, km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$ and $S_8= 0.808\pm0.012$, with $\Delta m_e / m_e = 0.0109^{+0.0066}_{-0.0062}$ and $A_{\rm lens} = 1.030^{+0.039}_{-0.037}$, both of which exceed the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We find no indication of spatial curvature deviating from flatness, even when including the Cosmic Chronometers and SNe Ia samples. Our results point to a promising direction for cosmological models to reconcile these discrepancies, although more precise data from future experiments will be necessary to clarify these modifications.",
New submissions,Quintessential dark energy crossing the phantom divide,"Ruiqi Chen,James M. Cline,Varun Muralidharan,Benjamin Salewicz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Motivated by recent results from the DESI collaboration, we explore two classes of quintessence models that can give rise to crossing of the dark energy equation of state through the ``phantom divide'' $w=-1$. These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\dot\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.",
New submissions,Tracing Signatures of Modified Gravity in Redshift-Space Galaxy Bispectrum Multipoles: Prospects for Euclid,"Sourav Pal,Debanjan Sarkar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the galaxy bispectrum multipoles in the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, where a scalar degree of freedom mediates a fifth force that is screened in high-density environments. The model is specified by $f_{R0}$, the present-day background value of the scalar field, which controls the strength of deviations from General Relativity (GR). Using perturbation theory, we compute the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum with the full scale- and time-dependent second-order kernels, incorporating corrections from the scale-dependent growth rate and nonlinear screening. Expanding the bispectrum in spherical harmonics, we analyze the sensitivity of the multipoles to modified gravity and forecast their detectability in a \textit{Euclid}-like survey. The monopole ($B_0^0$) and quadrupole ($B_2^0$) show the strongest signatures, with relative deviations of $2\%$-$8\%$ at $z=0.7$ and $k_1\simeq0.3\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for $f_{R0}=10^{-5}$. Higher multipoles provide weaker but complementary signals. Finger-of-God damping and galaxy bias significantly modulate the results, requiring joint modeling of these nuisance parameters. For \textit{Euclid}, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios up to $\sim30$ for the monopole and $\sim15$ for the quadrupole. These results demonstrate that bispectrum multipoles are a powerful probe of gravity, capable of breaking degeneracies with bias and velocity effects and strengthening constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.",
New submissions,Dark Energy Is Not That Into You: Variable Couplings after DESI DR2 BAO,"Weiqiang Yang,Sibo Zhang,Olga Mena,Supriya Pan,Eleonora Di Valentino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) scenarios, the interaction function typically includes a coupling parameter $\xi$ that quantifies the strength of energy exchange between the dark sectors. While $\xi$ is often assumed to be constant, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a time-dependent coupling, which could provide a more general and realistic description of dark sector dynamics. In this work, we study two widely used interacting models involving pressureless DM and DE, where the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with the scale factor $a$. Specifically, we consider two parametrizations: $\xi(a) = \xi_0 + \xi_a (1-a)$ and $\xi(a) = \xi_0 \left(1 + \frac{1-a}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} \right)$, and constrain them using the latest cosmological observations, including Planck 2018 CMB data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and multiple Type Ia supernovae samples. Our results show that one scenario yields evidence for a non-zero interaction at more than 95\% confidence level, while the remaining cases indicate at most mild or inconclusive signs of interaction. These findings highlight the potential of variable coupling models and the importance of continued investigation into the nature of the dark sectors.",
New submissions,Probing the HI distribution at small scales using 21-cm Intensity Mapping at large scales,"Minal Chhabra,Somnath Bharadwaj",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) holds the potential to map the large-scale structures in the Universe over a wide redshift range $(z \lesssim 5.5)$, measure cosmological parameters, and shed light on the nature of dark energy. In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation, which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured 21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \le k_{ul} = 0.32 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely $[\Omega_{\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS and BS with an independent measurement of $\Omega_{\rm HI} $, we show that it is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation. We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy formation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores redshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we plan to address in future work.",
New submissions,The Magnetic Origin of Primordial Black Holes: A Viable Dark Matter Scenario,Subhasis Maiti,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are compelling candidates for explaining the present-day relic abundance of cold dark matter (CDM), yet their formation typically requires finely tuned early-universe dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel PBH formation mechanism within a well-established magnetogenesis framework. This scenario simultaneously accounts for the large-scale magnetic fields observed today and generates an enhanced curvature power spectrum at intermediate scales, leading to PBH formation with masses that can survive until the present epoch. We identify a narrow reheating temperature range, $10^5\,\mathrm{GeV} \leq T_{re} \leq 3\times 10^5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, within which the resulting PBHs can constitute the entirety of the observed CDM abundance. Furthermore, our model predicts a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background as a byproduct of the PBH formation process. Remarkably, the predicted GW signal lies within the sensitivity reach of upcoming space-based interferometers, such as the LISA, DECIGO, or SKA mission, offering a direct observational probe of this PBH generation mechanism.",
New submissions,Large $n$-point Functions in Resonant Inflation,"Paolo Creminelli,Sébastien Renaux-Petel,Giovanni Tambalo,Vicharit Yingcharoenrat",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate a qualitatively new regime of inflationary models with small and rapid oscillations in the potential--resonant non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the standard scenario, where most of the observable information is encoded in the power spectrum, in this regime the oscillatory signal predominantly appears in higher-order correlation functions with large $n$. This behavior emerges when the oscillation frequency $\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the theory, $4\pi f$. However, as noted by Hook and Rattazzi [2306.12489], the actual cutoff is somewhat higher--though only logarithmically--when the amplitude of the oscillations is small. We identify a phenomenologically relevant window in which $n$-point functions with $3 \lesssim n \lesssim 9$ are potentially observable. In this regime, the signal exhibits 350 - 1000 oscillations per decade in $k$.",
Cross submissions,Unified Gas Heating Constraints on Extended Dark Matter Compact Objects,"TaeHun Kim,Philip Lu,Volodymyr Takhistov",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present the first unified constraints on a broad class of extended dark matter compact objects (EDCOs) from interstellar gas heating. These include axion stars, Q-balls, axion miniclusters, dark fermion stars and primordial black holes surrounded by dark matter halos, which arise in a wide range of theories beyond the Standard Model. As such massive objects traverse the interstellar medium, their gravitational influence generates wakes and, if sufficiently compact, drives accretion flows that heat gas in their vicinity. Our general framework extends standard dynamical friction treatments by incorporating finite-size effects, internal density profiles, gas penetration through objects, and criteria for accretion disk formation. We perform detailed numerical calculations of wake formation and gas heating and apply our results to the Leo T dwarf galaxy, establishing new constraints on the dark matter fraction in EDCOs heavier than a solar mass spanning several orders of magnitude in both mass and abundance.",
Cross submissions,Imprints of screened dark energy on non-local quantum correlations,"Fabiano Feleppa,Gaetano Lambiase,Sunny Vagnozzi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.",
Cross submissions,String Corrected Scalar Field Inflation Compatible with the ACT Data,V.K. Oikonomou,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider the impact of the first string corrections of minimally coupled single scalar field theory on inflationary dynamics. Specifically we consider separately the string corrections $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi)c_2\,\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ and $\sim \alpha'c \square \phi \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$, where $\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale. Our aim is to develop a theory which is self consistent in the sense that the field equations reproduce themselves in the slow-roll approximation. Such a requirement for the theory with $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi) c_2\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ resulted to a trivial non-minimal coupling function $\xi(\phi)$, however a self-consistent framework emerged from the theory with correction term $\sim \alpha' c \square \phi \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$. The resulting theory can easily be worked out analytically and we obtained an inflationary theory that can easily be fitted with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope constraints on the scalar spectral index and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio.",
