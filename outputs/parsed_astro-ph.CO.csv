New submissions,ColdPress: Efficient Quantile-Based Compression of Photometric Redshift PDFs,Antonio Hernán-Caballero,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"ColdPress is a Python module that compresses photometric redshift probability distribution functions (PDFs) by encoding quantiles of their cumulative distribution. For a fixed packet size (the default is 80 bytes per PDF), ColdPress attains a reconstruction accuracy comparable to the sparse-basis representation method implemented in the pdf_storage module of Carrasco-Kind & Brunner (2014), yet reduces the computational cost by a factor of ~7000. I describe the implementation and quantify its compression speed and reconstruction accuracy in comparison to pdf_storage for real-life PDFs from two different photometric redshift codes. ColdPress is free software, available atthis https URL.",
New submissions,"Magnetic fields in the intracluster medium with TNG-Cluster: properties, morphology, and tangential anisotropy","Katrin Lehle,Mateusz Ruszkowski,Dylan Nelson,Marine Prunier,Annalisa Pillepich",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We characterize the magnetic field properties of 352 massive galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation with a focus on central magnetic field morphology in cool-core (CC) vs non-cool-core (NCC) clusters. We present the central values and radial profiles of magnetic field strength and plasma parameter as a function of mass, cooling status and redshift. Compared to low-redshift observations, TNG-Cluster produces reasonable magnetic field amplitudes in the central regions of clusters spanning a range of 1-200 muG. We then discuss the main finding of this work: z=0 cool-core clusters have preferentially tangential magnetic fields at a characteristic scale of ~ 0.1 r500c. These strongly tangential field orientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster population, magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and redshifts. As individual halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field topologies is diverse: tangential features can be short-lived, persist over large cosmological time-scales, or periodically appear, vanish, and reappear towards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and possible physical scenarios to explain the origin of these structures. We argue that both AGN feedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot explain the population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation. Instead, we propose that the trapping of internal gravity waves is responsible for the tangentially biased magnetic field topologies that we find in cool-core TNG-Cluster halos, due to the strong entropy gradient in these clusters.",
New submissions,"Reconstruction of Dark Matter and Baryon Density From Galaxies: A Comparison of Linear, Halo Model and Machine Learning-Based Methods","Jordan Krywonos,Yurii Kvasiuk,Matthew C. Johnson,Moritz Münchmeyer",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"For many analyses in cosmology it is necessary to reconstruct the likely distribution of unobserved fields, such as dark matter or baryons, from observed luminous tracers. The dominant approach in cosmology has been to use the so-called halo model, which assumes radially symmetric profiles centered around luminous tracers such as galaxies. More recently, field-level machine learning methods have been proposed that can learn to estimate the unobserved field after being trained on simulations. However, it is unclear whether machine learning methods indeed significantly improve over linear methods or the halo model. In this paper we make a systematic comparison of different approaches to reconstruct dark matter and baryons from galaxy data using the CAMELS simulations. We find the best results using a combined GNN-CNN approach. We also provide a general analysis and visualization of the relationship of matter, baryons, halos and galaxies in these simulations to interpret our results.",
New submissions,Sample Variance Denoising in Cylindrical 21-cm Power Spectra,"Daniela Breitman,Andrei Mesinger,Steven G. Murray,Anshuman Acharya",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"State-of-the-art simulations of reionisation-era 21-cm signal have limited volumes, generally orders of magnitude smaller than observations. Consequently, the Fourier modes in common between simulation and observation have limited overlap, especially in cylindrical (2D) k-space that is natural for 21-cm interferometry. This makes sample variance (i.e. the deviation of the simulated sample from the population mean due to finite box size) a potential issue when interpreting upcoming 21-cm observations. We introduce \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser}, a score-based diffusion model that can be applied to a single, forward-modelled realisation of the 21-cm 2D power spectrum (PS), predicting the corresponding \textit{population mean} on-the-fly during Bayesian inference. Individual samples of 2D Fourier amplitudes of wave modes relevant to current 21-cm observations can deviate from the mean by over 50\% for 300 cMpc simulations, even when only considering stochasticity due to sampling of Gaussian initial conditions. \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} reduces this deviation by an order of magnitude, outperforming current state-of-the-art sample variance mitigation techniques like Fixing \& Pairing by a factor of few at almost no additional computational cost ($\sim6$s per PS). Unlike emulators, the denoiser is not tied to a particular model or simulator since its input is a (model-agnostic) realisation of the 2D 21-cm PS. Indeed, we confirm that it generalises to PS produced with a different 21-cm simulator than those on which it was trained. To quantify the improvement in parameter recovery, we simulate a 21-cm PS detection by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) and run different inference pipelines corresponding to commonly-used approximations. We find that using \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} in the inference pipeline outperforms other approaches, yielding an unbiased posterior that is 50\% narrower.",
New submissions,Bar-driven Streaming Motions Mimic a Massive Bulge in the Inner Milky Way,Junichi Baba(Kagoshima U./NAOJ),Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its mass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational potential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \lesssim 4$ kpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear stellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies remain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling and those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics. To investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic gravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to observational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks, dark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate synthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity method to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed terminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature arises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity method to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \sim 0.4$ kpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner gas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass concentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not require a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming motions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear, Milky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of dynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate mass inference in the inner Milky Way.",
New submissions,Breaking the Mass-sheet Degeneracy in Time-delay Cosmology with Lensed and Unlensed Type Ia Supernovae,"Xiaolei Li,Kai Liao,Xuheng Ding",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This study introduces an innovative framework aimed at overcoming the ongoing issue of mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in time-delay cosmography by incorporating observations of both gravitationally lensed and unlensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). By simultaneously using lensing magnification measurements $\mu^{\rm{obs}}$ and cosmic distance ratios ($D_s/D_{ds}$), we develop a Bayesian framework capable of breaking the MSD. Specifically, we reconstruct the distance-redshift and magnitude-redshift relations from unlensed Type Ia supernovae using Gaussian process to avoid dependence on specific cosmological models. Our framework shows substantial efficacy in resolving the MSD by imposing constraints on the MSD parameter $\lambda$. Furthermore, we extend this framework to analyze multiple gravitational lensing systems. The results show strong agreement with the fiducial MSD parameters used in the data simulation, confirming our method's effectiveness in mitigating the MSD. Ultimately, this technique enables the derivation of corrected time-delay distance measurements under the MSD, improving the precision of cosmological parameters inferred from strong lensing systems.",
New submissions,Gravitational wave standard sirens: A brief review of cosmological parameter estimation,"Shang-Jie Jin,Ji-Yu Song,Tian-Yang Sun,Si-Ren Xiao,He Wang,Ling-Feng Wang,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard sirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian framework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the measurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and present the potential role of future standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy directions of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in some cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on cosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the most critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe. Finally, we introduce the challenges and the role of machine learning in future standard siren analysis.",
New submissions,Analytic Gravitational Wave Spectrum in Next-to-Minimal Bouncing Cosmology,Changhong Li,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Bouncing cosmology offers a singularity-free alternative to inflation, but its minimal realization-comprising only four cosmic phases-predicts a simple power-law stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with a narrow observational window. We introduce the next-to-minimal bouncing cosmology (NMBC), which adds an extra early contraction phase that imprints a broken power-law feature in the SGWB spectrum, enhancing detectability. Using our matrix-representation method grounded in an inequality algebra, we derive a closed-form expression for the NMBC SGWB spectrum. From this analytical result, we show that all NMBC models satisfying the current \(\Delta N_{\rm eff}\) bound \(\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2(f)<1.7\times10^{-6}\) automatically avoid the trans-Planckian problem, \(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}<0.79\,m_{\rm pl}\). These findings establish the NMBC as a self-consistent, self-contained framework capable of generating a potentially detectable SGWB in both astrophysical and laboratory searches, and demonstrate the broad utility of our matrix-representation method for future SGWB analyses in multi-phase cosmologies.",
New submissions,(Exhaustive) Symbolic Regression and model selection by minimum description length,Harry Desmond,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.",
New submissions,Robust Extraction of Global 21 cm Spectrum from Experiments with a Chromatic Beam Based on Physics-Motivated Error Modeling,"Haoran Li,Furen Deng,Meng Zhou,Yidong Xu,Xuelei Chen",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The extraction of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization faces significant challenges. The bright and anisotropic Galactic foreground, which is 4 - 6 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm signal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces additional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In this paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment, where the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be used. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the foreground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple regions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the full covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the 21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest wavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm signals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing antenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is robust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent design and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical solution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in space.",
New submissions,Gravitational Waves from First-Order Phase Transitions Assisted by Temperature-Enhanced Scatterings,Arnab Chaudhuri,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Scatterings whose cross sections increase as the cosmic temperature decreases, known as temperature-enhanced scatterings, can have a significant impact on the thermal effective potential of scalar fields responsible for driving cosmological first-order phase transitions. In this work, we systematically investigate how the inclusion of temperature-dependent corrections to the effective potential affects key phase transition parameters, including the nucleation temperature, latent heat release, and inverse duration parameter. These modifications influence both the strength and duration of the phase transition, which in turn determine the properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Employing semi-analytic computational methods, we evaluate the GW spectra generated under these conditions and compare our predictions with the projected sensitivities of forthcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. Our analysis demonstrates that temperature-enhanced scatterings can substantially strengthen the phase transition and produce GW signals that lie within the reach of future observational facilities. This study highlights the importance of temperature-dependent microphysical processes in shaping early Universe cosmological signatures.",
New submissions,Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects,"Youngsub Yoon,Yong Tian,Kyu-Hyun Chae",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we take into account.",
New submissions,Testing halo models for constraining astrophysical feedback with multi-probe modeling: I. 3D Power spectra and mass fractions,"Pranjal R. S.,Shivam Pandey,Dhayaa Anbajagane,Elisabeth Krause,Klaus Dolag",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Upcoming Stage-IV surveys will deliver measurements of distribution of matter with unprecedented precision, demanding highly accurate theoretical models for cosmological parameter inference. A major source of modeling uncertainty lies in astrophysical processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution, which remain poorly understood. Probes such as the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, X-rays, and dispersion measure from fast radio bursts offer a promising avenue for mapping the distribution and thermal properties of cosmic baryons. A unified analytical framework capable of jointly modeling these observables is essential for fully harnessing the complementary information while mitigating probe-specific systematics. In this work, we present a detailed assessment of existing analytical models, which differ in their assumptions and prescriptions for simultaneously describing the distribution of matter and baryons in the universe. Using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation, we test these models by jointly analyzing the 3D auto- and cross-power spectra of the matter and baryonic fields that underpin the above probes. We find that all models can reproduce the power spectra at sub-percent to few-percent accuracy, depending on the tracer combination and number of free parameters. Their ability to recover underlying halo properties, such as the evolution of gas abundance and thermodynamic profiles with halo mass, varies considerably. Our results suggest that these models require further refinement and testing for reliable interpretation of multi-wavelength datasets.",
Cross submissions,A Step in Flux to Suppress Axion Isocurvature,"Priyesh Chakraborty,Junyi Cheng,Matthew Reece,Zekai Wang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The QCD axion in the pre-inflation scenario faces a stringent isocurvature constraint, which requires a relatively low Hubble scale during inflation. If the axion was heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, its isocurvature is suppressed and the constraint disappears. We point out a novel mechanism for achieving this, relying on the topological nature of a BF-type (monodromy) mass for the axion. Such a mass term has an integer coefficient, so it could naturally have been very large during inflation and exactly zero by the time of the QCD phase transition. This integer can be viewed as a quantized flux, which is discharged in a first-order phase transition that proceeds by the nucleation of charged branes. This mechanism can be embedded in cosmology in several different ways, with tunneling during, at the end of, or after inflation. We provide a detailed case study of the scenario in which the tunneling event occurs during inflation. We also comment briefly on possible UV completions within extra-dimensional gauge theories and string theory. Intriguingly, the phase transition could be accompanied by the emergence of the chiral Standard Model field content from a non-chiral theory during inflation.",
Cross submissions,Sommerfeld Enhancement from Quantum Forces for Dark Matter,"Steven Ferrante,Maxim Perelstein,Bingrong Yu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Quantum forces are long-range interactions that arise only at the loop level. In this work, we study the Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections caused by quantum forces. One notable feature of quantum forces is that they are subject to coherent enhancement in the presence of a background of mediator particles, which occurs in many situations in cosmology. We show that this effect has important implications for the Sommerfeld enhancement and DM physics. For the first time, we calculate the Sommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic mediators, including the background corrections. We observe several novel features of the Sommerfeld factor that do not exist in the case of the Yukawa potential, such as temperature-induced resonance peaks for massless mediators, and having both enhancement and suppression effects in the same model with different DM masses. As direct applications, we discuss the DM phenomenology affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement from quantum forces, including thermal freeze-out, CMB spectral distortion from DM annihilation, and DM indirect detection. We highlight one particularly interesting effect relevant to indirect detection caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement in a non-thermal background of bosonic mediators in the galaxy, in which case the DM mass is shifted due to the background correction and the effective cross section for DM annihilation can be either enhanced or suppressed. This may be important for DM searches in the Milky Way.",
Cross submissions,Dark matter detection using optically trapped Rydberg atom tweezer arrays,"So Chigusa,Taiyo Kasamaki,Toshi Kusano,Takeo Moroi,Kazunori Nakayama,Naoya Ozawa,Yoshiro Takahashi,Atsuhiro Umemoto,Amar Vutha",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"A new scheme for detecting wave-like dark matter (DM) using Rydberg atoms is proposed. Recent advances in trapping and manipulating Rydberg atoms make it possible to use Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays for DM detection. We present a simple and innovative experimental procedure that searches for excitations of trapped Rydberg atoms due to DM-induced electric field. A scan over DM mass is enabled with the use of the Zeeman and diamagnetic shifts of energy levels under an applied external magnetic field. Taking dark photon DM as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed experiment can have high sensitivity enough to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark photon coupling strengths and masses.",
Cross submissions,Generation of Axions and Axion-Like Particles through Mass Parametric Resonance induced by Scalar Perturbations in the Early Universe,"Ruifeng Zheng,Puxian Wei,Qiaoli Yang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Axions and axion-like particles can be generated in the early universe through misalignment production, thermal processes, the decay of topological defects, etc. In this paper, we show that scalar perturbations in the early universe could produce a significant amount of these particles primarily through mass parametric resonance effects. Scalar perturbations induce temperature fluctuations during the particle mass transition era, e.g. during the QCD phase transition. These temperature fluctuations modulate the particle mass, transferring energy into the field through a parametric mass resonance, which is a nonlinear effect. This process exhibits a substantially unstable region that could lead to explosive particle production. Notably, this mechanism does not generate additional isocurvature perturbations.",
Cross submissions,Preheated inflation,"Diogo S. Gorgulho,João G. Rosa",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a new mechanism of non-thermal particle production during inflation based on a narrow parametric resonance, akin to the dynamics of post-inflationary preheating. The mechanism is based on the production of scalar particles with a mass that is an oscillating function of the slowly-rolling inflaton field. This is achieved in a scenario for the collective spontaneous breaking of a U(1) gauge symmetry that, while originally proposed in the context of warm inflation, leads to non-equilibrium particle production sustaining a (sub-dominant) non-thermal radiation bath throughout inflation. We show that this may leave an observational imprint, namely oscillatory features in the primordial curvature power spectrum alongside a (mild) resonant enhancement of its amplitude, as well as secondary gravitational waves that can be probed with future CMB experiments.",
Cross submissions,Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis,"Siyao Li,Masahide Yamaguchi,Ying-li Zhang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.",
