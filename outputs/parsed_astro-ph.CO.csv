New submissions,On the Energy Distribution of the Galactic Center Excess' Sources,"Florian List,Yujin Park,Nicholas L. Rodd,Eve Schoen,Florian Wolf",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources. Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier point-source analyses of the GCE.",
New submissions,Probing the ionizing photon output of galaxies near cosmic dawn with the patchy kSZ effect,"Garett Lopez,Anson D'Aloisio,Christopher Cain",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A key result from JWST's first cycles is that galaxy formation was well underway by $z=10$. The implications of these early galaxies for reionization are less clear, however. The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization state of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe of the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of high-$z$ quasars have improved to the level of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper, we use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization and the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the amplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of reionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the high-$z$ source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this correlation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and the effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of breaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity at $z=5-6$, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ power spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered sources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around $\ell = 3,000$, so measurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the history-clustering degeneracy. Our results highlight how future pkSZ measurements will complement JWST observations to improve our understanding of the ionizing sources near cosmic dawn.",
New submissions,A Metal-Free Galaxy at $z = 3.19$? Evidence of Late Population III Star Formation at Cosmic Noon,"Sijia Cai,Mingyu Li,Zheng Cai,Yunjing Wu,Fujiang Yu,Mark Dickinson,Fengwu Sun,Xiaohui Fan,Ben Wang,Fergus Cullen,Fuyan Bian,Xiaojing Lin,Jiaqi Zou",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx822$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $\approx2814$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, are currently detected at statistically significant level, placing a 2-$\sigma$ abundance upper limit of 12+log(O/H) < 6.52 ($Z < 8\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$). The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $\approx13.9$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.",
New submissions,Not-quite-primordial black holes seeded by cosmic string loops,Bryce Cyr,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Cosmic strings appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ at high redshifts. Interestingly, for reasonable values of the string parameters, one can reproduce the abundance of ``Little Red Dots"" as inferred by JWST.",
New submissions,DESIgning concordant distances in the age of precision cosmology: the impact of density fluctuations,"David Camarena,Kylar Greene,John Houghteling,Francis-Yan Cyr-Racine",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Discrepancies between distance measurements and $\Lambda$CDM predictions reveal notable features in the distance-redshift relation, possibly suggesting the presence of an evolving dark energy component. Given the central role of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in modeling cosmological distances, we investigate here whether these features instead point to a possible departure from the fundamental FLRW symmetries. Exploiting the transverse and line-of-sight distances provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations, we demonstrate that observed distances hint at a slight but systematic preference for an anisotropic expansion rate emerging regardless of the dark energy model considered. Leveraging this non-FLRW feature, we investigate an inhomogeneous extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model that naturally provides an anisotropic expansion rate. Our analysis demonstrates that models featuring spherical overdensities can explain BAO, supernova, and cosmic microwave background data, providing fits statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with a phantom dark energy scenario. When Pantheon+ data is considered, our analysis challenges the FLRW framework at $2.8\sigma$ and yields scenarios that can be interpreted as subtle but non-negligible deviations from the FLRW metric. When DESY5 supernovae are considered instead, deviations are notably more significant, yielding scenarios that mildly violate the Copernican principle and exclude the FLRW assumption at $5.2\sigma$. Overall, our results motivate a more in-depth investigation of whether the perfectly homogeneous and isotropic FLRW paradigm can still be assumed to accurately predict cosmological distances in the era of precision cosmology.",
New submissions,Variational autoencoder for generating realistic $N$-body simulations for dark matter halos,"Jazhiel Chacón-Lavanderos,Isidro Gómez-Vargas,Ricardo Menchaca-Mendez,J. Alberto Vázquez",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this paper, we explore the use of a variational autoencoder (VAE), a deep generative model, to compress and generate images of dark matter density fields from $\Lambda$CDM like cosmological simulations. The VAE learns a compact, low-dimensional representation of the large-scale structure, enabling both accurate reconstruction and generation of statistically realistic samples. We evaluated the generated images by comparing their power spectra to those of real simulations and the theoretical $\Lambda$CDM prediction, finding strong agreement with the state-of-the-art simulations. In addition, the VAE provides a fast and scalable method for generating synthetic cosmological data, making it a valuable tool for data augmentation. These capabilities can accelerate the development and training of more advanced machine learning models for cosmological analysis, particularly in scenarios where large-scale simulations are computationally expensive. Our results highlight the potential for generative artificial intelligence as a practical bridge between physical modeling and modern deep learning in cosmology.",
New submissions,Optimising the sample selection for photometric galaxy surveys,"Marc Alemany-Gotor,Isaac Tutusaus,Pablo Fosalba",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Determining cosmological parameters with high precision, as well as resolving current tensions in their values derived from low and high redshift probes, is one of the main objectives of the new generation of cosmological surveys. The combination of complementary probes in terms of parameter degeneracies and systematics is key to achieving these ambitious scientific goals. In this context, determining the optimal survey configuration for an analysis that combines galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, remains an open problem. In this paper, we present an efficient and flexible end-to-end pipeline to optimise the sample selection for 3x2pt analyses in an automated way. Our pipeline is articulated in two main steps: we first consider a self-organising map to determine the photometric redshifts of a simulated galaxy sample. As a proof of method for stage-IV surveys, we use samples from the DESC Data Challenge 2 catalogue. This allows us to classify galaxies into tomographic bins based on their colour phenotype clustering. We then explore different redshift-bin edge configurations for weak lensing only as well as 3x2pt analyses in a novel way. Our method explores multiple configurations of perturbed redshift-bin edges with respect to the fiducial case in an iterative manner. In particular, we sample tomographic configurations for the source and lens galaxies separately. We show that, using this method we quickly converge into an optimised configuration for different numbers of redshift bins and cosmologies. Our analysis demonstrates that for stage-IV surveys an optimal tomographic sample selection can increase the figure of merit of the dark energy (DE) equation of state by a factor of $\sim$2, comparable to an effective increase in survey area of $\sim$4 for non-optimal photometric survey analyses.",
New submissions,Phantom crossing or dark interaction?,"Sêcloka L. Guedezounme,Bikash R. Dinda,Roy Maartens",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent results from DESI BAO measurements, together with Planck CMB and Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\rm de}<-1$) in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$ is used to fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but effective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$. The energy flows from dark matter to dark energy at early times and reverses at later times.",
New submissions,A continuity equation compatible basis for Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy,"Federico Armato,Edoardo Martinelli,Marco Raveri",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Effective Field Theory (EFT) of Dark Energy (DE) is a model independent framework that allows for the description of a wide class of dark energy and modified gravity models. This is achieved by extending the Hilbert Einstein action through the introduction of time dependent functions. However, the choice of these functions and thus the operator basis is not unique. In this paper, we propose a physically motivated constraint based on the continuity equation, leading to a continuity equation compatible (CEC) basis that ensures a clear physical interpretation of the background EFT operators.",
New submissions,Galaxy quenching across the Cosmic Web: disentangling mass and environment with SDSS DR18,"Anindita Nandi,Biswajit Pandey",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the influence of large-scale cosmic web environments on galaxy quenching using a volume-limited, stellar mass-matched galaxy sample from SDSS DR18. Galaxies are classified as residing in sheets, filaments, or clusters based on the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor derived from the smoothed density field. The quenched fraction increases with stellar mass and is highest in clusters, intermediate in filaments, and lowest in sheets, reflecting the increasing efficiency of environmental quenching with density. A flattening of the quenched fraction beyond $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 10.6$ across all environments signals a transition from environment-driven to mass-driven quenching. In contrast, the bulge fraction continues to rise beyond this threshold, indicating a decoupling between star formation suppression and morphological transformation. At the high-mass end ($\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.5$), both quenched and bulge fractions bifurcate, increasing in clusters but declining in sheets, suggesting a divergent evolutionary pathway where massive galaxies in sheets retain cold gas and disk-like morphologies, potentially sustaining or rejuvenating star formation. The AGN fraction also increases with stellar mass and is somewhat higher in sheets than in clusters, indicating enhanced AGN activity in low-density, gas-rich environments. The high-mass trends are independently corroborated by our analysis of specific star formation rate, $(u-r)$ colour, concentration index, and D4000 in the stellar mass-density plane, which show that massive galaxies in sheets remain bluer, younger, more star-forming, and structurally less evolved than their cluster counterparts. Our results highlight the cosmic web as an active driver of galaxy evolution.",
Cross submissions,Ultralight dark matter detection with trapped-ion interferometry,"Leonardo Badurina,Diego Blas,John Ellis,Sebastian A. R. Ellis",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We explore how recent advances in the manipulation of single-ion wave packets open new avenues for detecting weak magnetic fields sourced by ultralight dark matter. A trapped ion in a ``Schrödinger cat'' state can be prepared with its spin and motional degrees of freedom entangled and be used as a matter-wave interferometer that is sensitive to the Aharonov-Bohm-like phase shift accumulated by the ion over its trajectory. The result of the spin-motion entanglement is a parametrically-enhanced sensitivity to weak magnetic fields as compared with an un-entangled ion in a trap. Taking into account the relevant boundary conditions, we demonstrate that a single trapped ion can probe unexplored regions of kinetically-mixed dark-photon dark matter parameter space in the $10^{-15}~\text{eV} \lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 10^{-14}$~eV mass window. We also show how such a table-top quantum device will also serve as a complementary probe of axion-like particle dark matter in the same mass window.",
Cross submissions,Multiple Populations of Same Sterile Neutrino as Dark Matter,"Muping Chen,Graciela B. Gelmini,Philip Lu,Volodymyr Takhistov",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Sterile neutrinos produced in the early Universe that mix with active neutrinos of the Standard Model are typically considered to consist of a single population resulting from one dominant production mechanism. We show that the same sterile neutrino species can naturally emerge with multiple population components, yielding a multi-modal relic momentum spectrum. We consider this with four distinct production scenarios: active-sterile non-resonant oscillations following resonant oscillations in the presence of a primordial lepton asymmetry, gravitational production through sterile neutrinogenesis from populations of evaporating primordial black holes, and heavy singlet Higgs or inflaton decays combined with non-resonant active-sterile oscillations or neutrinogenesis. We identify sterile neutrino mass ranges where a colder and a hotter population can be present with similar contributions and can also contribute non-negligibly to the dark matter relic abundance. We discuss some potential consequences of such a multi-population framework.",
Cross submissions,Updated constraints on modified gravity from binary pulsars,"S. Bussieres,M. Caldarola,S. Nesseris",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Binary pulsars offer a unique natural laboratory to test General Relativity (GR) and probe for deviations from its paradigm, as predicted by alternative theories of gravity. In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a time variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar gravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars, namely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the Keplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital dynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian parameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do this via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python pipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different binary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and the dipolar emission parameter $\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars (PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{-12}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint on the dipolar emission parameter, $\kappa_D = (-0.04 \pm 0.14) \times 10^{-4}$. Thanks to the recent high-precision timing data sets, we provide updated bounds on key parameters relevant to modified gravity theories, and we find that our results are consistent with GR.",
Cross submissions,Topological dark energy from spacetime foam: A challenge for $Λ$CDM,"Fotios K. Anagnostopoulos,Stylianos A. Tsilioukas,Emmanuel N. Saridakis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Using only the standard considerations of spacetime foam and the Euclidean Quantum Gravity techniques known long ago, we result to a model of Topological Dark Energy (TDE) that outperforms the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm with regard to data fitting efficiency. Specifically, it is known that at the foam level, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the particular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective dynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the latter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can immediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of the topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this TDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic evolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We confront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with Pantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model selection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but statistically significant preference over $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Finally, we show that the TDE scenario passes constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and thus does not spoil the thermal history of the Universe.",
