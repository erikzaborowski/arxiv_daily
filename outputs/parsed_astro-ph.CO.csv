New submissions,pop-cosmos: Star formation over 12 Gyr from generative modelling of a deep infrared-selected galaxy catalogue,"Sinan Deger,Hiranya V. Peiris,Stephen Thorp,Daniel J. Mortlock,Gurjeet Jagwani,Justin Alsing,Boris Leistedt,Joel Leja",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study star formation over 12 Gyr using pop-cosmos, a generative model trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 $<26$). The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star formation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\pm0.01$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent (Q) galaxies using specific SFR $<10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$ colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent fractions across $0<z<3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by galaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass function shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($<10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$) Q galaxies at $z\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase. Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback time ($r\sim1$ to $r\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r>0.95$) during the most recent $\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive ($10<\log_{10}(M_*/$M$_{\odot})<11$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of $\sim1$ Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive ($\sim10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$) galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states, declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the $\sim1$ Gyr quenching transition.",

Percival,Francisco Prada,Ignasi Pérez-Ràfols,Graziano Rossi,Eusebio Sanchez,David Schlegel,Michael Schubnell,Joseph Harry Silber,David Sprayberry,Gregory Tarlé,Benjamin Alan Weaver,Rongpu Zhou,Hu Zou",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present the most precise and lowest-mass weak lensing measurements of dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$ up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})<$9.25) -- opening up a new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales $\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.",
New submissions,A roadmap to cosmological parameter analysis with third-order shear statistics IV. Analytic cross-covariance between second- and third-order aperture masses,"Niek Wielders,Laila Linke,Pierre A. Burger,Sven Heydenreich,Lucas Porth,Peter Schneider",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology, with second-order shear statistics commonly used to constrain parameters such as the matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and the clustering amplitude $S_8$. However, parameter degeneracies remain and can be reduced by including higher-order statistics such as the third-order aperture mass. To jointly analyse second- and third-order statistics, an accurate model of their cross-covariance is essential. We derive and validate a non-tomographic analytical model for the cross-covariance between second- and third-order aperture mass statistics. Analytical models are computationally efficient and enable cosmological parameter inference across a range of models, in contrast to numerical covariances derived from simulations or resampling, which are costly or biased. Our derivation is based on real-space estimators of the aperture mass. Substituting the Halofit power spectrum, BiHalofit bispectrum, and a halo-model tetraspectrum, we validate the model against numerical covariances from the $N$-body Scinet LIghtCone Simulations (SLICS) using shear catalogues and convergence maps. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis with both analytical and numerical covariances for several filter scale combinations. The cross-covariance separates into three terms governed by the power spectrum, bispectrum, and tetraspectrum, with the latter dominating. The analytical model qualitatively reproduces simulations, though differences arise from modelling approximations and numerical evaluation. Analytical contours are systematically tighter, with a combined figure of merit 72% of the numerical case, rising to 80% when small-scale information is excluded. This work completes the analytical covariance framework for second- and third-order aperture mass statistics, enabling joint parameter inference without large simulation suites.",
New submissions,A GLIMPSE of Intermediate Mass Black holes in the epoch of reionization: Witnessing the Descendants of Direct Collapse?,"Qinyue Fei,Seiji Fujimoto,Rohan P. Naidu,John Chisholm,Hakim Atek,Gabriel Brammer,Yoshihisa Asada,Volker Bromm,Lukas J. Furtak,Jenny E. Greene,Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao,Junehyoung Jeon,Vasily Kokorev,Jorryt Matthee,Priyamvada Natarajan,Johan Richard,Alberto Saldana-Lopez,Daniel Schaerer,Marta Volonteri,Adi Zitrin",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5<z<7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.",
New submissions,On the Fate of Little Red Dots,"Andres Escala,Lucas Zimmermann,Sebastian Valdebenito,Marcelo C. Vergara,Dominik R. G. Schleicher,Matias Liempi",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We study the stability and possible fates of Little Red Dots, under the stellar-only interpretation of their observational features. This is performed by a combination of analyzing the relevant timescales in their stellar dynamics and also, the application of recent numerical results on the evolution of the densest stellar systems. We study different scenarios for the evolution of Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. We conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most probably formed directly in the supermassive range",
New submissions,A DECADE of dwarfs: first detection of weak lensing around spectroscopically confirmed low-mass galaxies,"Chun-Hao To,Chihway Chang,Dhayaa Anbajagane,Risa H. Wechsler,Alex Drlica-Wagner,M. Adamów,A. Alarcon,M. R. Becker,J. A. Carballo-Bello,R. Cawthon,N. Chicoine,C. Doux,J. H. Esteves,P. S. Ferguson,M. Gatti,D. Gruen,R. A. Gruendl,K. Herron,David J.

Suson,C. Y. Tan,R. Teixeira,A. Zenteno,Z. Zhang(DELVE Collaboration)",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present the first detection of weak gravitational lensing around spectroscopically confirmed dwarf galaxies, using the large overlap between DESI DR1 spectroscopic data and DECADE/DES weak lensing catalogs. A clean dwarf galaxy sample with well-defined redshift and stellar mass cuts enables excess surface mass density measurements in two stellar mass bins ($\log \rm{M}_*=[8.2, 9.2]~M_\odot$ and $\log \rm{M}_*=[9.2, 10.2]~M_\odot$), with signal-to-noise ratios of $5.6$ and $12.4$ respectively. This signal-to-noise drops to $4.5$ and $9.2$ respectively for measurements without applying individual inverse probability (IIP) weights, which mitigates fiber incompleteness from DESI's targeting. The measurements are robust against variations in stellar mass estimates, photometric shredding, and lensing calibration systematics. Using a simulation-based modeling framework with stellar mass function priors, we constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation and find a satellite fraction of $\simeq 0.3$, which is higher than previous photometric studies but $1.5\sigma$ lower than $\Lambda$CDM predictions. We find that IIP weights have a significant impact on lensing measurements and can change the inferred $f_{\rm{sat}}$ by a factor of two, highlighting the need for accurate fiber incompleteness corrections for dwarf galaxy samples. Our results open a new observational window into the galaxy-halo connection at low masses, showing that future massively multiplexed spectroscopic observations and weak lensing data will enable stringent tests of galaxy formation models and $\Lambda$CDM predictions.",
New submissions,Gaussian Planck Relics are Ruled-Out as Dark Matter by LIGO,"Oem Trivedi,Abraham Loeb",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Quantum Gravity models suggest that singularities in gravitational collapse can be replaced by bounces, leading to the formation of Planck star remnants (PSR) that survive as stable relics once the black holes evaporate to the Planck mass. Recently, we proposed that such relics can be a viable candidate for dark matter. Here we show that LIGO's upper limit on the gravitational wave background rules out a formation pathway of Planck mass relics as dark matter from Gaussian initial conditions. This leaves non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations as the only viable channel for making Planck mass relics as dark matter.",
New submissions,Merger-Induced Disturbance and Temporal Signatures in Galaxy Clusters: A Combined Phase Space and Photometric Analysis,"Chuiyang Kong,Ian Dell'Antonio",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present a physically interpretable framework to quantify dynamical disturbances in galaxy clusters using projected two-dimensional phase-space information. Based on the TNG-Cluster simulation, we construct a disturbance score that captures merger-driven asymmetries through features such as velocity dispersion and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) peak fitting, which captures asymmetries indicative of dynamical disturbance. All features are derived from observable quantities and are intended to be measurable in future surveys.To enable observational application, we adopt a simplified estimator using aperture mass map statistics as a mass ratio proxy in TNG300-1, and validate its performance with weak lensing data from The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). While phase-space diagnostics reveal merger-driven asymmetries, they are not sensitive to whether the secondary progenitor is infalling or receding, and thus cannot distinguish future mergers from past mergers. To address this, we incorporate the star formation rate (SFR) from TNG-Cluster and propose the blue galaxy fraction as a promising observational tracer of merger timing.Finally, we construct mock Chandra X-ray images of TNG-Cluster halos at redshift $z=0.2$, and find that the offset between the X-ray peak and the position of the most massive black hole (used as a proxy for the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, BCG) correlates with our disturbance score, serving as a consistency check. We also perform case studies using LoVoCCS observational data, correlating the blue galaxy fraction with disturbance scores derived from the eROSITA morphology catalog.",
New submissions,Cosmic Multipoles in Galaxy Surveys II: Comparing Different Methods in Assessing the Cosmic Dipole,"Vasudev Mittal,Oliver T. Oayda,Geraint F. Lewis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a comparative analysis of estimators and Bayesian methods for determining the number count dipole from cosmological surveys. The increase in discordance between the number count dipole and the CMB's kinematic dipole has presented a challenge to the assumption of an isotropic and homogeneous universe. The level of discordance has depended on the choice of method to determine the dipole; hence, there is a need to compare them to determine the better approach. We select the healpy fit_dipole algorithm as our estimator and show that it gives unbiased results regardless of the noise levels and sky coverage in the data. However, for low sky coverage, the estimator's results have a large variance, which indicates that the estimator is not reliable in that regime. We then compare the estimator's outputs with the Bayesian results. If the sky coverage is sufficient, the Bayesian posterior probabilities agree with both the estimator's outcomes and the true parameter values. But if the sky coverage is low, Bayesian analysis is often inconclusive, which safeguards against incorrect conclusions. Both methods provide the ability to analyse multiple samples: on one hand, we need to select a different estimator, while in Bayesian inference, we need to extend our likelihood function to incorporate additional parameters. Our study emphasises the need to perform a principled statistical analysis of sky surveys for dipole determination.",
New submissions,A New Precise Measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Temperature at $z=0.89$ Toward PKS1830-211,"Tatsuya Kotani,Tomoharu Oka,Rei Enokiya,Kazuki Yanagihara,Miyuki Kaneko,Ryo Ariyama",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this study, we analyzed millimeter-wave data toward the quasar PKS1830-211 observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to obtain absorption spectra of HCN $J$=2-1, $J$=3-2, $J$=4-3, and $J$=5-4 lines at the cosmological redshift of $z=0.89$. We confirmed multiple absorption components in each spectrum, and the two lower-$J$ lines are highly saturated at velocity centers of the two most prominent components. The effect of uncertainty in the continuum covering factor was carefully assessed using a Monte Carlo approach. We also accounted for systematic uncertainties in the HCN $J$=4-3 and $J$=5-4 absorption due to time variability during an intense flaring event of the quasar. Assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and neglecting molecular collisions, we derived the excitation temperature profiles and their uncertainties in the optically thin regime. We determined the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature at $z = 0.89$ to be ${5.13\pm0.06\,\mathrm{K}}$ by taking a weighted average of calculated excitation temperatures; this is highly consistent with that expected from the standard model of the universe.",
New submissions,Galactic Contrail in NGC 3627 caused by Dwarf Galaxy Candidate or Massive Black Hole Flyby,"Mengke Zhao,Guang-Xing Li",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We report the discovery of a kpc scale molecular contrail in the spiral galaxy NGC 3627, a narrow structure spanning 8 kpc in length with a width of 200 pc and an extreme aspect ratio of 40, observed in both mid-infrared dust emission (PHANGS-JWST) and CO(2-1) gas (PHANGS-ALMA). This contrail size significantly exceeds the size of any known analogs in the Milky Way and exhibits supersonic turbulence (10 km/s). Its morphology and dynamics are consistent with gravitational focusing by a flyby compact object of mass 1e6 M_sun, likely a massive black hole or a dwarf galaxy nucleus, traversing the disk at >300 km/s. The crossing time of such a contrail, estimated from its width and velocity dispersion, is only $\sim 20$ Myr, implying a recent interaction. This contrail can be caused by a dwarf galaxy, or massive black hole nucleus. This discovery establishes galactic-scale contrails as probes of massive dark objects interacting with medium in and around galactic disks.",
New submissions,Probing redshift-dependent systematics in the Hubble tension: Model-independent $H_0$ constraints from DESI R2,"Tonghua Liu,Shuo Cao,Jieci Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a model-independent determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) using the latest observational data from multiple cosmological probes. By combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2), cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and the Pantheon Plus Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, we reconstruct the cosmic expansion history through Gaussian process regression without assuming a specific cosmological model or relying on sound horizon calibration. Our analysis incorporates the complete covariance structure of the measurements and yields $H_0$ constraints at five distinct redshifts: $65.72 \pm 1.99$ (z=0.51), $67.78 \pm 1.75$ (z=0.706), $70.74 \pm 1.39$ (z=0.934), $71.04 \pm 1.93$ (z=1.321), and $68.37 \pm 3.95~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (z=1.484). The optimal combination of these measurements gives $\hat{H}_0 = 69.0 \pm 1.0~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ with 1.4\% precision, which occupies an intermediate position between the Planck CMB result and the SH0ES local measurement and is consistent with the TRGB result. Rather than providing a single integrated $H_0$ value, our approach delivers independent constraints at multiple redshifts, thereby enabling a detailed investigation of potential redshift-dependent systematic effects that could contribute to the Hubble tension. We identify significant correlations between adjacent redshift bins ($\rho = -0.033$ to $0.26$), primarily arising from the BAO covariance and reconstruction effects. These results demonstrate a clear redshift evolution in Hubble constant measurements and suggest that the Hubble tension may involve more complex redshift-dependent effects than a simple dichotomy between early and late universe probes.",
New submissions,A sample of 3403 galaxy clusters identified in XMM-Newton X-ray images,"Z. S. Yuan,Z. L. Wen,W. Xu,J. L. Han",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Currently, the number of galaxy clusters identified using galaxy data has far exceeded the number derived from intracluster medium data. In this study, we used positional information from large optical cluster catalogues to search for previously unrecognized X-ray galaxy clusters in archival XMM-Newton data. We successfully identified 1490 galaxy clusters in X-ray images for the first time. By incorporating 1913 previously known X-ray clusters, we constructed a sample of 3403 galaxy clusters observed by XMM-Newton. Our cluster mass estimates show broad consistency with previous measurements. Comparative analyses between the known and newly identified subsamples revealed that new X-ray clusters exhibit systematically higher redshifts, lower masses, and smaller X-ray-to-optical mass ratios, but show no systematic differences in dynamical properties. The newly identified X-ray clusters are a valuable addition to previous X-ray samples and are important for future statistical studies.",
New submissions,Resistive Scaling in the Magnetic Helicity-Driven Inverse Cascade,"Jiyao Zhang,Axel Brandenburg",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The inverse cascade in MHD turbulence plays a crucial role in various astrophysical processes such as galaxy cluster formation, solar and stellar dynamo mechanisms, and the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in the early universe. A standard numerical approach involves injecting magnetic helicity at intermediate length scales to generate a secondary, time-dependent spectral peak that gradually propagates toward larger scales. Previous simulations have already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density $\epsilon_\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have $E_\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\mathrm{H} \epsilon_\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where $C_\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient analogous to the Kolmogorov constant. We present a summary of the 25 distinct simulations conducted with the \textsc{Pencil Code}, systematically varying the forcing wavenumber $k_\mathrm{f}$, magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$, grid resolution $N^3$, and Lundquist number $Lu$. We obtained $C_\mathrm{H}$ and corresponding error bars by calculating the compensated spectrum and investigated its dependence with $Lu$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$. For the $C_\mathrm{H}$ - $Lu$ relationship, we observe strong correlations with power-law exponents of 1 and 2/3. In contrast, we find no significant correlation between $C_\mathrm{H}$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$.",
Cross submissions,Collider probes of baryogenesis with maximal CP asymmetry,"Debasish Borah,Kun Cheng,Arnab Dasgupta,Tao Han,Keping Xie",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"We propose a novel collider probe of baryogenesis at TeV scale by measuring decay asymmetries into particle and anti-particle final states. Motivated by the idea of Dirac leptogenesis, we consider an extension of the standard model with new colored and $SU(2)_L$ singlet particles in such a way that the out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy colored fermions creates equal and opposite CP asymmetries in two sectors, prevented from equilibrating with each other. While the TeV scale viability of this mechanism requires a resonantly enhanced CP asymmetry, the latter also plays a crucial role leading to observable decay asymmetries in colliders. In addition to discussing conventional signatures of such heavy colored particles, namely, mono-jet plus missing transverse energy, displaced vertex, colored track at hadron colliders, we also show the unique possibility of measuring decay asymmetries via forward-backward and charge asymmetries at future muon colliders. In addition to being a verifiable TeV-scale baryogenesis scenario, the model also predicts a singlet scalar dark matter candidate consistent with the required thermal dark matter properties near the Higgs resonance.",
Cross submissions,Scalaron dark matter dynamics: effects of Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity,"Shibendu Gupta Choudhury,Koushik Dutta,Deep Ghosh",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"One of the key features of the $R^2$-gravity is the embedding of a scalar field, scalaron, into the gravity sector. The scalaron interacts with the Standard Model (SM) matter fields through Planck-suppressed couplings. If the scalaron serves as a viable dark matter (DM) candidate, it can account for the lack of evidence of DM interactions beyond gravity in experimental and observational probes to date. The realization of the scalaron, as a cold DM candidate, depends on an induced trilinear interaction with the SM Higgs, despite its suppressed coupling strength. Here, we introduce a Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity that additionally contributes to the induced trilinear interaction with its existing competing part, originated from the $R^2$-gravity. We study the interplay between these two contributions in the early universe, which determines both the initial conditions and evolution of the scalaron, leading to cold DM behavior at a later epoch. The trilinear interaction vanish identically for certain combinations of the Higgs non-minimal coupling and the scalaron mass, thereby setting the scalaron density through misalignment mechanism, similar to axions. Consequently, we find that the observed DM relic density is obtained for a scalaron mass between $1.38$ keV and $0.7$ MeV. The lower limit on the mass stems from the LHC constraints on the Higgs non-minimal coupling, whereas the upper bound arises from INTEGRAL/SPI limits on the excess gamma-ray flux from possible scalaron decays to two photons.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational waves from two scalar fields unifying the dark sector with inflation,"Orlando Luongo,Tommaso Mengoni,Paulo M. Sá",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields, while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons. Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions, i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties discussed in detail.",
Cross submissions,Probing Light Dark Matter with Cosmic Gravitational Focusing,"Shao-Feng Ge,Liang Tan",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the possibility of using the cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) to probe the minor light dark matter (DM) component whose mass is in the range of $(0.1 \sim 100)$\,eV. Being a purely gravitational effect, the CGF offers a mode-independent probe that is complementary to the existing ways such as Lyman-$\alpha$ and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Such effect finally leads to a dipole density distribution that would affect the galaxy formation and hence can be reconstructed with galaxy surveys such as DESI. Both the free-streaming and clustering limits have been studied with analytical formulas while the region in between is bridged with interpolation. We show the projected sensitivity at DESI with the typical phase space distribution of a freeze-in DM scenario as illustration.",
Cross submissions,Primordial black holes formation in inflationary $F(R)$ models with scalar fields,"E.O. Pozdeeva,S.Yu. Vernov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model. For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter candidates.",
