New submissions,Modeling gravitational wave sources in the MillenniumTNG simulations,"Federico Marinacci,Marco Baldi,Giuliano Iorio,M. Celeste Artale,Michela Mapelli,Volker Springel,Sownak Bose,Lars Hernquist",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"(Edited) We introduce a flexible framework for building gravitational wave (GW) event catalogs in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. Our framework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN with Arepo-GW -- a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo -- to assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in simulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN. Arepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during simulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The algorithm is fully parallel and can be readily adapted to outputs from other simulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we applied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG suite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the resulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving merger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor mass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary with simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated star formation histories and are generally consistent with current observational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\sim 4.5$ excess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger rates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates for $z \lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across different formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the binary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current observational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our novel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a full cosmological context.",
New submissions,Preferential Accretion onto the Secondary Black Hole Strengthens Gravitational Wave Signals,"Julia M. Comerford,Joseph Simon",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Pulsar timing arrays have recently found evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves that are consistent with being produced by a cosmological population of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the amplitude of this gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population, and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves. Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.",
New submissions,Are all Binary Black Holes Detected from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Follow the Universal Time-Delay Distributions? Likely Not,"Samsuzzaman Afroz,Navdha,Suvodip Mukherjee",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The delay time distribution (DTD) of binary black hole (BBH) mergers encodes the evolutionary link between the formation history and gravitational-wave (GW) emission. We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass-dependent DTD using the BBHs from the GWTC-4 that avoids restrictive assumptions of only power-law forms. Our analysis reveals for the first time the signature for mass-dependent evolutionary pathways: lower-mass systems ($20$-$40\,M_\odot$) are consistent with a scale-invariant DTD, whereas higher-mass BBHs ($40$-$100\,M_\odot$) provide the first direct tentative evidence of DTD that deviate from simple power laws, with a pronounced preference for rapid mergers around $2-6$ Gyrs. These findings reveal the advantage of the non-parametric technique in reconstructing the mass-dependent DTD and discovering for the first-time the presence of a potential time-scale associated with high-mass GW events.",
New submissions,Primordial Black Holes and their Mass Spectra: The Effects of Mergers and Accretion within Stasis Cosmologies,"Keith R. Dienes,Lucien Heurtier,Fei Huang,Tim M.P. Tait,Brooks Thomas",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"A variety of processes in the very early universe can give rise to a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with an extended mass spectrum. For certain mass spectra of this sort, it has been shown that the evaporation of these PBHs into radiation can drive the universe toward an epoch of cosmological stasis which can persist for a significant number of $e$-folds of cosmological expansion. However, in general, the initial mass spectrum which characterizes a population of PBHs at the time of production can subsequently be distorted by processes such as mergers and accretion. In this paper, we examine the effects that these processes have on the spectra that lead to a PBH-induced stasis. Within such stasis models, we find that mergers have only a negligible effect on these spectra within the regime of interest for stasis. We likewise find that the effect of accretion is negligible in many cases of interest. However, we find that the effect of accretion on the PBH mass spectrum is non-negligible in situations in which this spectrum is particularly broad. In such situations, the stasis epoch is abridged or, in extreme cases, does not occur at all. Thus accretion plays a non-trivial role in constraining the emergence of stasis within scenarios which lead to extended PBH mass spectra.",
New submissions,Benchmarking AI-evolved cosmological structure formation,"Xiaofeng Dong,Nesar Ramachandra,Salman Habib,Katrin Heitmann",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph),"The potential of deep learning-based image-to-image translations has recently attracted significant attention. One possible application of such a framework is as a fast, approximate alternative to cosmological simulations, which would be particularly useful in various contexts, including covariance studies, investigations of systematics, and cosmological parameter inference. To investigate different aspects of learning-based cosmological mappings, we choose two approaches for generating suitable cosmological matter fields as datasets: a simple analytical prescription provided by the Zel'dovich approximation, and a numerical N-body method using the Particle-Mesh approach. The evolution of structure formation is modeled using U-Net, a widely employed convolutional image translation framework. Because of the lack of a controlled methodology, validation of these learned mappings requires multiple benchmarks beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. A comprehensive list of metrics is considered, including higher-order correlation functions, conservation laws, topological indicators, and statistical independence of density fields. We find that the U-Net approach performs well only for some of these physical metrics, and accuracy is worse at increasingly smaller scales, where the dynamic range in density is large. By introducing a custom density-weighted loss function during training, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the U-Net results at smaller scales. This study provides an example of how a family of physically motivated benchmarks can, in turn, be used to fine-tune optimization schemes -- such as the density-weighted loss used here -- to significantly enhance the accuracy of scientific machine learning approaches by focusing attention on relevant features.",
New submissions,The radial acceleration relation at the EDGE of galaxy formation: testing its universality in low-mass dwarf galaxies,"Mariana P. Júlio,Justin I. Read,Marcel S. Pawlowski,Pengfei Li,Daniel Vaz,Jarle Brinchmann,Martin P. Rey,Oscar Agertz,Tom Holmes",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A tight correlation between the baryonic and observed acceleration of galaxies has been reported over a wide range of mass ($10^8 < M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot < 10^{11}$) - the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR). This has been interpreted as evidence that dark matter is actually a manifestation of some modified weak-field gravity theory. In this paper, we study the radially resolved RAR of 12 nearby dwarf galaxies, with baryonic masses in the range $10^4 < M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot < 10^{7.5}$, using a combination of literature data and data from the MUSE-Faint survey. We use stellar line-of-sight velocities and the Jeans modelling code GravSphere to infer the mass distributions of these galaxies, allowing us to compute the RAR. We compare the results with the EDGE simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies with similar stellar masses in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that most of the observed dwarf galaxies lie systematically above the low-mass extrapolation of the RAR. Each galaxy traces a locus in the RAR space that can have a multi-valued observed acceleration for a given baryonic acceleration, while there is significant scatter from galaxy to galaxy. Our results indicate that the RAR does not apply to low-mass dwarf galaxies and that the inferred baryonic acceleration of these dwarfs does not contain enough information, on its own, to derive the observed acceleration. The simulated EDGE dwarfs behave similarly to the real data, lying systematically above the extrapolated RAR. We show that, in the context of modified weak-field gravity theories, these results cannot be explained by differential tidal forces from the Milky Way, nor by the galaxies being far from dynamical equilibrium, since none of the galaxies in our sample seems to experience strong tides. As such, our results provide further evidence for the need for invisible dark matter in the smallest dwarf galaxies.",
New submissions,CURLING -- II. Improvement on the $H_{0}$ Inference from Pixelized Cluster Strong Lens Modeling,"Yushan Xie,Huanyuan Shan,Yiping Shu,Nan Li,Ji Yao,Ran Li,Xiaoyue Cao,Zizhao He,Yin Li,Eric Jullo,Jean-Paul Kneib,Guoliang Li",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) provide a powerful, independent method to measure the Hubble constant, $H_{0}$, through time delays between their multiple images. The accuracy of this measurement depends critically on both the precision of time delay estimation and the robustness of lens modeling. In many current cluster-scale modeling algorithms, all multiple images used for modeling are simplified as point sources to reduce computational costs. In the first paper of the CURLING program, we demonstrated that such a point-like approximation can introduce significant uncertainties and biases in both magnification reconstruction and cosmological inference. In this study, we explore how such simplifications affect $H_0$ measurements from glSNe. We simulate a lensed supernova at $z=1.95$, lensed by a galaxy cluster at $z=0.336$, assuming time delays are measured from LSST-like light curves. The lens model is constructed using JWST-like imaging data, utilizing both Lenstool and a pixelated method developed in CURLING. Under a fiducial cosmology with $H_0=70\rm \ km \ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$, the Lenstool model yields $H_0=69.91^{+6.27}_{-5.50}\rm \ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$, whereas the pixelated framework improves the precision by over an order of magnitude, $H_0=70.39^{+0.82}_{-0.60}\rm \ km \ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$. Our results indicate that in the next-generation observations (e.g., JWST), uncertainties from lens modeling dominate the error budget for $H_0$ inference, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the extended surface brightness of multiple images to fully leverage the potential of glSNe for cosmology.",
New submissions,Probing the cosmological 21~cm global signal from the Antarctic ice sheet,"Shijie Sun,Jiaqin Xu,Minquan Zhou,Shenzhe Xu,Fengquan Wu,Haoran Zhang,Juyong Zhang,Bin Ma,Zhaohui Shang,Xuelei Chen",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The redshifted 21 cm line, arising from neutral hydrogen, offers a unique probe into the intergalactic medium and the first stars and galaxies formed in the early universe. However, detecting this signal is a challenging task because of artificial radio-frequency interference (RFI) and systematic errors such as ground effects. The interior of the Antarctic continent provides an excellent location to make such observations, with minimal RFI and relatively stable foreground signals. Moreover, a flat plateau in central Antarctica, with an ice cap over 2000 m deep, will show less ground reflection of radio waves, reducing the signal complexity in the area around the probing antenna. It may be advantageous to perform cosmological 21 cm experiments in Antarctica, and a 21 cm Antarctic global spectrum experiment can potentially be deployed on the Antarctic ice cap. We have performed preliminary instrumental design, system calibration, and implementation of such an instrument optimized for extreme cold and capable of long-term autonomous operation. This system shows the ability to effectively detect the 21~cm signal, confirming Antarctica as an excellent observational site for radio cosmology.",
New submissions,High-energy variability of the gravitationally lensed blazar PKS 1830-211,"Sarah M. Wagner,Jeffrey D. Scargle,Greg Madejski,Andrea Gokus,Krzysztof Nalewajko,Patrick Günther,Karl Mannheim",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The production site and process responsible for the highly variable high-energy emission observed from blazar jets are still debated. Gravitational lenses can be used as microscopes to investigate the nature of such sources. We study the broad-band spectral properties and the high-energy variability of the gravitationally-lensed blazar PKS 1830-211, for which radio observations have revealed two images, to put constraints on the jet physics and the existence of a gravitationally-induced time delay and magnification ratio between the images. We utilize Swift/XRT, Nustar, and Fermi-LAT observations from 2016 and 2019 to compare periods of low activity and high activity in PKS 1830-211. Short-timescale variability is elucidated with an unbinned power spectrum analysis of time-tagged NuSTAR photon data. To study the gravitationally-induced time delay in the gamma-ray light curve observed with Fermi-LAT, we improve existing autocorrelation function based methods. Our modified auto-correlation method yields a delay of t_0=21.1 +/- 0.1 d and magnification factor a=0.13 +/- 0.01. These parameters remain time-invariant. In data from 2016 and 2019, the X-ray spectra remain remarkably stable, contrasting with extreme changes in gamma-rays. Both states can be fitted with a single component from Comptonisation of infrared emission from the dusty torus, with different gamma-ray states arising solely from a shift in the break of the electron energy distribution. The detection of a consistent lag throughout the whole light curve suggests that they originate from a persistent location in the jet.",
New submissions,"The cosmic web's Lyman-$α$ glow at $z \approx 2.5$; varying hydrodynamic models, dust, and wide-field, narrow-band imaging detection","Oleksii Sokoliuk,John K. Webb,Kenneth M. Lanzetta,Michael M. Shara,Stefan Gromoll,James S. Bolton,Robert F. Carswell,Gaspar Galaz,Cédric Ledoux,Gaspare Lo Curto,Alain Smette,David Valls-Gabaud,Anja von der Linden,Frederick M. Walter,Joris Witstok",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The diffuse glow of the cosmic web in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission has long been predicted, yet remained elusive to direct wide field detection. We present theoretical calculations that, when compared with recent observations made using the Condor Array Telescope in New Mexico reported in Lanzetta et al. 2024, point to its discovery at $z \approx 2.5$. Synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness maps are constructed from five state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris-TNG, SIMBA, EAGLE, CROCODILE, and Sherwood), incorporating dust attenuation, star formation, collisional excitation, and recombination physics. Our cosmic web Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness predictions are consistent with the UV excess detected at high significance in the recent deep, wide field, narrow-band imaging Condor data. The calculations presented here thus demonstrate that diffuse Lyman-$\alpha$ emission is observable with current (and next-generation) wide field low surface brightness facilities, opening the path to direct cartographic mapping of the cosmic web. These findings mark a turning point: for the first time, cosmology moves beyond inference from absorption and high-density peaks, into panoramic imaging of the faint intergalactic scaffolding that underpins structure formation in the Universe.",
New submissions,Probing evolution of Long GRB properties through their cosmic formation history aided by Machine Learning predicted redshifts,"Dhruv S. Bal,Aditya Narendra,Maria Giovanna Dainotti,Nikita S. Khatiya,Aleksander L. Lenart,Dieter H. Hartmann",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are valuable probes of cosmic star formation reaching back into the epoch of reionization, and a large dataset with known redshifts ($z$) is an important ingredient for these studies. Usually, $z$ is measured using spectroscopy or photometry, but $\sim80\%$ of GRBs lack such data. Prompt and afterglow correlations can provide estimates in these cases, though they suffer from systematic uncertainties due to assumed cosmologies and due to detector threshold limits. We use a sample with $z$ estimated via machine learning models, based on prompt and afterglow parameters, without relying on cosmological assumptions. We then use an augmented sample of GRBs with measured and predicted redshifts, forming a larger dataset. We find that the predicted redshifts are a crucial step forward in understanding the evolution of GRB properties. We test three cases: no evolution, an evolution of the beaming factor, and an evolution of all terms captured by an evolution factor $(1+z)^\delta$. We find that these cases can explain the density rate in the redshift range between 1-2, but neither of the cases can explain the derived rate densities at smaller and higher redshifts, which may point towards an evolution term different than a simple power law. Another possibility is that this mismatch is due to the non-homogeneity of the sample, e.g., a non-collapsar origin of some long GRB within the sample.",
Cross submissions,Rolling with modular symmetry: quintessence and de Sitter in heterotic orbifolds,"Hansel Gordillo-Ruiz,Miguel Hernandez-Segura,Ignacio Portillo-Castillo,Saul Ramos-Sanchez,Ivonne Zavala",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Modular invariance is a fundamental symmetry in string compactifications, constraining both the structure of the effective theory and the dynamics of moduli and matter fields. It has also gained renewed importance in the context of swampland conjectures and, independently, flavour physics. We investigate a modular-invariant scalar potential arising from heterotic orbifolds, where the flavour structure and moduli dynamics are jointly shaped by the underlying geometry. Focusing on a string-inspired, two-moduli truncation, we uncover a rich vacuum structure featuring anti-de Sitter minima and unstable de Sitter saddle points. We identify large regions in moduli space supporting multifield hilltop quintessence consistent with observations. All solutions satisfy refined swampland de Sitter bounds. Our results illustrate how modular symmetry can guide the construction of controlled, string-motivated quintessence scenarios within consistent effective theories.",
Cross submissions,"Magnetic Helicity, Magnetic Monopoles, and Higgs Winding","Hajime Fukuda,Yuta Hamada,Kohei Kamada,Kyohei Mukaida,Fumio Uchida",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Changes in magnetic helicity are often discussed across a variety of fields, from condensed matter physics to early universe cosmology. It is frequently stated that the helicity change is given by the integral of the gauge field strength tensor and its dual over spacetime, $\int F \wedge F$. However, this is incorrect when magnetic monopoles once exist in the spacetime. In this paper, we show the correct formula of the helicity change in such a case for the Maxwell theory with the magnetic monopoles. We also discuss what happens when we embed the Maxwell theory with magnetic monopoles into non-Abelian gauge theories. We show that a similar formula holds for the 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole. In particular, we find the winding numbers and the zeroes of the Higgs field in the non-Abelian gauge theory play a crucial role in the helicity change. The same discussion is also applicable to the electroweak theory, and we discuss the implication of our findings to the baryon number change via the chiral anomaly in the early universe.",
Cross submissions,Unified Dark Matter and Dark Energy in a model of Non-Canonical Scalar-Tensor Theory,"Nihal Jalal Pullisseri,Sanil Unnikrishnan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We consider a model of non-canonical scalar-tensor theory in which the kinetic term in the Brans-Dicke action is replaced by a non-canonical scalar field Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(X, \phi)= \lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta - V(\phi)$ where $X = (1/2) \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial^{\mu} \phi$ and $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\lambda$ are parameters of the model. This can be considered as a simple non-canonical generalization of the Brans-Dicke theory with a potential term which corresponds to a special case of this model with the values of the parameter $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = -1$ and $\lambda = 2w_{_{BD}}$ where $w_{_{BD}}$ is the Brans-Dicke parameter. Considering a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with scale factor $a(t)$, it is shown that, in the matter free Universe, the kinetic term $\lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta$ can lead to a power law solution $a(t)\propto t^{n}$ but the maximum possible value of $n$ turns out to be $(1+\sqrt{3})/4 \approx 0.683$. When $\alpha \geq 18$, this model can lead to a solution $a(t)\propto t^{2/3}$, thereby mimicking the evolution of scale factor in a cold dark matter dominated epoch with Einstein's General Relativity (GR). With the addition of a linear potential term $V(\phi) = V_{0}\phi$, it is shown that this model mimics the standard $\Lambda$CDM model type evolution of the Universe. The larger the value of $\alpha$, the closer the evolution of $a(t)$ in this model to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model based on Einstein's GR. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this model with a linear potential can mimic the GR based $\Lambda$CDM model. However, with an appropriate choice of the potential $V(\phi)$, this model can provide a unified description of both dark matter and dynamical dark energy, as if it were based on Einstein's GR.",
