New submissions,"A Promise for the JWST era: Massive black holes directly collapsed from wave dark matter haloes, and Star formation in and around their accretion flows","Xiaobo Dong,Yongda Zhu,Marcia Rieke,George Rieke,Xinyu Li,Peter Behroozi,Haixia Ma,Runyu Meng,Zhiying Mao,Zhe Sun",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas),"There are several puzzling phenomena from recent JWST observations, which seem to push the standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology over the edge. All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the ""heavy eggs"") formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the ""chickens""). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely ""maximum stable mass"" and ""bosenova"") and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.",
New submissions,Numerical modelling of the lobes of radio galaxies VI. Polarimetric simulations of universal pressure profile cluster atmospheres,"Michael Stimpson,Martin Hardcastle,Martin Krause",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present the results of a polarization study based upon relativistic magnetohydrodynamic modelling of jets running into hydrostatic, spherically symmetric cluster atmospheres. For the first time in a numerical simulation, we derive Faraday rotation measure maps (RM maps) from model cluster atmospheres based upon the universal pressure profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature profile for a 'typical' self-similar atmosphere described by only one parameter: M500. We compare our simulated polarization products with current observational data from Very Large Array (VLA) and LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR), as well as continuing investigations from our previous work, such as the detectability of the Laing Garrington effect. We also studied the variation of mean fractional polarization with cluster mass and jet power. We produce simulated Stokes Q and U channel images and using the Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis technique we create RM maps. These data provide insight into what we should expect of current and future high-resolution polarimetric studies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows as we were able to probe the limitations of the RM synthesis technique by comparing it with the RM map direct from our simulations. Highlights of our study include clear reproduction of polarization enhancements towards the edges of radio lobes for suitable conditions and a demonstration that complex lobe morphologies with multiple emission and Faraday active regions interspersed as might be expected in some pole-on or perhaps precessing sources should be distinguishable in observations with current technology. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster atmosphere, these numerical simulations, and the polarimetric properties derived from them, represent the most realistic yet for spherically symmetric atmospheres.",

Tarlé,B. A. Weaver,R. H. Wechsler,M. White,R. Zhou,H. Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Over several dedicated programs that include targets beyond the main cosmological samples, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collected spectra for 311,102 unique objects in two fields centered on the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. In this work, we develop spectroscopic redshift robustness criteria for those spectra, validate these criteria using visual inspection, and provide two custom Value-Added Catalogs with our redshift characterizations. With these criteria, we reliably classify 217,037 galaxies below z < 1.6, 9,688 quasars and 35,505 stars. As a critical element in characterizing the selection function, we provide the description of 70 different algorithms that were used to select these targets from imaging data. To facilitate joint imaging/spectroscopic analyses, we provide row-matched photometry from the Dark Energy Camera, Hyper-Suprime Cam, and public COSMOS2020 photometric catalogs. Finally, we demonstrate example applications of these large catalogs to photometric redshift estimation, cluster finding, and completeness studies.",
New submissions,Balmer series fluxes from Pop. III Stars: A-SLOTH Predictions for JWST Observability,"Veronika Lipatova,Simon C.O.Glover,Ralf S. Klessen,Boyuan Liu",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Detecting Population III (Pop. III) stars remains a major observational challenge. Their Balmer series recombination line emission, redshifted into the infrared at $z \sim 5-11$, is a potential tracer. JWST/NIRSpec offers the first opportunity to detect such lines, provided fluxes exceed instrumental sensitivity. This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first four Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess their detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \leq z \leq 11$. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting Milky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted fluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop. III H$\alpha$ fluxes peak at $\sim10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, 2-3 orders of magnitude below the JWST detection threshold ($\sim6 \times 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). The fluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H$\alpha$ and hence are also not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing photon escape fraction $f_{\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop. III Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9 to 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in this case, the lines remain undetectable.Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be undetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\mu \gtrsim 10$). A-SLOTH provides a useful tool to predict emission strengths and assess the detectability of Pop. III stars across cosmic history.",
New submissions,Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in the circumgalactic medium -- II: dependence on star formation,"Sanskriti Das,Nhut Truong,Yi-Kuan Chiang,Smita Mathur",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We measure thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) Effect in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of $\approx$2.5 million $\rm M_{200}$=$\rm 10^{12-14}\,M_\odot$ WISE$\times$DESI galaxies out to $z$=1.2. We split the sample into quiescent (0.7 million) and star-forming (1.8 million) galaxies, exploring the relation between the thermal pressure of the CGM and star formation for the first time. We develop and implement a novel probabilistic approach to cross-correlate the galaxy catalog with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope+Planck data by taking into account the uncertainties in redshift, mass, and star formation rate. The S/N of the stacked Compton-$y$ value in the CGM varies from 4.9 to 18.5, depending on the sample size and the CGM signal strength within the relevant mass bin. We detect the CGM signal down to $\rm M_{200}=10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$, and provide stringent upper limit at $\rm M_{200}<10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$. The data fit well with the standard GNFW profile of thermal pressure and do not require a flatter or steeper profile. This suggests a significant impact of cooling and the absence of dominant feedback. In galaxies with $\rm M_{200}\approx10^{12.3-12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the volume filling CGM is likely the largest contributor to the $galactic$ baryons at their virial temperatures of $\sim$10$^{6-6.4}\rm\,K$. For $\rm M_{200}>10^{12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the most massive phase of the CGM is likely at a sub-virial temperature of $\rm\gtrsim 10^6\,K$. The thermal energy of the CGM of quiescent galaxies follows the self-similar relation with mass, but the star-forming galaxies deviate from this relation. This indicates that the impact of non-gravitational factors varies among halos of different degrees of star-forming activity.",
New submissions,Inflationary Models with Gauss-Bonnet Coupling in Light of ACT Observations,"Yigan Zhu,Qing Gao,Yungui Gong,Zhu Yi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent analyses combining Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data with other cosmological datasets report a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, creating tension with a wide range of inflationary models. Since a Gauss-Bonnet term with a coupling function $\xi(\phi) = 3\lambda/[4V(\phi)]$ leaves $n_s$ nearly unchanged (up to a field rescaling) while reducing the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by a factor $(1-\lambda)$, so choosing $(1-\lambda)$ sufficiently small effectively removes $r$ as a limiting observable, making it easier for inflationary models to satisfy the latest observational constraints and alleviating this tension. Applying this mechanism to chaotic inflation, E-models, T-models, and hilltop inflation, we find that broad regions of parameter space become consistent with the latest ACT-based CMB constraints. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet couplings can help bring a broad class of inflationary models into agreement with current CMB measurements.",
New submissions,The cosmological lithium problem,Oswaldo D. Miranda,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance in Spite plateau stars has been attributed either to a challenge to the standard model of nucleosynthesis or to stellar processes occurring after the stars formed. To understand the origin of this discrepancy, it is crucial to link the cosmic star formation rate with a chemical enrichment model that incorporates the yields of both Population (Pop) III and II stars. It is within this framework that the evolution of lithium can be determined. The primary goal is to demonstrate that there is no discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance. By combining a standard chemical evolution model with the hierarchical structure formation scenario, it is possible to determine the lithium abundance as a function of $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. The model's results are compared with observational data, including two extremely iron-poor stars: J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708. The Spite plateau is naturally established in the range $-8.0 \lesssim [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \lesssim -2.0$ with $^{7}\mathrm{Li/H}$ $\sim 1.81 \times 10^{-10}$. We find that J0023+0307 could have formed $\sim 4.4 \times 10^{5} - 1.3 \times 10^{6}$ years after the explosion of the first Pop III star in the Universe, whereas for SMSS J0313-6708 this event would have occurred $\sim 2.2 \times 10^{5} - 4.4 \times 10^{5}$ years later. The Spite plateau serves as an observational signature of the formation of Pop III stars. The abundances observed in J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708 are consistent with Pop III progenitor stars in the mass range $10-100 M_{\odot}$. However, if some high-redshift star formation occurs within subhalo-like structures, the contribution of stars in the mass range $140-260 M_{\odot}$ to the formation of the extended Spite plateau cannot be ruled out.",
New submissions,Powerful Radio Sources as Probes of Black Hole Physics,Ruth A. Daly,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Powerful jetted radio sources for which the luminosity in directed kinetic energy has been empirically determined, independent of assumptions, are considered. The total outflow lifetime of each source determined in the context of detailed cosmological studies was found to depend only upon the luminosity in directed kinetic energy ($L$). The distributions of $L$, total outflow lifetime, and total outflow energy each have a broad range of values, as do the supermassive black hole masses. The total outflow energy relative to the black hole mass is a small number with a small dispersion. Three explanations of these remarkable results are considered. This could indicate (1) the efficiencies with which black hole irreducible mass is increased and spin mass energy is extracted during the outflow event, (2) that the merger of two supermassive black holes occurs over a timescale commensurate with the independently determined outflow lifetime and that these mergers lead to the production of the low-frequency gravitational wave background, or (3) that feedback shuts off black hole accretion due to energy injected into the ambient medium.",
New submissions,Stochastic Inflation with Interacting Noises,"Amin Nassiri-Rad,Haidar Sheikhahmadi,Hassan Firouzjahi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Stochastic $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful tool to calculate the cosmological correlators non-perturbatively. However, it requires the initial data for the amplitude of the noise on the initial flat hypersurface which for a free theory during inflation is fixed to be $\frac{H}{2 \pi}$. In this work, we study the setups where the underlying theory involves interactions and the stochastic noises inherit these interactions. We extend the stochastic $\delta N$ formalism to these setups and rewrite the corresponding Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations in which the QFT corrections in the amplitude of the noises are taken into account. As an example, in the three-phase SR-USR-SR setup which is employed for PBHs formation, the modification in the amplitude of noise is calculated from the one-loop corrections in power spectrum via in-in formalism. We show that in these setups the amplitude of the stochastic noise is modified to $\frac{H}{2 \pi} \Big(1+ \frac{ \Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{ {\cal R} } }\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ in which $ \frac{\Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{{\cal R} } }$ is the fractional one-loop correction in power spectrum.",
New submissions,GW231123: a Possible Primordial Black Hole Origin,"Valerio De Luca,Gabriele Franciolini,Antonio Riotto",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"GW231123, the heaviest binary black hole merger detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration to date, lies in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits unusually high component spins. In this letter, we show that both merging black holes may have a primordial origin with smaller initial masses. The observed masses and, crucially, the spins of GW231123 are naturally accommodated within the most vanilla primordial black hole framework, once cosmological accretion is taken into account. Interestingly, the parameter space needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the exclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this interpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out. The upcoming O5 observing run by the collaboration should detect ${\cal O}(20)$ similar events, testing their mass-spin correlation, while next-generation detectors would be capable of observing high redshift events, as predicted in this scenario.",
Cross submissions,A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter,"Priyesh Chakraborty,Timothy Cohen,Daniel Green,Yiwen Huang",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational wave distance estimation using intrinsic signal properties: dark sirens as distance indicators,"Trisha V,Rakesh V,Arun Kenath(Christ University, Bangalore)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a powerful means for cosmological distance estimation, circumventing the systematic uncertainties associated with traditional electromagnetic (EM) indicators. This work presents a model for estimating distances to binary black hole (BBH) mergers using only GW data, independent of EM counterparts or galaxy catalogs. By utilizing the intrinsic properties of the GW signal, specifically the strain amplitude and merger frequency, our model offers a computationally efficient preliminary distance estimation approach that could complements existing Bayesian parameter estimation pipelines. In this work, we examine a simplified analytical expression for the GW luminosity distance derived from General Relativity (GR), based on the leading-order quadrupole approximation. Without incorporating post-Newtonian (PN) or numerical relativity (NR) corrections, or modeling spin, eccentricity, or inclination, we test how closely this expression can reproduce distances reported by full Bayesian inference pipelines. We apply our model to 87 events from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogues (GWTC), computing distances for these sources. Our results demonstrate consistent agreement with GWTC-reported distances, further supported by graphical comparisons that highlight the model's performance across multiple events.",
Cross submissions,"Instant Folded Strings, Dark Energy and a Cyclic Bouncing Universe","Nissan Itzhaki,Uri Peleg,Paul J. Steinhardt",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a wholly self-consistent, complete cyclic bouncing cosmology based on components drawn from string theory and constructed in a way that is under perturbative control throughout (e.g., with temperature much less than the string scale and string coupling $g_s \ll 1$ at all times). The cyclic evolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a perturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a second field that becomes massless at $\phi= \phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an enhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the way to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs) - fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the string mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the Null Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string coupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In turn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and initiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition into slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic singularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and robustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of primordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Wave Signatures of $\mathrm{U(1)_X}$ Breaking and Right-Handed Neutrino Dynamics,"Arnab Chaudhuri,Priya Mishra,Rukmani Mohanta",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Standard Model (SM) leaves several fundamental questions unanswered, including the origin of neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, and the nature of dark matter. Motivated by these gaps, we investigate an extension of the SM with an additional local $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry and a complex scalar singlet that spontaneously breaks this symmetry via its vacuum expectation value. The extended framework naturally accommodates three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to ensure anomaly cancellation and implements a type-I seesaw mechanism for active neutrino masses. We perform a detailed numerical analysis demonstrating consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, including predictions for the effective Majorana mass parameter relevant to neutrinoless double beta decay. Furthermore, we estimate the key parameters of the first-order phase transition and compute the resulting stochastic gravitational wave spectrum, demonstrating that it can lie within the reach of forthcoming experiments such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, and the Einstein Telescope. The right-handed neutrinos also open a viable path for thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified link between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and gravitational wave signatures. Our results demonstrate that this minimal $U(1)_X$ scenario remains a promising probe for physics beyond the Standard Model, accessible through upcoming gravitational wave and neutrino experiments.",
Cross submissions,Bubble Trouble: a Review on Electroweak Baryogenesis,"Jorinde van de Vis,Jordy de Vries,Marieke Postma",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"The origin of the universal asymmetry between matter and antimatter remains a mystery. Electroweak baryogenesis is a well-motivated mechanism for generating the asymmetry dynamically, using interesting features of the Standard Model. In addition, it relies on beyond-the-Standard Model physics active around the electroweak scale: new physics coupling to the Higgs to make the electroweak phase transition first order, and a new mechanism of CP violation. The relatively low energy scale at which electroweak baryogenesis occurs makes certain aspects of the mechanism testable through collider experiments, electric dipole moment measurements, and gravitational wave observations. However, scenarios of electroweak baryogenesis are increasingly challenged by results from contemporary experiments. The developing experimental programs will play a crucial role in either falsifying or detecting the new physics responsible for electroweak baryogenesis. To achieve this, it is essential to make precise predictions for the baryon asymmetry and the corresponding experimental signatures within specific scenarios. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the rich physics involved in these predictions. Our goal is to offer a practical computational guide, with a focus on recent developments in the field.",
