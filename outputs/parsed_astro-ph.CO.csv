New submissions,Testing $f(T)$ Gravity with Cosmological Observations: Confronting the Hubble Tension and Implications for the Late-Time Universe,"Saurabh Verma,Archana Dixit,Anirudh Pradhan,M. S. Barak",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In recent years, modifications to General Relativity (GR) have been explored to address cosmological observations, particularly in the context of late-time cosmic acceleration. Among these, modifications based on the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), particularly $f(T)$ gravity, have gained significant attention. In this work, we investigate the scalar perturbations in $f(T)$ gravity, focusing on how these perturbations modify the Poisson and lensing equations and how they impact cosmological observables. By incorporating observational data from cosmic chromatometers, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the DESI BAO survey, and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), we derive constraints on the parameters of the $f(T)$ power-law model. Our results suggest that $f(T)$ gravity can effectively alleviate some of the tensions observed in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including the Hubble constant ($H_0$) discrepancy. Furthermore, the evolution of the supernova luminosity and its dependence on the gravitational constant are considered to refine the measurement of cosmological parameters. The model's ability to address the $H_0$ tension is critically examined, and we find that $f(T)$ gravity offers a viable alternative to the standard model. The work concludes by comparing the fits of the $f(T)$ gravity model to the $\Lambda$CDM model using various information criteria, revealing key insights into the viability of modified gravity in contemporary cosmology.",
New submissions,The First RELHIC? Cloud-9 is a Starless Gas Cloud,"Gagandeep S. Anand,Alejandro Benítez-Llambay,Rachael Beaton,Andrew J. Fox,Julio F. Navarro,Elena D'Onghia",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"FAST observations have recently identified a compact HI cloud (hereafter Cloud-9) in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M94. This identification has been confirmed independently by VLA and GBT observations. Cloud-9 has the same recession velocity as M94, and is therefore at a similar distance ($\sim$4.4 Mpc). It is compact ($\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold ($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\sim 10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$. Here we present deep HST/ACS imaging designed to search for a luminous stellar counterpart. We visually rule out the presence of any dwarf galaxy with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{3.5}$$M_{\odot}$. A more robust color-magnitude diagram-based analysis rules out a 10$^{4}$$M_{\odot}$ stellar counterpart with 99.5$\%$ confidence. The non-detection of a luminous component reinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI Cloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make Cloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud. This provides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model, namely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on sub-galactic mass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy formation.",
New submissions,A Tale of Tails: Star Formation and Stripping in Jellyfish Galaxies in the Strong Lensing Cluster MACS J0138.0-2155,"Catherine C. Gibson,Jackson H. O'Donnell,Tesla E. Jeltema",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the effects of ram-pressure stripping on four galaxies within the massive, strong-lensing cluster MACS-J0138.0-2155 ($z=0.336$). Of these, three are classified as jellyfish galaxies, with significant elongated tails. Two of these jellyfish galaxies, J1 and J2, are in a late-stage of stripping and show post-starburst features within their disk regions with star formation only in the tails. Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopic data, we spatially resolve the stellar and gas kinematics to examine extraplanar gas associated with ram-pressure stripping. We complement this analysis with optical and near-infrared imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to visualize the galactic structure of each member. The jellyfish galaxies are all blue-shifted with respect to the cluster and show velocity gradients of a few hundred $\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ across their tails. From the resolved gas kinematics, we derive H$\alpha$-based star formation rates; these are generally low reaching a maximum of approximately 0.49 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}kpc^{-2}}$ in galaxy J3. We also report the kinematics for galaxy J4, which lies in the foreground of the cluster but close in projection to one of the lensed arcs.",
New submissions,A Constraint on Dark Matter Self-Interaction from Combined Strong Lensing and Stellar Kinematics in MACS J0138-2155,"Jackson H. O'Donnell(1 and 2),Tesla E. Jeltema(1 and 2),M. Grant Roberts(1 and 2),James Nightingale(3),Abigail Flowers(4),Dhruv Aldas(5) ((1) Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Cruz, (2) Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, (3) School of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, Newcastle University, (4) Department of Physics, University of Zürich, (5) Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) represents a compelling alternative to collisionless dark matter, with diverse phenomenological signals from dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster scales. We present new constraints on the SIDM cross section from the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155, host to the strongly lensed supernovae Requiem and Encore. Our analysis combines strong gravitational lensing with spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the central galaxy, employing several methodological advances over previous cluster-scale SIDM studies. The result is a self-consistent measurement of the density profile of MACS J0138-2155 across two orders of magnitude in radius. Our lensing and kinematics analyses individually yield highly consistent results, and from their combination we report a 95% confidence upper limit on the SIDM cross section of $\sigma/m < 0.613$ cm$^2$/g, at an interaction velocity of $\langle v_\text{pair}\rangle < 2090$ km/s. This constraint, derived from the most detailed single-system analysis to date, is competitive with previous cluster-scale limits while demonstrating the power of combining complementary gravitational probes. The methodology developed here advances precision cluster lens modeling and will inform future studies of dark matter physics, as well as time-delay cosmography in this unique strong lensing system. Additionally, our results imply SN Requiem will reappear sooner than previously reported, with a 1$\sigma$ CL between January 2027 and November 2028 at H$_0 = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.",
New submissions,The structure of the giant radio fossil in the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster,"Simona Giacintucci,Maxim Markevitch,Tracy Clarke,Daniel R. Wik",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present high-sensitivity follow-up observations of the giant fossil radio lobe in the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in the 125-250 MHz and 300-500 MHz frequency bands. The new data have sufficient angular resolution to exclude compact sources and enable us to trace the faint extended emission from the relic lobe to a remarkable distance of 820 kpc from the cluster center. The new images reveal intricate spatial structure within the fossil lobe, including narrow (5-10 kpc), long (70-100 kpc) radio filaments embedded within the diffuse emission at the bottom of the lobe. The filaments exhibit a very steep spectrum ($S_\nu\propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \sim 3$), significantly steeper than the ambient synchrotron emission from the lobe ($\alpha \sim 1.5-2$); they mostly disappear in recently-published MeerKAT images at 1.28 GHz. Their origin is unclear; similar features observed in some other radio lobes typically have a spectrum flatter than that of their ambient medium. These radio filaments may trace regions where the magnetic field has been stretched and amplified by gas circulation within the rising bubble. The spectrum of the brightest region of the radio lobe exhibits a spectral break, which corresponds to a radiative cooling age of the fossil lobe of approximately 174 Myr, giving a date for this most powerful AGN explosion.",
New submissions,"Combined dark matter search towards dwarf spheroidal galaxies with Fermi-LAT, HAWC, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS",Fermi-LAT Collaboration,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are excellent targets for indirect dark matter (DM) searches using gamma-ray telescopes because they are thought to have high DM content and a low astrophysical background. The sensitivity of these searches is improved by combining the observations of dSphs made by different gamma-ray telescopes. We present the results of a combined search by the most sensitive currently operating gamma-ray telescopes, namely: the satellite-borne Fermi-LAT telescope; the ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope arrays H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS; and the HAWC water Cherenkov detector. Individual datasets were analyzed using a common statistical approach. Results were subsequently combined via a global joint likelihood analysis. We obtain constraints on the velocity-weighted cross section $\langle \sigma \mathit{v} \rangle$ for DM self-annihilation as a function of the DM particle mass. This five-instrument combination allows the derivation of up to 2-3 times more constraining upper limits on $\langle \sigma \mathit{v} \rangle$ than the individual results over a wide mass range spanning from 5 GeV to 100 TeV. Depending on the DM content modeling, the 95% confidence level observed limits reach $1.5\times$10$^{-24}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$ and $3.2\times$10$^{-25}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$, respectively, in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ annihilation channel for a DM mass of 2 TeV.",
New submissions,Optimized Observation Sequencing in Low-Earth Orbit with the SPHEREx Survey Planning Software,"Sean Bryan,James Bock,Thomas Burk,Tzu-Ching Chang,Brendan P. Crill,Ari Cukierman,Olivier Dore,C. Darren Dowell,Gregory Dubois-Felsmann,Beth Fabinsky,Sergi Hildebrandt-Rafels,Howard Hui,Kyle Hughes,Phillip Korngut,Philip Mauskopf,Julian Mena,Chi Nguyen,Milad Pourrahmani,Dustin Putnam,Keshav Ramanathan,Flora Ridenhour,Cody Roberson,Amy Trangsrud,Stephen Unwin,Pao-Yu Wang, theSPHEREx Team",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"SPHEREx is a NASA infrared astronomy mission that launched on March 12th, 2025 and is operating successfully in low-Earth orbit (LEO). The mission is currently observing the entire sky in 102 spectral channels in four independent all-sky surveys and also achieves enhanced coverage in two deep fields. This data will resolve key science questions about the early universe, galaxy formation, and the origin of water and biogenic molecules. In this paper, we describe the survey planning software (SPS) that enables SPHEREx to observe efficiently while mitigating a range of operational challenges in LEO. Our optimal target selection algorithm achieves the required high coverage in both the All-Sky and Deep Surveys. The algorithm plans observations to stay within our time-varying allowable pointing zone, interleaves required data downlink passes, and mitigates outages due to the South Atlantic Anomaly and other events. As demonstrated by the sky coverage achieved in the first SPHEREx public data release, our approach is performing well in flight. The SPHEREx SPS is a key new capability that enables the mission to deliver groundbreaking science from LEO.",
New submissions,Galaxy Group Spin Alignment with Cosmic Filament in the TNG Simulation,"Wei Wang,Peng Wang,Yu Rong,Hao-da Wang,Xiao-xiao Tang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We investigate the alignment between the spin vectors of galaxy groups and the axes of their nearest cosmic filaments using the TNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. By systematically analyzing a large sample of groups, we find a robust perpendicular alignment between group spin and filament orientation. Among all examined properties, only group mass and the distance to the nearest filament significantly affect the strength of this alignment: more massive groups and those closer to filaments exhibit a stronger perpendicular signal. In contrast, the alignment is largely insensitive to group richness, the stellar mass threshold used to select member galaxies, and redshift. We further quantify the bias introduced by using member galaxies as tracers of group spin, finding a typical misalignment angle of $\sim38^\circ$ between the spin measured from all dark matter particles and that inferred from member galaxies, independent of group richness or stellar mass cut. Our results provide a clear theoretical benchmark for interpreting observational measurements of spin-filament alignment and highlight the importance of considering group mass and environment. These findings help clarify the main factors influencing spin-filament alignment and provide useful context for future observational and theoretical studies of angular momentum in the cosmic web.",
New submissions,Forecasting 21-cm power spectrum sensitivity to dark Matter-baryon scattering,"Aryan Rahimieh,Priyank Parashari,Vera Gluscevic",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We explore the potential of upcoming 21-cm interferometric observations to probe interacting dark matter (IDM). We focus on scenarios where the dark matter-baryon scattering cross-section scales as $\sigma(v) =\sigma_{0} v^n$, with $\sigma_{0}$ being the normalization constant, $v$ the relative velocity between dark matter and baryons, and $n$ characterizing the velocity dependence. Specifically, we emphasize two cases: Coulomb-like interaction ($n = -4$) and velocity-independent interaction ($n = 0$). Using detailed simulations of the 21-cm power spectrum and the Fisher matrix formalism, we forecast the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which targets the frequency range 50-225 MHz, to both IDM and astrophysical parameters. We marginalize over key astrophysical uncertainties, including star formation efficiency, ionizing photon escape fraction, and X-ray luminosity. Our results demonstrate that 21-cm power spectrum measurements can significantly improve sensitivity to IDM cross-section, with at least a factor of five improvement over global signal forecasts for the $n=0$ case, and more than an order of magnitude enhancement for the $n=-4$ scenario. These forecasts also significantly improve upon the existing bounds from cosmic microwave background and Milky Way satellite abundance observations. Our analysis also shows that the IDM cross-section exhibits no correlation with the parameters associated with star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction of Population-II stars. However, we find that the Coulomb-like cross-section is positively correlated with X-ray luminosity. Our results highlight the critical role of accounting for astrophysical uncertainties in obtaining robust inferences of dark matter-baryon interactions from future 21-cm power spectrum observations.",
New submissions,Boost operator approach to the relativistic SZ effect,"Jens Chluba,Erik Rosenberg",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect provides a powerful cosmological probe. We demonstrate that the corresponding relativistic SZ signal can be accurately calculated using the recently developed boost operator approach. We obtain formally exact expressions for the required differential operator that can be used to generate relativistic temperature and velocity correction functions to any order. Many of the otherwise cumbersome intermediate steps can be avoided and the required boost operator elements can be quickly generated using recurrence relations of the underlying aberration kernel. We confirm previous analytic expressions describing the relativistic SZ effect and give new expressions at third order in the cluster's peculiar velocity, demonstrating the feasibility of the boost operator method. Our derivation also highlights general properties of the boost operator and showcases its application to radiative transfer problems of broader interest.",
New submissions,HSTPROMO Internal Proper Motion Kinematics of Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies: II. Velocity Anisotropy and Dark Matter Cusp Slope of Sculptor,"Eduardo Vitral,Roeland P. van der Marel,Sangmo Tony Sohn,Jorge Peñarrubia,Ekta Patel,Laura L. Watkins,Mattia Libralato,Kevin McKinnon,Andrea Bellini,Paul Bennet",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We analyze three epochs of HST imaging over 20 years for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, measuring precise proper motions for 119 stars and combining them with 1760 existing line-of-sight velocities. This catalog yields the first radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild oblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching $\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in this series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy due to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical symmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of dark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain the inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity moments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree models from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on) configurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons ($i = 57.1$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark matter density slope of $\Gamma_{\rm dark} = 0.29^{+0.31}_{-0.41}$ within the radial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with $\Gamma_{\rm dark} \leq -1$ at 99.8% confidence. This confidence increases for lower inclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations. The results qualitatively agree with $\Lambda$CDM, SIDM, and Fuzzy DM scenarios that predict core formation, while our specific measurements provide quantitative constraints on the prescriptions of feedback, cross sections, or particle masses required by these models, respectively.",
New submissions,Solar peculiar motion inferred from dipole anisotropy in redshift distribution of quasars appears to lie along the Galactic Centre direction,Ashok K. Singal,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"According to the Cosmological Principle an observer stationary with respect to the comoving coordinates of the expanding universe should find the redshift distribution of distant quasars to be isotropic. However, the observed redshift distribution in a large sample of 1.3 million quasars shows a significant dipole anisotropy. A peculiar motion of the observer could introduce such a dipole anisotropy in the observed redshift distribution. However, the motion inferred therefrom turns out to be not only many times the peculiar motion estimated from the anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), but also nearly in a direction at a right angle. The Solar peculiar motion, in fact, turns out to be, quite unexpectedly, in the direction of the Galactic Centre. Such a statistically significant discrepancy in peculiar motion, derived by different methodologies, could imply a violation of the cosmological principle, a cornerstone in the foundation of the standard model.",
New submissions,Euclid preparation. LXXIV. Euclidised observations of Hubble Frontier Fields and CLASH galaxy clusters,Euclid Collaboration,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present HST2EUCLID, a novel Python code to generate Euclid realistic mock images in the $H_{\rm E}$, $J_{\rm E}$, $Y_{\rm E}$, and $I_{\rm E}$ photometric bands based on panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope observations. The software was used to create a simulated database of Euclid images for the 27 galaxy clusters observed during the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) and the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program. Since the mock images were generated from real observations, they incorporate, by construction, all the complexity of the observed galaxy clusters. The simulated Euclid data of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1$-$2403 were then used to explore the possibility of developing strong lensing models based on the Euclid data. In this context, complementary photometric or spectroscopic follow-up campaigns are required to measure the redshifts of multiple images and cluster member galaxies. By Euclidising six parallel blank fields obtained during the HFF program, we provide an estimate of the number of galaxies detectable in Euclid images per ${\rm deg}^2$ per magnitude bin (number counts) and the distribution of the galaxy sizes. Finally, we present a preview of the Chandra Deep Field South that will be observed during the Euclid Deep Survey and two examples of galaxy-scale strong lensing systems residing in regions of the sky covered by the Euclid Wide Survey. The methodology developed in this work lends itself to several additional applications, as simulated Euclid fields based on HST (or JWST) imaging with extensive spectroscopic information can be used to validate the feasibility of legacy science cases or to train deep learning techniques in advance, thus preparing for a timely exploitation of the Euclid Survey data.",
New submissions,Improved photometric redshift estimations through self-organising map-based data augmentation,"Yun-Hao Zhang,Joe Zuntz,Irene Moskowitz,Eric Gawiser,Konrad Kuijken,Marika Asgari,Henk Hoekstra,Alex I. Malz,Ziang Yan,Tianqing Zhang, TheLSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We introduce a framework for the enhanced estimation of photometric redshifts using Self-Organising Maps (SOMs). Our method projects galaxy Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) onto a two-dimensional map, identifying regions that are sparsely sampled by existing spectroscopic observations. These under-sampled areas are then augmented with simulated galaxies, yielding a more representative spectroscopic training dataset. To assess the efficacy of this SOM-based data augmentation in the context of the forthcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we employ mock galaxy catalogues from the OpenUniverse2024 project and generate synthetic datasets that mimic the expected photometric selections of LSST after one (Y1) and ten (Y10) years of observation. We construct 501 degraded realisations by sampling galaxy colours, magnitudes, redshifts and spectroscopic success rates, in order to emulate the compilation of a wide array of realistic spectroscopic surveys. Augmenting the degraded mock datasets with simulated galaxies from the independent CosmoDC2 catalogues has markedly improved the performance of our photometric redshift estimates compared to models lacking this augmentation, particularly for high-redshift galaxies ($z_\mathrm{true} \gtrsim 1.5$). This improvement is manifested in notably reduced systematic biases and a decrease in catastrophic failures by up to approximately a factor of 2, along with a reduction in information loss in the conditional density estimations. These results underscore the effectiveness of SOM-based augmentation in refining photometric redshift estimation, thereby enabling more robust analyses in cosmology and astrophysics for the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory.",
New submissions,Clustering of DESI galaxies split by thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect,"M. Rashkovetskyi,D. J. Eisenstein,J. Aguilar,S. Ahlen,A. Anand,D. Bianchi,D. Brooks,F. J. Castander,T.

Sanchez,D. Schlegel,M. Schubnell,J. Silber,D. Sprayberry,G. Tarlé,B. A. Weaver,R. Zhou,H. Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect is associated with galaxy clusters - extremely large and dense structures tracing the dark matter with a higher bias than isolated galaxies. We propose to use the tSZ data to separate galaxies from redshift surveys into distinct subpopulations corresponding to different densities and biases independently of the redshift survey systematics. Leveraging the information from different environments, as in density-split and density-marked clustering, is known to tighten the constraints on cosmological parameters, like $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and neutrino mass. We use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in their region of overlap to demonstrate informative tSZ splitting of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We discover a significant increase in the large-scale clustering of DESI LRGs corresponding to detections starting from 1-2 sigma in the ACT DR6 + Planck tSZ Compton-$y$ map, below the cluster candidate threshold (4 sigma). We also find that such galaxies have higher line-of-sight coordinate (and velocity) dispersions and a higher number of close neighbors than both the full sample and near-zero tSZ regions. We produce simple simulations of tSZ maps that are intrinsically consistent with galaxy catalogs and do not include systematic effects, and find a similar pattern of large-scale clustering enhancement with tSZ effect significance. Moreover, we observe that this relative bias pattern remains largely unchanged with variations in the galaxy-halo connection model in our simulations. This is promising for future cosmological inference from tSZ-split clustering with semi-analytical models. Thus, we demonstrate that valuable cosmological information is present in the lower signal-to-noise regions of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map, extending far beyond the individual cluster candidates.",
New submissions,Cosmo-Learn: code for learning cosmology using different methods and mock data,"Reginald Christian Bernardo,Daniela Grandón,Jackson Levi Said,Víctor H. Cárdenas,Gene Carlo Belinario,Reinabelle Reyes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present cosmo_learn, an open-source python-based software package designed to simulate cosmological data and perform data-driven inference using a range of modern statistical and machine learning techniques. Motivated by the growing complexity of cosmological models and the emergence of observational tensions, cosmo_learn provides a standardized and flexible framework for benchmarking cosmological inference methods. The package supports realistic noise modeling for key observables in the late Universe, including cosmic chronometers, supernovae Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and gravitational wave bright sirens. We demonstrate the internal consistency of the simulated data with the input cosmology via residuals and parameter recovery using a fiducial $w$CDM model. Built-in learning and inference modules include traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, as well as more recent approaches such as genetic algorithms, Gaussian processes, Bayesian ridge regression, and artificial neural networks. These methods are implemented in a modular and extensible architecture designed to facilitate comparisons across inference strategies in a common pipeline. By providing a flexible and transparent simulation and learning environment, cosmo_learn supports both educational and research efforts at the intersection of cosmology, statistics, and machine learning.",
New submissions,Dark Forces Gathering,"Peter W. Graham,Daniel Green,Joel Meyers",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) show some tension with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For one, the cosmological parameters determined by the CMB are at odds with the expansion history determined by latest BAO measurements. In addition, the combined data has placed uncomfortably strong constraints on neutrino mass. Both effects can be interpreted as negative neutrino mass, one describing the change to the expansion history and the other one describing enhanced lensing. In this paper, we show the current tensions can be solved with a single change either to the lensing of the CMB or the expansion of the universe. We show additional lensing could arise from a variety of models with new light fields. However, these models rarely give the same signal in temperature and polarization, giving a concrete test of the scenario. Alternatively, dark sector models can explain the changes to the expansion by changing the evolution of the matter density. These models introduce new forces, giving rise to long range signals in the three-point statistics of galaxies. We discuss a range of other examples which all illustrate the pattern that additional signals should appear if these tensions are explained by beyond the Standard Model physics.",
New submissions,Constraints on Logarithmic Model Extensions of Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity,"Purnendu Karmakar,Sandeep Haridasu,Atsushi Nishizawa",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We address various cosmological phenomenologies in the symmetric teleparallel framework both in background and perturbation such as cosmic expansion, gravitational coupling constant, gravitational waves propagation. Focusing on logarithmic extensions of $f(Q)$ models, we performed Bayesian analysis using the most-recent cosmological data, DESI DR2, Pantheon+. We also utilized a compilation of redshift space distortions ($f \sigma_8$) dataset to constrain the growth of structures in each of the models modulated by the effective gravitational coupling. We find that our extended Logarithmic $f(Q)$ models are well-constrained by the current cosmological data and are able to describe the late-time cosmic acceleration. The inverse Logarithmic model we introduce is also able to accommodate a phantom-like dark energy equation of state at late times, which is consistent with the recent DESI DR2 observations. We report explicitly predictions for the effective gravitational coupling ($\mu$), and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave ($\nu$) solely based on the background data, which can be tested against future observations. While the two Log-based extensions we have introduced here perform equivalently on the background level, they provide contrasting predictions for the evolution of effective Gravitational constant and propagation of gravitational waves, which should be constrained against the future perturbation data.",
New submissions,Rapid late-time reionization: constraints and cosmological implications,Willem Elbers,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present constraints on the reionization optical depth, $\tau$, obtained using several independent methods. First, we perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the reionization history, using Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints on the evolution of the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction, $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$, including recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope. When combined with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI and Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints, these data imply a rapid reionization history ($z_\mathrm{mid}=7.00^{+0.12}_{-0.18}$ and $\Delta z_{50}=1.12^{+0.12}_{-0.29}$) and a value of $\tau=0.0492^{+0.0014}_{-0.0030}$, which is largely insensitive to the assumed cosmological model and independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The optical depth can also be measured from large-scale $(\ell<30)$ CMB polarization data, yielding constraints that are similarly model-insensitive and consistent with the Ly$\alpha$ bound. Third, $\tau$ may be constrained from the attenuation of small-scale $(\ell>30)$ CMB anisotropies, but the results are sensitive to the choice of cosmological model. Assuming $\Lambda$CDM and combining small-scale CMB data with CMB lensing and type 1a supernovae (SNe) yields tight constraints that are compatible with the Ly$\alpha$ bound. Adding galaxy clustering and lensing measurements brings the constraints further into agreement with the Ly$\alpha$ bound. These independent results reinforce a consensus picture in which reionization is rapid and late. However, the combination of small-scale CMB, CMB lensing, and BAO data yields $\tau=0.094\pm0.011$, which is in $4\sigma$ tension with our Ly$\alpha$ bound. Non-standard reionization scenarios can reconcile some but not all constraints. Concordance is restored in alternative cosmological models, such as models with dynamical dark energy favoured by BAO, CMB, and SNe data.",
Cross submissions,$F$-term Multi-Field Inflation in Supergravity without Stabiliser Superfields,"Jinn-Ouk Gong,Sergei V. Ketov,Takahiro Terada",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Realising $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to the well-known $\eta$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the Kähler potential, but this often leads to a negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic instabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens the theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity.",
Cross submissions,Post-Reheating Inflaton Production as a Probe of Reheating Dynamics,"Kunio Kaneta,Tomo Takahashi,Natsumi Watanabe",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Cosmological reheating bridges the inflationary epoch and the hot big bang phase, yet its underlying dynamics remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate a minimal scenario in which the inflaton evolves under a simple power-law potential during reheating and interacts with other particles via renormalizable couplings. We show that inflaton quanta can be regenerated from the thermal bath even after the decay of the coherent inflaton field, unveiling a previously overlooked channel for inflaton particle production, which offers a novel window into probing reheating. Remarkably, this mechanism may also account for the observed dark matter abundance, providing a natural link between early Universe dynamics and present-day cosmological observations.",

These proceedings compile contributions from the workshop and update the progress of mineral detector research. MD$\nu$DM'25 was the third such meeting, following the first in October of 2022 held at the IFPU in Trieste, Italy and the second in January of 2024 hosted by the Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech in Arlington, USA. Mineral detectors record and retain damage induced by nuclear recoils in synthetic or natural mineral samples. The damage features can then be read out by a variety of nano- and micro-scale imaging techniques. Applications of mineral detectors on timescales relevant for laboratory experiments include reactor neutrino monitoring and dark matter detection, with the potential to measure the directions as well as the energies of the induced nuclear recoils. For natural mineral detectors which record nuclear recoils over geological timescales, reading out even small mineral samples could be sensitive to rare interactions induced by astrophysical neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and heavy exotic particles. A series of mineral detectors of different ages could measure the time evolution of these fluxes, offering a unique window into the history of our solar system and the Milky Way. Mineral detector research is highly multidisciplinary, incorporating aspects of high energy physics, condensed matter physics, materials science, geoscience, and AI/ML for data analysis. Although realizing the scientific potential of mineral detectors poses many challenges, the MD$\nu$DM community looks forward to the continued development of mineral detector experiments and the possible discoveries that mineral detectors could reveal.",
Cross submissions,Incorporating curved geometry in cosmological simulations,"Julian Adamek,Renan Boschetti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Spatial curvature is one of the fundamental cosmological parameters that is routinely constrained from observations. The forward modelling of observations, in particular of large-scale structure, often relies on large cosmological simulations. While the so-called separate universe approach allows one to account for the effect of curvature on the expansion rate in small sub-volumes, the non-Euclidean geometry is harder to accommodate. It becomes important when observables are computed over large distances, e.g. when photons travel to us from high redshift. Here we present a fully relativistic framework to run cosmological simulations for curved spatial geometry. The issue of consistent boundary conditions is solved by embedding a spherical cap of the curved spacetime into a hole within a flat exterior, where it can undergo free expansion. The geometric nature of gravity is made explicit in our framework, allowing for a consistent forward modelling of observables inside the curved patch. Our methodology would also work with any Newtonian code to a good approximation, requiring changes only to the initial conditions and post-processing.",
Cross submissions,Challenging $Λ$CDM with Higher-Order GUP Corrections,"Andronikos Paliathanasis,Genly Leon,Yoelsy Leyva,Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano,Amare Abebe",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study quantum corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM model model arising from a minimum measurable length in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We focus on a higher-order Generalized Uncertainty Principle, beyond the quadratic form. This generalized GUP introduces two free parameters, and we determine the modified Friedmann equation. This framework leads to a perturbative cosmological model that naturally reduces to $\Lambda$CDM in an appropriate limiting case of the deformation parameters. We construct the modified cosmological scenario, analyze its deviations from the standard case, and examine it as a mechanism for the description of dynamical dark energy. To constrain the model, we employ Cosmic Chronometers, the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI DR2 release, and Supernova data from the PantheonPlus and Union3 catalogues. Our analysis indicates that the modified GUP model is statistically competitive with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, providing comparable or even improved fits to some of the combined datasets. Moreover, the data constrain the deformation parameter of the GUP model, with the preferred value found to be negative, which corresponds to a phantom regime in the effective dynamical dark energy description.",
Cross submissions,"Upper Limits on the Isotropic Gravitational-Wave Background from the first part of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA's fourth Observing Run","TheLIGO Scientific Collaboration, theVirgo Collaboration, theKAGRA Collaboration",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present results from the search for an isotropic gravitational-wave background using Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data from O1 through O4a, the first part of the fourth observing run. This background is the accumulated signal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes information about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the Universe, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from the early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically significant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical scenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3 power-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(25{\rm Hz})\leq 2.0\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement over previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(25{\rm Hz})\leq 2.8\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x sensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting non-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise sources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with population models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we find our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are approaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits shown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary black hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference results and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background arising from compact binary coalescences is $\Omega_{\rm CBC}(25{\rm Hz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest contribution is due to binary black holes only, $\Omega_{\rm BBH}(25{\rm Hz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\times 10^{-9}$.",
Cross submissions,Chemical and Kinetic Equilibrium in Cosmology: Facts and Myths,Stefano Profumo,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We clarify that chemical and kinetic equilibration in the early Universe are distinct: neither implies the other, and the ordering of their decouplings need not be universal. We illustrate this with Standard-Model neutrino decoupling, strong-washout leptogenesis, dark-matter scenarios where kinetic decoupling precedes chemical freeze-out (resonant/forbidden, conversion/coannihilation, coscattering), and dark sectors at with temperatures distinct from the visible-sector temperature, with semi-annihilation or 3 $\to$ 2 cannibal dynamics. The moral of the story is simple: Chemical equilibrium governs numbers, kinetic equilibrium governs shapes. In an expanding Universe the operators that control them rarely fade at the same time, and when they do not, the order of decoupling is model dependent. Turning to phase-space evolution whenever momentum selectivity matters is the surest way to obtain robust cosmological predictions.",
Cross submissions,Baryogenesis via Asymmetric Evaporation of Primordial Black Holes,"Joaquim Iguaz Juan,Yuber F. Perez-Gonzalez,Jessica Turner",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We revisit baryogenesis from the asymmetric evaporation of light primordial black holes, focusing on scenarios where gravitational effects induce a matter antimatter asymmetry. In particular, we consider a higher-dimension operator coupling the Kretschmann scalar to a baryon-number-violating current which generates an effective chemical potential at the black hole horizon and leads to asymmetric Hawking radiation. Relative to earlier studies, we account for entropy dilution from evaporation, incorporate chemical potential dependent greybody factors and numerically track the fully coupled evolution of a PBH population in an expanding universe. We show that the observed baryon asymmetry can be reproduced within a viable region of parameter space for several PBH mass spectra including log-normal, critical-collapse, and power-law distributions.",
