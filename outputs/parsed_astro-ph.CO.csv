New submissions,The MeerKLASS UHF On-the-Fly Continuum Survey -- Data Release I,"Sourabh Paul,Keith Grainge,Mario G. Santos,Suman Chatterjee,Sarvesh Mangla,Laura Wolz,Joseph J. Mohr,Oleg Smirnov,Cyril Tasse,Kristof Rozgonyi,Matthias Hoeft,Yvette Perrott",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present the first public data release (DR1) from the interferometric component of the MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) UHF survey, a legacy program demonstrating a novel on-the-fly (OTF) mapping technique. This release is based on 12 hours of early science observations covering approximately 800 deg$^2$ of the southern sky. We describe the data processing pipeline developed to calibrate and image these fast-scanning observations, producing high-fidelity continuum images at a central frequency of 816 MHz. The resulting mosaic reaches an RMS sensitivity of $\sim$35 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in its deepest regions, with a typical angular resolution of $\sim32'' \times 17''$. In these images, we identify $95483$ radio sources. We validate the catalogue through cross-matching with external surveys, confirming sub-arcsecond astrometric accuracy and a robust flux density scale. We compute the differential source counts, finding excellent agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. The success of this pilot study serves as a crucial proof of concept for the OTF observing strategy, and the public release of the images and source catalogue provides a valuable resource for a wide range of astrophysical studies. This work paves the way for the full MeerKLASS OTF survey and future large-area survey projects with the SKA.",
New submissions,The MeerKLASS On-the-Fly continuum survey: pipeline design and validation,"Suman Chatterjee,Mario G. Santos,Kristof Rozgonyi,Keith Grainge,Sarvesh Mangla,Joseph J. Mohr,Sourabh Paul,Yvette Perrott,Oleg M. Smirnov,Cyril Tasse,Laura Wolz",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) is designed to map large areas of the Southern sky for cosmology using the single-dish HI intensity mapping (IM) technique, while simultaneously delivering a wide, high angular-resolution interferometric survey. We present the design and first results of the MeerKLASS On-the-Fly (OTF) continuum data, which exploits the visibilities recorded during fast, constant-elevation scans. This observing mode enables fast commensal imaging over several hundred of square degrees on a nightly basis.We describe the OTF survey strategy and pipeline, focusing on handling challenges introduced by the current MeerKAT fixed-delay correlation observing mode, which causes decorrelation (smearing). We implement a correction scheme based on time-dependent phase rotation, direction-dependent PSF modeling, and wide-band faceted deconvolution with \texttt{DDFacet}. Using UHF-band and pilot L-band data, we demonstrate the recovery of high-quality 2-second snapshot images and deep mosaics over hundreds of square degrees. After smearing correction we are able to achieve a resolution of $23.3$arcsec and $14$ arcsec with an rms sensitivity of $35 \mu {\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ and $ 33 \mu {\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ in the UHF and L-band respectively.The full survey will cover $10,000 \, {\rm deg}^{2}$ at 544-1088 MHz, and after the delay tracking fix implemented we expect to reach $\sim 25 \mu {\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ at $14$ arcsec resolution. The continuum OTF data products will support diverse science goals, including galaxy and AGN evolution, diffuse cluster emission, large-scale structure and cosmology, rotation-measure synthesis, and transient searches. MeerKLASS-OTF thus establishes an efficient path to wide-area commensal surveys with MeerKAT and provides a key technical precursor for SKA-Mid.",
New submissions,High-Redshift Galaxy Candidates at z > 6 as Revealed by JWST Observations of MACS0647,"Keduse Worku,Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao,Dan Coe,Abdurro'uf,Tom Resseguier,Rebecca L. Larson,Jacqueline Antwi-Danso,Gabriel Brammer,Vasily Kokorev,Larry D. Bradley,Lukas J. Furtak,Masamune Oguri",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a catalog of 57 high-redshift $z>6$ galaxy candidates, including 14 spectroscopic confirmations ($z = 6.10$ -- 9.25), 2 Little Red Dots ($z = 4.77$, 5.81), and 2 interlopers ($z = 3.23$, 3.72), based on \JWST\ NIRCam imaging (7 filters), NIRSpec spectroscopy (PRISM and G395H), and archival \HST\ imaging (17 filters) of the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS0647. Our highest redshift confirmation ($z = 9.25$) is an Extremely Blue Galaxy (presented in~\citealt{Yanagisawa2024}), and here we identify a spectral turnover likely due to damped Lyman-$\alpha$. We identify an overdensity of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts $z = 6.1$, confirming the $z \sim 6$ overdensity identified in \HST\ images. In one of these galaxies, our high-resolution G395H spectroscopy reveals two spatially resolved components with a velocity difference of $\sim$90 km/s; if these components are gravitationally bound, this would imply a dynamical mass on the order of $\sim 10^8\ M_\odot$ given their projected separation. We present spectral line fluxes, widths, and derived physical properties, including stellar masses ($10^8 - 10^9 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and metallicities ($10\% - 40\% \ \mathrm{Z}_{\odot}$) for our spectroscopic sample. We note half of our NIRSpec data was obtained with standard 3-slitlet nods and half was obtained with single slitlets yielding similar results, demonstrating the power to observe more sources on a densely packed NIRSpec MSA.",
New submissions,Constraining the dark matter origin of the halo-like 20 GeV $γ$-ray excess with the AMS-02 antiproton data,"Xiao Wang,Kai-Kai Duan",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Very recently, a significant $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo has been reported and a dark matter origin has been suggested. The inferred dark matter parameters are $ m_\chi \sim 0.5-0.8 $ TeV and $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \sim (5-8) \times 10^{-25}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for the $ b\bar{b} $ channel. If correct, prominent antiproton emission is produced and can be directly tested by the AMS-02 data. In this work we calculate the corresponding antiproton emission and show that the expected flux at $\sim 100$ GeV is already above the AMS-02 observation. A proper treatment on the antiproton background resulting from the high energy cosmic ray propagation would suggest an annihilation cross section of $< 2\times 10^{-26}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$, which is a few$\times 10$ times lower than that needed to interpret the potential signal. We therefore conclude that the $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo is not a viable dark matter signal.",
New submissions,Local Nonlinear Transforms effectively Reveal Primordial Information in Large-Scale Structure,"Yun Wang,Hao-Ran Yu,Yu Yu,Ping He",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"To eliminate gravitational non-Gaussianity, we introduce the $\mathcal{Z}$-$\kappa$ transform, a simple local nonlinear transform of the matter density field that emulates the inverse of nonlinear gravitational evolution. Using $N$-body simulations, we show that the $\mathcal{Z}$-$\kappa$ transform with $\kappa=6$ or $\kappa\to\infty$ (i.e., log) substantially Gaussianizes the density distribution, and recovers the linear power spectrum. In an extended parameter space including primordial non-Gaussianity, summed neutrino mass, and $\Lambda$CDM parameters, Fisher analysis demonstrates that power spectra of transformed fields provide strong complementary constraints. A central result is that these power spectra can directly capture the local primordial non-Gaussianity imprinted in large-scale structure. This opens a new avenue for probing the physics of the early Universe with Stage-IV surveys using two-point statistics.",
New submissions,Nyx-RT: Adaptive Ray Tracing in the Nyx Hydrodynamical Code,"Nathan X. Marshak,Kathlynn Simotas,Zarija Lukić,Hyunbae Park,James Ahrens,Chris R. Johnson",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Numerical methods for radiative transfer play a key role in modern-day astrophysics and cosmology, including study of the inhomogeneous reionization process. In this context, ray tracing methods are well-regarded for accuracy but notorious for high computational cost. In this work, we extend the capabilities of the Nyx N-body / hydrodynamics code, coupling radiation to gravitational and gas dynamics. We formulate adaptive ray tracing as a novel series of filters and transformations that can be used with AMReX particle abstractions, simplifying implementation and enabling portability across Exascale GPU architectures. To address computational cost, we present a new algorithm for merging sources, which significantly accelerates computation once reionization is well underway. Furthermore, we develop a novel prescription for geometric overlap correction with low-density neighbor cells. We perform verification and validation against standard analytic and numerical test problems. Finally, we demonstrate scaling to up to 1024 nodes and 4096 GPUs running multiphysics cosmological simulations, with 4096^3 Eulerian gas cells, 4096^3 dark matter particles, and ray tracing on a 1024^3 coarse grid. For these full cosmological simulations, we demonstrate convergence in terms of reionization history and post-ionization Lyman-alpha forest flux.",
New submissions,A Search for Soft $γ$-ray Emission from the Galaxy Cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell 3667) Using INTEGRAL/ISGRI,"Siddhant Manna,Shantanu Desai",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a search for soft $\gamma$-ray emission from the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell~3667) using archival INTEGRAL/ISGRI observations. This cluster located at $z=0.0556$ hosts prominent radio relics associated with merger-driven shocks, suggesting the presence of relativistic electrons capable of producing inverse-Compton (IC) emission in the 30--300~keV band. Using standard OSA~11.2 imaging and spectral pipelines and a total effective exposure of 2506~s, we find no significant emission at the cluster position in any energy interval. The extracted ISGRI spectrum is consistent with pure background, and no physically meaningful model parameters can be constrained. From the mosaic variance maps, we derive a conservative $3\sigma$ upper limit of $F_{30-300\,\mathrm{keV}} < 6.9 \times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ assuming a power-law spectrum with $\Gamma = 2$. This limit rules out bright IC scenarios and constrains the efficiency of merger-driven particle acceleration in SPT-CL J2012-5649. Our results provide the most stringent soft $\gamma$-ray constraint on this system to date and highlight the need for next-generation hard X-ray missions, such as HEX-P or eXTP, to probe IC emission at theoretically predicted levels in merging clusters.",
New submissions,"CUBE2: A Parallel $N$-Body Simulation Code for Scalability, Accuracy, and Memory Efficiency","Hao-Ran Yu,Bing-Hang Chen,Kun Xu,Ming-Jie Sheng,Jiaxin Han,Yipeng Jing,Huahua Cui",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"$N$-body simulation serves as a critical method for modeling cosmic evolution and represents a significant challenge in high-performance computing. We present CUBE2, a cosmological $N$-body code emphasizing memory efficiency, computational performance, scalability and precision. The core of its algorithm utilizes Particle-Mesh (PM) method to solve the Poisson equation for matter distribution, leveraging the well-optimized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for computational efficiency. In terms of scalability, the multi-level PM spatial decomposition reduces the computational complexity to nearly linear. Precision is ensured by the optimized Green's function that seamlessly bridges gravitational interactions between multi-level PM and Particle-Particle (PP) calculations. The program design enhances per-core/node efficiency in processing $N$-body particles, while a fixed-point data storage format addresses memory constraints for large particle counts. Using CUBE2, we run two cosmological simulations with particle counts of $6144^3$ on the Advanced Computing East China Sub-center (ACECS) to test performance and accuracy.",
New submissions,"Comments on ""Little ado about everything"" by A. Lapi et al. and on cosmological back-reaction",Julian Adamek,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In two papers, A. Lapi et al. introduce and discuss what they call the $\eta$CDM model, a stochastic framework in which they claim that fluctuations in the density field at the scale of tens of Mpc due to structure formation would effectively drive the accelerated expansion of the Universe. They claim that this qualitative behaviour would emerge from the dynamics of standard cold dark matter alone, without introducing any new physics. In this short comment, I argue that such a proposition is implausible. Some of my remarks are relevant more generally to frameworks that try to describe cosmological back-reaction.",
New submissions,Beyond general relativity: probing gravity with gravitational redshifts,"Eleni Tsaprazi,Giorgio F. Lesci,Federico Marulli,Alan F. Heavens,Piero Rosati,Sofia Contarini,Enrico A. Maraboli,Pratika Dayal,Ofer Lahav,Lauro Moscardini",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Despite the success of general relativity (GR), the unexplained nature of dark energy on cosmological scales leaves open the question of whether GR provides a complete description of gravity. This quest is further motivated by growing tensions among cosmological observations when interpreted within $\Lambda$CDM. Gravitational redshifts of cluster member galaxies probe cluster potentials on megaparsec scales directly, complementing conventional large-scale structure tests. Here, we investigate how redshift precision and survey design propagate into constraints on modified gravity using an end-to-end pipeline run on mock catalogues, focusing on mis-centring and spectroscopic completeness. We find that competitive measurements require wide-field spectroscopic cluster surveys explicitly designed to maximise the number of spectroscopically confirmed members per cluster, to enable high-purity stacking, and to control systematic effects.",
New submissions,HALO I: Photometric continuum reverberation mapping of Fairall~9,"Amit Kumar Mandal,Francisco Pozo Nuñe,Vikram Kumar Jaiswal,Mohammad Hassan Naddaf,Bożena Czerny,Swayamtrupta Panda,Paulina Karczmarek,Grzegorz Pietrzy\' nski,Shivangi Pandey,B.

We aim to measure the inter-band continuum time delays through photometric monitoring of Seyfert galaxy Fairall~9 to construct the lag-spectrum. Additionally, we explain the observed features in the Fairall~9 lag-spectrum and discuss the potential drivers behind them, based on our newly collected data from the Obserwatorium Cerro Murphy (OCM) telescope. We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall~9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall~9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $\tau_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{\beta}$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays.",
New submissions,"Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$β$ active galactic nuclei using time-averaged radius$-$luminosity relations with 5100\,Å\,, broad H$β$, and narrow \OIII\ luminosities","Shulei Cao,Amit Kumar Mandal,Michal Zajaček,Bharat Ratra",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been studied as alternate probes in cosmology due to their large and stable luminosities and broad redshift range. Previously it was shown that higher-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped (RM) using broad Mg\,\textsc{ii} and C\,\textsc{iv} lines are standardizable and yield weak cosmological constraints that are consistent with those from better-established probes. In contrast, lower-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped using the broad H$\beta$ line exhibited tensions with the standard cosmological model, in particular they preferred currently decelerating cosmological expansion. Here we study the standardizability of a homogeneous RM H$\beta$ sample of $\sim 100$ AGN (over redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$), whose H$\beta$ time delays and three luminosity tracers (at 5100\,Å\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}]) are averaged over several epochs. We find that this averaged sample is standardizable using three $R-L$ relations. While for luminosities corresponding to 5100\,Å\, and the broad H$\beta$ line the cosmological constraints prefer currently decelerating cosmological expansion, the cosmological parameters for the narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}] luminosity are more consistent with those from better-established probes and they are in agreement with currently accelerating cosmological expansion. This demonstrates for the first time that narrow-line region [O\,\textsc{iii}] can be utilized for AGN standardization and cosmological constraints. Selecting proper photoionizing flux proxies for the broad-line region is thus crucial in studies of RM AGN standardizability.",
New submissions,diffhydro: Inverse Multiphysics Modeling and Embedded Machine Learning in Astrophysical Flows,"Benjamin Horowitz,Zarija Lukić,Kentaro Nagamine,Yuri Oku",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present the extension of the differentiable hydrodynamics code, diffhydro, enabling scalable PDE-constrained inference and integrated hybrid physics-ML models for a wide range of astrophysical applications. New physics additions include radiative heating/cooling, OU-driven turbulence, and self-gravity via multigrid Poisson. We demonstrate good agreement with the Athena++ code on standard validation tests such as Sedov-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and driven/decaying turbulence. We further introduce a solver-in-the-loop neural corrector that reduces coarse-grid errors during time integration while preserving stability. The addition of custom adjoints facilitates efficient end-to-end gradients and multi-device scaling. We present simulations up to 1024^3 elements, run on distributed GPU systems, and we show gradient-based reconstructions of complex initial conditions in turbulent, self-gravitating, radiatively cooling flows. The code is written in JAX, and the solver's modular finite-volume components are compiled by XLA into fused accelerator kernels, delivering high-throughput forward runs and tractable differentiation through long integrations.",
New submissions,The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension,"Adam Smith,Maria Mylova,Carsten van de Bruck,C.P. Burgess,Eleonora Di Valentino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.",
New submissions,Fermionic versus Bosonic Dark Matter in Neutron Stars: A Bayesian Study with Multi-Density Constraints,"Payaswinee Arvikar,Sakshi Gautam,Anagh Venneti,Sarmistha Banik",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We perform a comparative Bayesian analysis of fermionic and bosonic dark matter admixed neutron stars (DMANS) by incorporating a comprehensive set of theoretical, experimental, and astrophysical constraints. The hadronic matter equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field approach, constrained by chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) calculations at low densities, finite nuclei and heavy-ion collision data at intermediate densities, and neutron star (NS) observations at high densities. For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations. The log-evidence and likelihood analyses reveal no statistical preference among the FDM and BDM models, indicating that current astrophysical data cannot decisively distinguish between fermionic and bosonic dark matter scenarios. This study provides a unified statistical framework to constrain dark matter properties using NS observables.",
New submissions,The impact of non-Gaussianity when searching for Primordial Black Holes with LISA,"Antonio Junior Iovino,Gabriele Perna,Hardi Veermäe",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"LISA can observe cosmological millihertz (mHz) gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds that may offer a decisive test for asteroid-mass primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM). In standard scenarios, failing to detect a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background would exclude the last viable window for PBH DM formed through critical collapse. We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA's capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window.",
New submissions,A critical value of the inflationary tensor-to-scalar ratio from inhomogeneous inflation,"Panagiotis Giannadakis,Matthew Elley,Raphael Flauger,Eugene A. Lim",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We show that, for a given fixed value of the number of e-folds of the homogeneous solution, inflation succeeds with order unity inhomogeneities in the initial conditions above a characteristic value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. In practice, we work with an $\alpha$-attractor $T$-model and vary its characteristic scale $\mu$, keeping the initial inhomogeneities in both gradient and kinetic fields of order unity of the inflationary energy scale. Under these conditions, and assuming 100 e-folds for the homogeneous solution, the requirement for 60 e-folds of inflation occurs at a critical characteristic scale $\mu_{crit} \approx 0.02m_{P}$, corresponding to an $r_{crit} \approx 10^{-6}$. Since increasing the amplitude of the inhomogeneities will make inflation less robust and hence require a higher characteristic scale in order for inflation to succeed, for a given number of e-folds achieved by the homogeneous solution $r_{crit}$ is a lower bound.",
New submissions,Reconstructing spatially-varying multiplicative bias for Stage IV weak lensing galaxy surveys with a quadratic estimator,"Konstantinos Tanidis,David Alonso,Lance Miller,Joachim Harnois-Déraps",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a quadratic estimator that detects and reconstructs spatially-varying multiplicative ($m-$) bias in weak lensing shear measurements, by exploiting the $EB$ mode coupling that it generates. The method combines $E$ and $B$ modes with inverse-variance weights, to yield an unbiased reconstruction of $m(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ to first order. We study the ability of future Stage IV surveys to obtain an unbiased reconstruction of the $m$-bias in differing scenarios, considering differing bias morphologies, and characteristic scales, as well as differing metrics to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed map. Considering an $m$ pattern repeating on $\sim 1^\circ\times1^\circ$ sky patches, as might be the case for an $m$ field caused by focal-plane systematics. With a Euclid-like redshift distribution, we find that $\sim5\%$ rms variations in $m$-bias may be detected at the 20$\sigma$ level, after stacking between $\sim400$ and $\sim1000$ patches (rising to between $\sim2800$ and $\sim7600$ for $1\%$ rms variations, data volumes that are becoming available with upcoming surveys), depending on the morphology of the $m$ pattern. We show that these results are robust against the cosmological model assumed in the reconstruction, as well as the presence of intrinsic alignments or baryonic effects, and that the method shows no spurious response to additive ($c-$) bias. These results demonstrate that percent-level, spatially-varying $m-$bias can be detected at high significance, enabling diagnosis and mitigation in the Stage IV weak lensing era.",
New submissions,Bridging Simulations and EFT: A Hybrid Model of the Lyman-Alpha Forest Field,"Roger de Belsunce,Boryana Hadzhiyska,Mikhail M. Ivanov",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The Lyman-alpha (Lya) forest is a unique probe of cosmology and the intergalactic medium at high redshift and small scales. The statistical power of the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) demands precise theoretical tools to model the Lya forest. We present a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) forward model in redshift space that leverages the accuracy of non-linear particle displacements computed using the N-body simulation suite AbacusSummit with the predictive power of an analytical, perturbative bias forward model in the framework of the effective field theory (EFT). The residual noise between the model and the simulated Lya field has a nearly white (scale-and orientation-independent) power spectrum on quasi-linear scales, substantially simplifying its modeling compared to a purely perturbative description. As a consequence of the improved control over the 3D Lya forest stochasticity, we find agreement between the modeled and the true power spectra at the 5 per cent level down to scales of k <= 1 h/Mpc. This procedure offers a promising path toward constructing efficient and accurate emulators to predict large-scale clustering summary statistics for full-shape cosmological analyses of Lya forest data from both DESI and its successor, DESI-II.",
New submissions,Non-parametric exploration of minimally coupled gravity with phantom crossing,"Matteo Cataneo,Kazuya Koyama",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), especially when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and supernova data, favor a late-time dark energy equation of state that crosses $w=-1$, which has been argued to point toward non-minimal conformal coupling in Horndeski gravity. We test this interpretation by performing a non-parametric exploration of the minimally coupled, luminal Horndeski subclass known as kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). Using mochi_class and its manifestly stable effective field theory (EFT) basis implementation, we efficiently scan a broad class of models in which the EFT functions are allowed to vary freely in time, while enforcing the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities from the outset. We identify a set of KGB models that realize phantom crossing and remain broadly consistent with current probes of the background and linear large-scale structure, including CMB temperature and lensing power spectra, redshift-space distortions, cosmic shear, and the cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Our results demonstrate that viable phantom-crossing solutions exist without conformal coupling, motivating future full Bayesian analyses of this model class with non-parametric EFT priors.",
Cross submissions,Born-Infeld signatures in AdS black hole thermodynamics and gravitational lensing,"Ekrem Aydıner,Tekin Dereli,İzzet Sakallı,Erdem Sucu,Ece Seyma Yörük",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of Einstein-Born-Infeld-Anti-de Sitter (EBI-AdS) black holes (BHs). Our study derives the Hawking temperature using standard surface gravity methods and examines quantum corrections through both the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and exponential entropy modifications, showing enhanced thermal radiation and potential remnant formation scenarios. The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $\eta \sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units. The plasma deflection analysis reveals frequency-dependent refractive modifications encoded in the plasma parameter, offering additional possible observational channels.",
Cross submissions,New Massless Spectra from Cosmic String Cusps,"Amelia Drew,Ivan Rybak",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the standard picture of cosmic strings, cusps are generic features of Nambu-Goto loops where the string momentarily reaches the speed of light. They have a characteristic sharp profile, following $y \sim x^{2/3}$ in the $(x,y)$ plane, and produce strong gravitational-wave (GW) bursts with frequency-domain strain $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-4/3}$, making them key targets for current and future GW searches. However, under certain conditions, this generic picture can differ. We identify cusp solutions with different, including smooth, shapes, and compute their massless GW and axion spectra. We derive a general expression for all possible Nambu-Goto cusp spectra with the asymptotic form $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-n/(2n-1)} \omega^{-m/(2m-1)}$ where $n, m\geq 2$. We investigate the effect of realistic corrections to the Nambu-Goto description, such as those from backreaction and finite string width, which introduce a high frequency cutoff.",
Cross submissions,The post-inflationary cosmology of the VISH$ν$ axion-majoron model,"Alexei H. Sopov,Carlos Tamarit,Raymond R. Volkas",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"It was previously shown how several explanatory deficiencies of the Standard Model (including the origin of dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry, small active neutrino mass, strong CP-conservation and the seeds for large-scale structure formation) may be economically resolved when an experimentally-accessible QCD axion also plays the role of the majoron, and the scalar partner of the axion is dynamical during inflation. In this paper, we complete this general study of the cosmological history for a unit domain-wall number option of the DFSZ-type, dubbed VISH$\nu$, by performing a detailed lattice-informed analysis of the reheating era. In doing so, we make inflationary and leptogenesis predictions more precise through estimates of the reheating temperature and the expansion history. The viable reheating scenarios, which at the same time satisfy strict conditions for naturalness (radiative stability), are also shown to respect dark radiation bounds. We also characterise the high-frequency spectrum of gravitational waves, and mention other phenomenological implications that distinguish VISH$\nu$ from alternative proposals.",
Cross submissions,A parameterized equation of state for dark energy and Hubble Tension,"Jing-Ya Zhao,Tong-Yu He,Jia-Jun Yin,Zhan-Wen Han,Rong-Jia Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a parameterized equation of state for dark energy and perform observational tests with the Hubble parameter measurements, the Pantheon supernova sample, baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESI DR2 data. We obtain the best-fit values for the parameters as: $H_0=73.96\pm 0.16$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.2434\pm 0.0079$, and $\alpha=-0.00049\pm 0.00092$, demonstrating that the model exhibits a high degree of consistency with astronomical observations and provides a promising parameterized method for addressing the Hubble tension.",
Cross submissions,Extending Weinberg's EFT: effective scalar-tensor theories up to sixth order,"Eugeny Babichev,Sukŗti Bansal,Maria Mylova,Antonio Padilla",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present a systematic construction of the six-derivative effective scalar-tensor theories, extending the four-derivative framework previously developed by Steven Weinberg. The on-shell effective field theory comprises five parity-even and three parity-odd independent six-derivative scalar-tensor interactions, representing all inequivalent deformations consistent with general covariance. We further confirm this operator counting through an independent analysis using the scattering amplitude formalism in four-dimensional flat spacetime. The six-derivative Lagrangian constructed here provides the next-to-leading-order extension of scalar-tensor gravity, furnishing a robust framework for exploring quantum or stringy corrections, parity-violating interactions, and strong-curvature effects in cosmology, black hole physics and gravitational wave observations.",
Cross submissions,A post-inflationary kinetic axion,"Enrico Morgante,Riccardo Natale",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a novel realization of axion kinetic misalignment, triggered by a Hubble-induced phase transition during a post-inflationary stiff (kination) era. A negative Ricci scalar flips the sign of a non-minimally coupled mass term for a non-minimally coupled complex field $\Phi$, driving its radial mode to large amplitudes via a tachyonic instability. At large $|\Phi|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings. The mechanism populates regions underabundant in standard misalignment, which are accessible to next generation axion searches.",
