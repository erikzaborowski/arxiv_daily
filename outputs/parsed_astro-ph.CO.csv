New submissions,Differential measurement of m_e/m_p: 3 mm methanol lines toward Sagittarius B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds,"J. S. Vorotyntseva,S. A. Levshakov,C. Henkel",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Differential measurement of the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p (the electron-to-proton mass ratio) toward two sources located near the Galactic center - the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds - show a lower mu compared to its terrestrial value. Based on methanol (CH3OH) emission lines from the frequency range 80-112 GHz (IRAM 30-m telescope archival data), the calculated difference (Delta mu)/mu = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab is equal to (-3.0 +/- 0.6)*10^(-7) (1 sigma C.L.) in the whole cloud SgrB2. The revealed 5 sigma signal in mu-variations agrees within the margin of error with the recently obtained result based on methanol emission lines from the higher frequency range 542-543 GHz (Herschel space telescope archival data) for SgrB2(N): (Delta mu)/mu = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7).",
New submissions,Characterising the Standardisation Properties of Type Ia Supernovae in the z band with Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling,"Erin E. Hayes,Suhail Dhawan,Kaisey S. Mandel,David O.

Coulter,Christa Gall,Hua Gao,Luca Izzo,Chien-Cheng Lin,Eugene A. Magnier,Armin Rest,Qinan Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standardisable candles: their peak magnitudes can be corrected for correlations between light curve properties and their luminosities to precisely estimate distances. Understanding SN Ia standardisation across wavelength improves methods for correcting SN Ia magnitudes. Using 150 SNe Ia from the Foundation Supernova Survey and Young Supernova Experiment, we present the first study focusing on SN Ia standardisation properties in the z band. Straddling the optical and near-infrared, SN Ia light in the z band is less sensitive to dust extinction and can be collected alongside the optical on CCDs. Pre-standardisation, SNe Ia exhibit less residual scatter in z-band peak magnitudes than in the g and r bands. SNe Ia peak z-band magnitudes still exhibit a significant dependence on light-curve shape. Post-standardisation, the z-band Hubble diagram has a total scatter of RMS = 0.195 mag. We infer a z-band mass step of $\gamma_{z} = -0.105 \pm 0.031$ mag, which is consistent within 1$\sigma$ of that estimated from gri data, assuming Rv = 2.61. When assuming different Rv values for high and low mass host galaxies, the z-band and optical mass steps remain consistent within 1$\sigma$. Based on current statistical precision, these results suggest dust reddening cannot fully explain the mass step. SNe Ia in the z band exhibit complementary standardisability properties to the optical that can improve distance estimates. Understanding these properties is important for the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory and Nancy G. Roman Space Telescope, which will probe the rest-frame z band to redshifts 0.1 and 1.8.",
New submissions,"Fishing for the Optimal Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey: Cosmological Constraints for 1,000 Possible Surveys","David Rubin,Greg Aldering,Andy Fruchter,Lluis Galbany,Rebekah Hounsell,Rick Kessler,Saul Perlmutter,Ben Rose,Masao Sako,Dan Scolnic,Jannik Truong, theRoman Supernova Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is set to conduct a generation-defining SN Ia cosmology measurement with its High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS). However, between optical elements, exposure times, cadences, and survey areas, there are many survey parameters to consider. This work was part of a Roman Project Infrastructure Team effort to help the Core Community Survey (CCS) Committee finalize the HLTDS recommendation to the Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee. We simulate 1,000 surveys, with and without a conservative (volume-limited) version of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Deep Drilling Field SNe Ia, and compute Fisher-matrix-analysis Dark Energy Task Force Figures of Merit (FoM, based on w0-wa constraints) for each. We investigate which survey parameters correlate with FoM, as well as the dependence of the FoM values on calibration uncertainties and the SN dispersion model. The exact optimum depends on the assumed dispersion model and whether Rubin DDF SNe Ia are also considered, but ~20% time in prism, ~30--40% time in Wide imaging and the remainder in Deep imaging seems most promising. We also advocate for ""interlaced"" cadences where not every filter is used in every cadence step to reduce overheads while maintaining a good cadence and increasing the number of filters compared to the Rose et al. (2021) reference survey (the prism has proportionately lower overheads and can be used for each cadence step). We show simulated light curves and spectra for the baseline HLTDS CCS recommendation and release distance-modulus covariance matrices for all surveys to the community.",
New submissions,Estimating Bolometric Luminosities of Type 1 Quasars with Self-Organizing Maps,"Jie Chen,Linhua Jiang,Shengxiu Sun,Zijian Zhang,Mouyuan Sun",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present a new method to calculate bolometric luminosities for unobscured, type 1 quasars with multi-band photometric data. Bolometric luminosity is a fundamental property to understand quasars and it is commonly estimated from monochromatic luminosities using bolometric corrections that often neglect quasar SED diversity. We take advantage of the fact that most quasars now have multi-band observations from UV to mid-IR, and construct SEDs for a well-defined sample of SDSS quasars at $0.5\leq z\leq 2$. Based on this fiducial sample, we explore quasar SEDs, their diversity, and their relations with bolometric luminosities. We then use unsupervised neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) to describe the SED diversity and compute the bolometric luminosities with a fully-trained SOM model. This method reduces systematical uncertainties compared to the traditional method. In addition, we update the multi-linear regression relations between bolometric luminosity and monochromatic luminosities at restframe 1450Å, 3000Å, and 5100Å. Our method is applicable to large quasar samples with a wide range of luminosity and redshift. We have applied it to the SDSS DR16 quasars. We have also made our code publicly available.",
New submissions,Initial Characterization of Stellar Photometry of Roman images from the OpenUniverse Simulations,"Lauren Aldoroty,Daniel Scolnic,Arun Kannawadi,Rob Knop,Benjamin Rose,Rebekah Hounsell,Michael Troxel",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will provide an opportunity to study dark energy with unprecedented precision and accuracy using several techniques, including measurements of high-$z$ Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia, $z \lesssim 3.0$) via the High-Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS). In this work, we do an initial ""benchmark"" characterization of the photometric repeatability of stellar fluxes, which must be below $1\%$ when sky noise is subdominant in order xto enable a number of calibration requirements. Achieving this level of flux precision requires attention to Roman's highly-structured, spatially-varying, undersampled PSF. In this work, we build a library of effective PSFs (ePSFs) compatible with the OpenUniverse HLTDS simulations. Using our library of ePSFs, we recover fractional flux between $0.6 - 1.2\%$ photometric precision, finding that redder bands perform better by this metric. We also find that flux recovery is improved by up to $20\%$ when a chip (sensor chip assembly; SCA) is divided into 8 sub-SCAs in order to account for the spatial variation of the PSF. With our optimized algorithm, we measure non-linearity due to photometry (magnitude dependence) of $|s_{NL}| < 1.93 \times 10^{-3}$ per dex, which is still larger than stated requirements for detector effects and indicates that further work is necessary. We also measure the dependence of photometric residuals on stellar color, and find the largest possible dependence in R062, implying a color-dependent PSF model may be needed. Finally, we characterize the detection efficiency function of each OpenUniverse Roman filter, which will inform future studies.",
New submissions,Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards as a Robust Test on Late-Time Cosmological Models,"Yihao Wang,Weikang Lin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present a minimally model-dependent framework for testing late-time cosmological models using Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards (UCS), including standard rulers and standard candles, without relying on absolute calibrations. The method exploits a tight, model-insensitive correlation between the sound horizons at recombination and the drag epoch. By avoiding dependence on pre-recombination physics and the amplitude of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, the UCS framework reduces potential early-time biases while retaining much of the constraining power of full analyses. Applying UCS to the recent dynamical dark energy (DE) study that reported deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, we find the constraints shift systematically toward the $\Lambda$CDM case, suggesting the present of pre-recombination physics or systematics that likely affect the scale-dependence of the CMB spectra. We also observe a mild tension between uncalibrated standard rulers and candles, which can be largely mitigated by introducing a redshift-dependent magnitude bias in the supernova (SNe Ia) data. Our results highlights the importance of isolating post-recombination observables for testing late-time models in the era of precision cosmology, positioning UCS analysis as a robust framework for upcoming galaxy surveys.",
New submissions,Numerical evolution of self-gravitating halos of self-interacting dark matter,"Marc Kamionkowski,Kris Sigurdson,Oren Slone",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We discuss a modification of a recently developed numerical scheme for evolving spherically symmetric self-gravitating systems to include the effects of self-interacting dark matter. The approach is far more efficient than traditional N-body simulations and cross sections with different dependencies on velocity and scattering-angle are easily accommodated. To demonstrate, we provide results of a simulation, which runs quickly on a personal computer, that shows the expected initial flattening of the inner region of an NFW halo as well as the later gravothermal collapse instability that leads to a dense core at the galactic center. We note that this approach can also be used, with some augmentation, to simulate the dynamics in globular clusters by modeling gravitational hard scattering as a self-interaction.",
New submissions,Savage-Dickey density ratio estimation with normalizing flows for Bayesian model comparison,"Kiyam Lin,Alicja Polanska,Davide Piras,Alessio Spurio Mancini,Jason D. McEwen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"A core motivation of science is to evaluate which scientific model best explains observed data. Bayesian model comparison provides a principled statistical approach to comparing scientific models and has found widespread application within cosmology and astrophysics. Calculating the Bayesian evidence is computationally challenging, especially as we continue to explore increasingly more complex models. The Savage-Dickey density ratio (SDDR) provides a method to calculate the Bayes factor (evidence ratio) between two nested models using only posterior samples from the super model. The SDDR requires the calculation of a normalised marginal distribution over the extra parameters of the super model, which has typically been performed using classical density estimators, such as histograms. Classical density estimators, however, can struggle to scale to high-dimensional settings. We introduce a neural SDDR approach using normalizing flows that can scale to settings where the super model contains a large number of extra parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this neural SDDR methodology applied to both toy and realistic cosmological examples. For a field-level inference setting, we show that Bayes factors computed for a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) and simulation-based inference (SBI) approach are consistent, providing further validation that SBI extracts as much cosmological information from the field as the BHM approach. The SDDR estimator with normalizing flows is implemented in the open-source harmonic Python package.",

Pugliese,P. Schady,B. Schneider",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The chemical characterization of galaxies in the first billion years after the Big Bang is one of the central goals of current astrophysics. Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been heralded as an effective diagnostic to probe the interstellar medium of their host galaxies and their metal and dust content, up to the highest redshift. An opportunity to fulfill this expectation was provided by the recent blast triggered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of GRB 240218A at redshift z=6.782. We study a high-redshift galaxy selected in a complementary way with respect to flux-limited surveys, not depending on galaxy luminosity and stellar mass. We present the VLT/X-shooter spectrum of its afterglow enabling the detection of neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization and fine-structure absorption lines. We determine the metallicity, kinematics and chemical abundance pattern, providing the first detailed characterization of the neutral gas of a galaxy at z>6.5. From the analysis of fine-structure lines we estimate the distance of the closest gas clouds as $d_{II}=620^{+230}_{-140}$ pc. We determine a high neutral hydrogen column density, $\log(N(HI)/cm^{-2})=22.5\pm0.3$, which is the highest one at z>6 determined so far for a GRB host galaxy, as well as a surprisingly high metal column density, $\log(N(ZnII)/cm^{-2})>14.3$. The observed metallicity of the host galaxy system is [Zn/H]>-0.8. We find evidence of a high amount of dust depletion and of aluminum overabundance, although a number of transitions are saturated. The high hydrogen column density, metal abundances and dust depletion in the neutral gas align with those of the ionized gas of very high-redshift galaxies unveiled by ALMA and JWST, testifying that a rapid build up of metals and dust, and massive neutral hydrogen reservoirs seem to be common features of galaxies in the early Universe.",
New submissions,A novel test of gravity: Does spacetime geometry track matter density?,"Camille Bonvin,Nastassia Grimm,Isaac Tutusaus",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a novel test of gravity that combines galaxy clustering with gravitational lensing. In general relativity, the evolution of matter density fluctuations and of the Weyl potential -- the sum of spatial and temporal distortions of the geometry -- are governed by the same growth function. In contrast, alternative theories of gravity that modify the relation between geometry and matter content can lead to differences in these two growths. Exploiting a recent method to directly measure the Weyl potential, we construct a null test that deviates from zero if and only if there is a mismatch between the growth rate of density and that of geometry distortions. We show that changes in the background expansion due to alternative dark energy models and additional forces in the dark matter sector induce no deviations in this test, making it a robust probe for detecting departures from general relativity. Applying the test to current data, we find no evidence of deviation. From an initial $z_*=10$ to $z\sim 0.5$, we constrain the evolution of the Weyl potential to track that of the density to within 33\%. Combining stage-IV surveys will improve the precision across a broad redshift range, limiting differences between the two evolutions to below $2-4\%$.",
New submissions,Cosmology Constraints from Type Ia Supernova Simulations of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Strategy Recommended by the High Latitude Time Domain Survey Definition Committee,"Richard Kessler,Rebekah Hounsell,Bhavin Joshi,David Rubin,Masao Sako,Rebecca Chen,Vivian Miranda,Benjamin.

Here we generate a catalog-level simulation of the in-guide strategy recommended by the HLTDS definition committee, and determine dark energy parameter constraints using a detailed analysis that includes light curve fitting, photometric redshifts and classification, BEAMS formalism, systematic uncertainties, and cosmology fitting. After analysis and selection requirements, the sample includes 10,000 Roman SNe Ia that we combine with 4,500 events from LSST. The resulting dark energy figure of merit is well above the NASA mission requirement of 326, with the caveat that SN Ia model training systematics have not been included.",
New submissions,CSST Cosmological Emulator III: Hybrid Lagrangian Bias Expansion Emulation of Galaxy Clustering,"Shuren Zhou,Zhao Chen,Yu Yu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxy clustering is an important probe in the upcoming China Space Station Telescope (CSST) survey to understand the structure growth and reveal the nature of the dark sector. However, it is a long-term challenge to model this biased tracer and connect the observable to the underlying physics. In this work, we present a hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion emulator, combining the Lagrangian bias expansion and the accurate dynamical evolution from $N$-body simulation, to predict the power spectrum of the biased tracer in real space. We employ the Kun simulation suite to construct the emulator, emulating across the space of 8 cosmological parameters including dynamic dark energy $w_0$, $w_a$, and total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. The sample variance due to the finite simulation box is further reduced using the Zel'dovich variance control, and it enables the precise measurement of the Lagrangian basis spectra up to quadratic order. The emulation of basis spectra realizes 1% level accuracy, covering wavelength $ k \leq 1 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$ and redshift $0\leq z\leq 3$ up to quadratic order field. To validate the emulator, we perform the joint fitting of the halo auto power spectrum and the halo-matter cross power spectrum from 46 independent simulations. Depending on the choice of counterpart, the joint fitting is unbiased up to $k_{\rm max}\simeq 0.7\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$ with $1\sim 2$ percent accuracy, for all the redshift and halo mass samples. As one of the CSST cosmological emulator series, our emulator is expected to provide accurate theoretical predictions of the galaxy power spectrum for the upcoming CSST survey.",

Pillepich",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Feedback from supernovae and AGN shapes galaxy formation and evolution, yet its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray (ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population. Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about 0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups and hydro simulations.",
New submissions,Model selection using the HII galaxy Hubble diagram,"Jun-Jie Wei,Fulvio Melia",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The proposal to use HII galaxies (HIIGx) and giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHR) as standard candles to construct the Hubble diagram at redshifts beyond the current reach of Type Ia supernovae has gained considerable support recently with the addition of five new HIIGx discovered by JWST. The updated sample of 231 sources now extends the redshift range of these objects to $z\sim 7.5$, mapping the Universe's expansion over $95\%$ of its current age. In this {\it Letter} we use these sources for model selection, and show that the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe is strongly favored by this probe over both flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, with relative Bayesian Information Criterion probabilities of, respectively, $91.8\%$, $7.4\%$ and $0.8\%$. A possible caveat with these results, however, is that an unknown dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm int}$, in the HIIGx standard candle relation can weaken the model comparisons. We find that the inclusion of $\sigma_{\rm int}$ as an additional, optimizable parameter makes the likelihoods of flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$ about equal, though at the expense of creating $\sim 2.5\sigma$ tension between our inferred matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and its {\it Planck}-optimized value.",

Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and Pulsar Polarization Arrays (PPAs) aim to detect this dark matter through timing and polarization measurements, respectively, of pulsars. The PTA relies on gravitational effects, as the ALDM halo perturbs the spacetime metric within the Milky Way, while the PPA detects non-gravitational effects, namely cosmological birefringence induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with photons. These two methods complement each other, synergistically enhancing the pulsar array's capability to identify the ALDM signals in the data. In this article, we provide a foundational development of this synergy. We begin by revisiting previously derived two-point correlation functions for both PTA and PPA, and expand our analysis to include correlations between timing and polarization signals. We then construct likelihood functions for PTA and combined PTA-PPA analyses within a Bayesian framework, aimed at detecting the characteristic correlations of ALDM signals. We emphasize the non-Gaussianity of the ALDM timing signals, which arises from their non-linear dependence on the field, in contrast to the Gaussian nature of its polarization signals. To address the complexities introduced, we approach this investigation in two ways: one involves a Gaussian approximation with proper justifications, while the other derives the formalism from the generic Gaussian characteristics of the ALDM field. We anticipate that these efforts will lead to further developments in PTA and PTA-PPA analysis methods.",
New submissions,Learning Balanced Field Summaries of the Large-Scale Structure with the Neural Field Scattering Transform,"Matthew Craigie,Yuan-Sen Ting,Rossana Ruggeri,Tamara M. Davis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a cosmology analysis of weak lensing convergence maps using the Neural Field Scattering Transform (NFST) to constrain cosmological parameters. The NFST extends the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) by incorporating trainable neural field filters while preserving rotational and translational symmetries. This setup balances flexibility with robustness, ideal for learning in limited training data regimes. We apply the NFST to 500 simulations from the CosmoGrid suite, each providing a total of 1000 square degrees of noiseless weak lensing convergence maps. We use the resulting learned field compression to model the posterior over $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$ in a $w$CDM cosmology. The NFST consistently outperforms the WST benchmark, achieving a 16% increase in the average posterior probability density assigned to test data. Further, the NFST improves direct parameter prediction precision on $\sigma_8$ by 6% and w by 11%. We also introduce a new visualization technique to interpret the learned filters in physical space and show that the NFST adapts its feature extraction to capture task-specific information. These results establish the NFST as a promising tool for extracting maximal cosmological information from the non-Gaussian information in upcoming large-scale structure surveys, without requiring large simulated training datasets.",
New submissions,Learning Intrinsic Alignments from Local Galaxy Environments,"Matthew Craigie,Eric Huff,Yuan-Sen Ting,Rossana Ruggeri,Tamara M. Davis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present DELTA (Data-Empiric Learned Tidal Alignments), a deep learning model that isolates galaxy intrinsic alignments (IAs) from weak lensing distortions using only observational data. The model uses an Equivariant Graph Neural Network backbone suitable for capturing information from the local galaxy environment, in conjunction with a probabilistic orientation output. Unlike parametric models, DELTA flexibly learns the relationship between galaxy shapes and their local environments, without assuming an explicit IA form or relying on simulations. When applied to mock catalogs with realistic noisy IAs injected, it accurately reconstructs the noise-free, pure IA signal. Mapping these alignments provides a direct visualization of IA patterns in the mock catalogs. Combining DELTA with deep learning interpretation techniques provides further insights into the physics driving tidal relationships between galaxies. This new approach to understanding and controlling IAs is suitable for application to joint photometric and spectroscopic surveys such as the combination of upcoming Euclid, Rubin, and DESI datasets.",

Its flux discharges by the nucleation of membranes that source it. The tension and charge of the membranes are set by the chiral symmetry breaking scale $\sim 10^{-3} eV$, and the dark energy is a transient. It decays on the order of the current age of the universe. The decays decrease dark energy discretely and randomly, instead of gradually like rolling scalars.

By using non-perturbative lattice simulations to determine the rate of sphaleron transitions in the entire $(x,y)$-plane corresponding to the Higgs phase, and by applying previous lattice results for the bubble nucleation, we find a condition $x(T_c) \lesssim 0.025$ to guarantee preservation of the baryon asymmetry, which translates to $v/T_c \equiv \sqrt{2 \langle \phi^\dagger \phi \rangle}/T_c \gtrsim 1.33$ for the (gauge-invariant) Higgs condensate. This indicates that viability of the electroweak baryogenesis requires the phase transition to be slightly stronger than previously anticipated. Finally, we present a general template for analysing such viability in a wide class of beyond the Standard Model theories, in which new fields are heavy enough to be integrated out at high temperature.",
Cross submissions,2024 TASI Lectures: A Dark Matter Primer,Tien-Tien Yu,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"These notes are based on a sequence of 4 lectures delivered at the 2024 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute (TASI) and at the Università degli Studi di Padova. They are intended for graduate students at the early stages of their study of dark matter with some prior exposure to cosmology and quantum field theory. The primary aim is to offer an accessible introduction to dark matter and to lay the groundwork for exploring its phenomenology. These lectures are not intended to serve as a comprehensive review. We begin by motivating the study of dark matter through a discussion of the empirical evidence and the constraints it places on dark matter properties. This is followed by an overview of several canonical mechanisms for the production of cosmological dark matter, and a concluding section that surveys current experimental and observational efforts to detect it with a focus on direct detection.",
