New submissions,Physical parameter regression from black hole images via a multiscale adaptive neural network,"Jialei Wei,Ao Liu,Dejiang Li,Cuihong Wen",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"High-precision regression of physical parameters from black hole images generated by General Relativistic Ray Tracing (GRRT) is essential for investigating spacetime curvature and advancing black hole astrophysics. However, due to limitations in observational resolution, high observational costs, and imbalanced distributions of positive and negative samples, black hole images often suffer from data scarcity, sparse parameter spaces, and complex structural characteristics. These factors pose significant challenges to conventional regression methods based on simplified physical models. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces Multiscale Adaptive Network (MANet) , a novel regression framework grounded in deep learning. MANet integrates an Adaptive Channel Attention (ACA) module to selectively enhance features in physically informative regions. Meanwhile, a Multiscale Enhancement Feature Pyramid (MEFP) is employed to capture fine-grained spatial structures such as photon rings and accretion disks, while alleviating information loss due to downsampling. Experimental evaluations on GRRT-simulated datasets demonstrate that MANet substantially improves parameter estimation accuracy and generalization capability in high-dimensional parameter spaces, outperforming existing baseline approaches. This framework presents a promising avenue for high-precision parameter regression in Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data analysis and broader astrophysical imaging applications characterized by sparse and noisy data.",
New submissions,oLIMpus: An Effective Model for Line Intensity Mapping Auto- and Cross- Power Spectra in Cosmic Dawn and Reionization,"Sarah Libanore,Julian B. Munoz,Ely D. Kovetz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting various spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A key remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse emission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present oLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power spectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21, applying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our code accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it includes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, CII, CO line luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond auto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and lightcones, and with a computational time of $\sim s$ it is ideal for parameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it easy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC analyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations.",

Riess,Vincenzo Ripepi,Martino Romaniello,Daniel Scolnic,Erasmo Trentin,Piotr Wielgorski,Wenlong Yuan",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"By comparing Cepheid brightnesses with geometric distance measures including Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, most recent analyses conclude metal-rich Cepheids are brighter, quantified as $\gamma \sim -0.2$ mag/dex. While the value of $\gamma$ has little impact on the determination of the Hubble constant in contemporary distance ladders (due to the similarity of metallicity across these ladders), $\gamma$ plays a role in gauging the distances to metal-poor dwarf galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds and is of considerable interest in testing stellar models. Recently, Madore & Freedman (2025, hereafter MF25) recalibrated Gaia EDR3 parallaxes by adding to them a magnitude offset to match certain historic Cepheid parallaxes which otherwise differ by $\sim1.6\sigma$. A calibration which adjusts Gaia parallaxes by applying a magnitude offset (i.e., a multiplicative correction in parallax) differs significantly from the Gaia Team's calibration (Lindegren et al. 2021), which is additive in parallax space - especially at distances much closer than 1 kpc or beyond 10 kpc, outside the $\sim$2-3 kpc range on which the MF25 calibration was based. The MF25 approach reduces $\gamma$ to zero. If extrapolated, it places nearby cluster distances like the Pleiades too close compared to independent measurements, while leaving distant quasars with negative parallaxes. Further, by shortening the Milky Way distance scale, the MF25 calibration raises the local Hubble constant by $\sim$1 km/s/Mpc, increasing the Hubble tension significantly. We conclude that the MF25 proposal for Gaia calibration and $\gamma \sim 0$ produces farther-reaching consequences, many of which are strongly disfavored by the data.",

We perform combined-probe studies using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), in combination with three existing weak lensing surveys, to test and constrain General Relativity (GR) in the context of the standard model of cosmology (LCDM). We focus on measuring the gravitational estimator statistic, E_G, which describes the relative amplitudes of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy velocities induced by a common set of overdensities. By comparing our amplitude measurements with their predicted scale- and redshift-dependence within the GR+LCDM model, we demonstrate that our results are consistent with the predictions of the Planck cosmology. The redshift span of the DESI dataset allows us to perform these E_G measurements at the highest redshifts achieved to date, z ~ 1.",
New submissions,Dissecting Reionisation with the Cosmic Star Formation and AGN Luminosity History,"Jordan C. J. D'Silva,Simon P. Driver,Claudia D. P. Lagos,Aaron S. G. Robotham,Nathan J.

Ryan Jr.,Haojing Yan",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The combination of the $z=0-13.5$ cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history as inferred by the James Webb Space Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 1 - 100\%$ for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could have achieved reionisation by $z\approx 6$ with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} \gtrsim 10-30\%$, depending on the metallicity. On the other hand, AGN by themselves would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 100\%$. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is explored where we find best fit (median$\pm 1\sigma$) $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 12\%$ ($12^{+10}_{-11}\%$) for the stars and $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 63\%$ ($79^{+21}_{-44}\%$) for the AGN, maintained at all redshifts. In essence, the joint growth of stellar mass and super massive black holes produces neither more or less ionising photons than needed to reionise $\gtrsim 99\%$ of the intergalactic medium by $z\approx 6$.",
New submissions,Simba Simulation: The Effect of Feedback Physics on Matter Distribution in the Cosmic Web,"Chenze Dong,Florian Dedieu,Daniela Galárraga-Espinosa,Khee-Gan Lee,Daniele Sorini,Romeel Davé",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The discrepancy between the early-time estimation and late-time observation on the cosmic baryon content - the 'missing baryon problem' - is a longstanding problem in cosmology. Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs) have largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of these baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the partitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is sensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution with feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates how feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic structures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web method to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments, sheets, and voids. We then analyze how the different feedback variants of Simba affect the distribution of matter within each structure. Our results show that in Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only a few percent under different feedback models. However, jet feedback produces noticeable changes in the gas distribution within structures, enhancing the diffuse IGM on the outskirts of filaments and knots. This research provides a new perspective on the impact of feedback on the IGM and motivates a refined data model for the FRB foreground mapping.",
New submissions,Observational constraints on phenomenological emergent dark energy and barotropic dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state parameter,"Jian-Qi Liu,Yan-Hong Yao,Yan Su,Jia-Wei Wu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"While cold dark matter is widely supported by a range of cosmological observations, it encounters several difficulties at smaller scales. These issues have prompted the investigation of various alternative dark matter candidates, leaving the question ""What is dark matter?"" still open. In this work, we propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. We then place constraints on our new model using the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae (Ia SNe), and the Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) data from Gold2018. The results show statistically significant signal for positive dark matter equation of state and square of sound speed $w_{\rm dm}=c_{\rm s,dm}^2$ ($10^{7}w_{\rm dm}$ = $4.0^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ at the 95\% confidence level) for the data combination CMB+DESI+PP+RSD. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that this data combination favors the $\Lambda$CDM model with very strong evidence.",
New submissions,An AI super-resolution field emulator for cosmological hydrodynamics: the Lyman-α forest,"Fatemeh Hafezianzadeh,Xiaowen Zhang,Yueying Ni,Rupert A. C. Croft,Tiziana DiMatteo,Mahdi Qezlou,Simeon Bird",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph),"We extend our super-resolution and emulation framework for cosmological dark matter simulations to include hydrodynamics. We present a two-stage deep learning model to emulate high-resolution (HR-HydroSim) baryonic fields from low-resolution (LR-HydroSim) simulations at redshift $z = 3$. The method takes as inputs an LR-HydroSim and the high-resolution initial conditions (HR-HydroICs). First, the model stochastically generates high-resolution baryonic fields from the LR-HydroSim. Second, a deterministic emulator refines these fields using HR-HydroICs to reconstruct small-scale structures including displacement, velocity, internal energy, and gas/star classification. Trained on paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with \texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the intergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc pressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The model achieves subpercent error for overdensity, temperature, velocity, and optical depth fields, a mean relative error of 1.07\% in the large-scale flux power spectrum (\(k < 3 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{s/km}\)), and less than 10\% error in the flux probability distribution function. Notably, the two-stage model reduces the compute time by a factor of $\sim$450 compared to full smoothed particle hydrodynamics at the same resolution. This work demonstrates the potential of this framework as a powerful and efficient tool for generating high-resolution fields offering fast and accurate alternatives to traditional cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and enabling large-volume mock datasets for next-generation cosmological surveys.",
New submissions,Ly$α$ Emission from [OIII] Emitters Near Reionization: The role of environment in galaxy Ly$α$ detection,"Seyedazim Hashemi,George D. Becker,Yongda Zhu,Hui Hong",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Using galaxy Ly$\alpha$ emission to probe reionization relies on establishing baseline expectations for its detectability in the absence of attenuation by neutral gas in the IGM. Towards this end, the growing numbers of $z \sim 5$--6 star-forming galaxies spectroscopically selected by JWST provide an ideal sample for determining how Ly$\alpha$ emission depends on galaxy properties and environment after reionization has largely completed. In this study, we use Keck LRIS to measure the Ly$\alpha$ emission of 46 JWST-selected [OIII]-emitting galaxies over $5.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.2$ in the foreground of the ultra-luminous quasar J0100+2802. Overall, we find that the fraction of galaxies detected in Ly$\alpha$ emission is consistent with previous works; however, the fraction also varies with environment. Most notably, we find an apparent deficit of Ly$\alpha$ in the largest group in our sample, at $z \simeq 6.19$, which falls within the redshift range of the quasar's highly ionized proximity zone. We speculate that the Ly$\alpha$ emission from this group may be partly scattered by a foreground neutral island. In contrast, we detect a high rate of Ly$\alpha$ emission in two groups at $z \simeq 5.73$ and $z \simeq 5.78$. These groups may be part of a structure that is extended along the line of sight, enhancing the transmission of Ly$\alpha$ emission. While our sample size is limited, our results suggest that environment may play a significant role in the detectability of galaxy Ly$\alpha$ emission even as late as $z \sim 6$.",
New submissions,The THESAN project: environmental drivers of Local Group reionization,"Yu Zhao(1,2),Aaron Smith(3),Rahul Kannan(4),Enrico Garaldi(5),Hui Li(6),Mark Vogelsberger(7),Andrew Benson(2),Lars Hernquist(8) ((1) USC, (2) Carnegie, (3) UT Dallas, (4) York, (5) IPMU, (6) Tsinghua, (7) MIT, (8) Harvard)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The timing of cosmic reionization across Local Group (LG) analogues provides insights into their early histories and surrounding large-scale structure. Using the radiation-hydrodynamic simulation THESAN-1 and its dark matter-only counterpart THESAN-DARK-1, we track the reionization histories of all haloes, including 224 LG analogues within the proximity of any of the 20 Virgo-like clusters with halo masses above 10^14 Msun at z=0 and their environments. The statistically controlled samples quantify how the reionization redshift (z_reion) correlates with halo mass, local overdensity, and present-day pair properties. Even at fixed mass, haloes in denser regions ionize earlier, and increasing the overdensity smoothing scale systematically suppresses small-scale structure, including local variations and environmental gradients in z_reion. Virgo-like clusters accelerate reionization in their surroundings out to ~5-10 cMpc, beyond which local overdensity again becomes the dominant factor. Within LG pairs, reionization timing offsets reach up to ~150 Myr and correlate with present-day halo separation, reflecting sensitivity to large-scale structure rather than mass ratio in driving asynchronous reionization. The results support an extreme inside-out picture where clustered sources rapidly ionize their immediate neighborhoods, while lower-density regions self-ionize later and voids wait for external homogenization. These links between environment and reionization timing explain the influence of protoclusters and help interpret fossil records in LG dwarfs around the Milky Way. For Milky Way analogues, we find a reionization redshift as early (late) as z_reion = 12.7^{+2.0}_{-1.7} (8.88^{+0.66}_{-0.70}) when considered on 125 ckpc (500 ckpc) scales, with LG analogues following an inside-out reionization picture.",
New submissions,Investigating Interacting Dark Energy Models Using Fast Radio Burst Observations,"Hang Yan,Yu Pan,Jia-Xin Wang,Wen-Xiao Xu,Ze-Hui Peng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This paper investigates the utility of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as novel observational probes to constrain models of interacting dark energy (IDE). By leveraging FRB dispersion measures (DMs) and redshifts, we perform a comprehensive analysis of three IDE models: gamma_m IDE, gamma_x IDE, and xi IDE, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on 86 localized FRBs and simulated datasets containing 2500 to 10000 mock events. By disentangling the contributions to the observed DMs from the Milky Way, host galaxies, and the intergalactic medium (IGM), key cosmological parameters are constrained, including the Hubble constant (H0), matter density (Omega_m), the dark energy equation of state (omega_x), and interaction strengths (gamma_m, gamma_x, xi). The best-fit values of the gamma_m IDE model indicate a potential alleviation of the cosmic coincidence problem. Subsequently, we utilize information criteria (IC) to conduct a comparative assessment of the three IDE models. When applied to the current sample of observed FRBs, the xi IDE model yields slightly lower IC values than the gamma_m IDE and gamma_x IDE models across all three criteria, although the differences are not statistically significant. These results underscore the value of FRB measurements as complementary probes that provide further constraints on alternative cosmological models.",
New submissions,"Cosmological Preference for a Positive Neutrino Mass at 2.7$σ$: A Joint Analysis of DESI DR2, DESY5, and DESY1 Data","Guo-Hong Du,Tian-Nuo Li,Peng-Ju Wu,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.",

Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Measurements of galaxy distributions at large cosmic distances capture clustering from the past. In this study, we use a cosmological model to translate these observations into the present-day galaxy distribution. Specifically, we reconstruct the 3D matter power spectrum at redshift $ z = 0 $ using Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 (DR1) galaxy clustering data and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, assuming the $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $ model, and compare it to the result assuming the $ w_0w_a \text{CDM} $ model. Building on previous state-of-the-art methods, we apply Effective Field Theory (EFT) modelling of the galaxy power spectrum to account for small-scale effects in the 2-point statistics of galaxy data. The EFT approach offers a more robust methodology than traditional methods for modelling the galaxy power spectrum from galaxy clustering data, which can be used to test the consistency of the assumed cosmological model. By incorporating both CMB and galaxy clustering data across a range of redshifts, we can identify discrepancies between the datasets, which would indicate potential inaccuracies in the assumed expansion history. While previous studies have shown consistency with $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $, this work extends the analysis with higher-quality data to further test the expansion histories of both $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $ and $ w_0w_a \text{CDM} $.

New submissions,Forecast constraints on null tests of the $Λ$CDM model with SPHEREx,"Alejandro Mata Román,Indira Ocampo,Savvas Nesseris",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work we quantify the ability of the upcoming SPHEREx survey to constrain cosmological observables and test the internal consistency of the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Using Fisher matrix forecasting, we assess the expected precision on Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) observables, such as the angular diameter distance $D_\mathrm{A}(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We further explore SPHEREx's potential to probe some of the fundamental assumptions of large-scale spatial homogeneity and isotropy, through model-independent reconstructions of several consistency tests of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, we also examine the effect of the model dependence of the resulting Fisher and covariance matrices, using a neural network (NN) classification approach. We find that, while it is commonly assumed the covariance matrix depends weakly on the model, in fact the NN can very accurately ($\sim 98\%$) detect the underlying fiducial cosmological model based solely on the covariance matrix of the data, thus challenging this assumption.",

We combine an empirical $\mathtt{UniverseMachine}$ galaxy-halo model with a simple spherical expanding shell model for the Lyman-$\alpha$ radiative transfer, calibrating only three free parameters to simultaneously reproduce the observed Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosity function and the angular clustering. Our LAE model is further supported by its consistency with other observables such as the Lyman-$\alpha$ equivalent width distribution, the Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fraction as a function of stellar mass and dust reddening, and the systemic velocity offsets. Our LAE model provides predictions for the halo occupation distributions for LAEs and relationship between Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and halo mass, including the distribution of satellite LAEs. Our work provides a crucial first step towards creating a high-fidelity LAE synthetic catalog for the LAE cosmology surveys. We make our LAE catalog and spectra publicly available upon publication.",
New submissions,Planck constraints on the scale dependence of isotropic cosmic birefringence,"M. Ballardini,A. Gruppuso,S. Paradiso,S.S. Sirletti,P. Natoli",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The rotation of the linear polarisation plane of photons during propagation, also known as cosmic birefringence, is a powerful probe of parity-violating extensions of standard electromagnetism. Using Planck legacy data, we confirm previous estimates of the isotropic birefringence angle, finding $\beta \simeq 0.30 \pm 0.05$ [deg] at 68% CL, not including the systematic error from the instrumental polarisation angle. If this is a genuine signal, it could be explained by theories of Chern--Simons-type coupled to electromagnetism, which could lead to a harmonic scale-dependent birefringence signal, if the hypothesis of an ultra-light (pseudo) scalar field does not hold. To investigate these models, we pursue two complementary approaches: first, we fit the birefringence angle estimated at different multipoles, $\beta_{\ell}$, with a power-law model and second, we perform a non-parametric Bayesian reconstruction of it. Both methods yield results consistent with a non-vanishing constant birefringence angle. The first method shows no significant dependence on the harmonic scale (up to $1.8\sigma$ CL), while the second method demonstrates that a constant model is favored by Bayesian evidence. This conclusion is robust across all four published Planck CMB solutions. Finally, we forecast that upcoming CMB observations by Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD and a wishful CMB-Stage 4 experiment could reduce current uncertainties by a factor of approximately 7.",
New submissions,"Weinberg's theorem, phantom crossing and screening",Philippe Brax,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider models where the dilaton, seen as the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, plays the role of dark energy. We revisit Weinberg's theorem and show that quantum corrections induced by the graviton lead to the screening of the dilaton locally. We also discuss the time evolution of the equation of state and find that phantom crossing is a natural feature of these models. The time variation of the equation of state and its deviation from $-1$ is limited by screening locally and can only be relaxed when the dilaton is allowed to have a mass of the order of the Hubble rate cosmologically, thus going beyond single-field screened dark-energy models. This obstruction extends to all single-field screened models of the chameleon-type where the large mass of the scalar on cosmological scales leads to a negligible variation of the equation of state at low redshift.",
New submissions,Artifacts in Halo Shapes: Imprints of the Initial Condition,"Yu Yu,Zhao Chen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Grid type pre-initial conditions are commonly used to initialize particle positions in cosmological simulations. While these conditions are known to produce noticeable numerical artifacts in void regions, their impact on halo properties has generally been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we employ multiple simulations to demonstrate that grid initialization induces statistically significant artifacts in halo shapes, despite the modest absolute amplitude ($\sim 1\%$) making them unimportant for most cosmological studies. We identify a redshift-dependent artificial alignment pattern: at low redshifts ($z<2$), halo shapes preferentially orient away from the simulation box's Cartesian axes, whereas their constituent particles initially exhibit alignment with these axes. We propose a mathematical hypothesis to explain this flipping behavior.",

We find that when the mixing between the inflaton perturbation and the vector-field perturbation is sufficiently strong in the anisotropic inflation, the power spectrum becomes dominated by anisotropic constant modes.

Our findings offer a novel approach to probe vector fields during inflation and to test the cosmic no-hair conjecture.",

We curate a sample of 20 nearby FRBs with low scattering timescales and face-on host galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^9 < M^* / M_\odot < 10^{11}$. We fit the distribution of the host galaxy DM to a quadratic model as a function of stellar mass with a mass-independent scatter and find that the more massive the host, the lower its host DM. We report that this relation has a negative slope of $m = -97 \pm 44$ pc/cm$^{-3}$ per dex in stellar mass. We compare this measurement to similar fits to three sub-grid models implemented in the CAMELS suite of simulations from Astrid, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA and find that fine-tuning of the host ISM contribution as a function of stellar mass is required in order to reconcile the observational data with the predictions of the fiducial CAMELS-Astrid model. More generally, models which attribute a positive correlation between stellar mass and host dispersion measure ($m > 0$) to the CGM are in tension with our measurement. We show that this conclusion is robust to a wide range of assumptions, such as the offset distribution of FRBs from their hosts and the statistics of the cosmic contribution to the DM budget along each sightline.

Cross submissions,Probing displaced (dark)photons from low reheating freeze-in at the LHC,"Paola Arias,Bastián Díaz Sáez,Lucía Duarte,Joel Jones-Perez,Walter Rodriguez,Danilo Zegarra Herrera",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"We extend the Standard Model (SM) by introducing a $U(1)'$ gauge boson and a real pseudo-scalar field, both odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting low-energy spectrum consists of a stable vector as the dark matter candidate, and a pseudo-scalar mediator, which interacts with the SM via a Higgs portal coupling and a dimension-five portal connecting it to both the dark and visible photons. We explore the freeze-in of both particles at low reheating temperature, finding a rich yield evolution dynamics in the early Universe. This setup brings a consistent dark matter scenario in which the dark photon relic abundance is generated through freeze-in at low reheating temperatures. In addition to its cosmological viability, the model can be tested at the LHC: Higgs bosons can decay into dark photons and displaced visible photons via the long-lived mediator. These signatures allow us to constrain the Higgs portal coupling using recent searches for non-pointing photons and limits on invisible or undetected Higgs decays. We derive meaningful constraints on the dark matter parameter space, in particular excluding a thermalized mediator in the region compatible with the observed relic abundance.",
Cross submissions,Wino and Real Minimal Dark Matter Excluded by Fermi Gamma-Ray Observations,"Benjamin R. Safdi,Weishuang Linda Xu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We show that minimal, fermionic dark matter (DM) models in the $n$-dimensional representation of the weak force with zero hypercharge that make up 100% of the DM under the standard cosmological history are strongly excluded for $n < 9$. This includes the thermal wino, which we show is ruled out even allowing for DM core sizes up to $\sim$6.7 kpc with the preferred local DM density or $\sim$3.7 kpc in addition to the local DM density being half the preferred value, at less than $0.2$ GeV/cm$^3$. We reach these conclusions through dedicated searches with 14 years of Fermi gamma-ray data in the inner Galaxy between 30 GeV and 2 TeV for the continuum gamma-rays produced in the decays of unstable particles produced in DM annihilation and bound-state formation processes. We consider a variety of Milky Way DM profiles in our analyses, including those motivated by modern hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, and show that all the $n < 9$ minimal DM models are disfavored even under the most conservative assumptions for these density profiles. While wino, quintuplet ($n=5$), and $n = 7$ DM models are strongly disfavored by our analyses under the standard cosmology, we discuss how non-standard cosmological histories or DM sub-fractions could still allow for these particles to be realized in nature, with discovery opportunities at next-generation particle colliders and gamma-ray telescopes.",
Cross submissions,Testing Real WIMPs with CTAO,"Matthew Baumgart,Salvatore Bottaro,Diego Redigolo,Nicholas L. Rodd,Tracy R. Slatyer",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"We forecast the reach of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to the full set of real representations within the paradigm of minimal dark matter. We employ effective field theory techniques to compute the annihilation cross section and photon spectrum that results when fermionic dark matter is the neutral component of an arbitrary odd and real representation of SU(2), including the Sommerfeld enhancement, next-to-leading log resummation of the relevant electroweak effects, and the contribution from bound states. We also compute the corresponding signals for scalar dark matter, with the exception of the bound state contribution. Results are presented for all real representations from the $\sim$3 TeV triplet (or wino), a $\mathbf{3}$ of SU(2), to the $\sim$300 TeV tredecuplet, a $\mathbf{13}$ of SU(2) that is at the threshold of the unitarity bound. Using these results, we forecast that with 500 hrs of Galactic Center observations and assuming background systematics are controlled at the level of ${\cal O}(1\%)$, then should no signal emerge, CTAO could exclude all representations up to the $\mathbf{11}$ of SU(2) in even the most conservative models for the dark-matter density in the inner galaxy, in both the fermionic and scalar dark matter cases. Assuming the default CTAO configuration, the tredecuplet will marginally escape exclusion, although we outline steps that CTAO could take to test even this scenario. In summary, CTAO appears poised to make a definitive statement on whether real WIMPs constitute the dark matter of our universe.",
Cross submissions,Distinguishing Neutron Star vs. Low-Mass Black Hole Binaries with Postmerger Gravitational Waves $-$ Sensitivity to Transmuted Black Holes and Non-Annihilating Dark Matter,"Sulagna Bhattacharya(Tata Inst.),Shasvath Kapadia(IUCAA),Basudeb Dasgupta(Tata Inst.)",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The astrophysical origin of observed low-mass compact binary coalescences in the 1-2.5 $M_{\odot}$ range remains ambiguous. Both binary neutron star (BNS) and binary low-mass black hole (LMBH) mergers produce nearly identical inspiral waveforms, and electromagnetic follow-up is not always possible. Distinguishing between these scenarios therefore presents a key challenge. We demonstrate that waveform differences in the late-inspiral to postmerger epochs create significant mismatches that will be detectable by planned detectors, viz., NEMO, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope, while the currently operational LIGO A+ will be effective only for nearby sources. These differences are enhanced for stiffer equations of state. We show how the redshift-dependent compact binary merger rate inferred from gravitational wave observations can be parsed into BNS and LMBH components, accounting for misclassification probability. We forecast model-independent 90% exclusion sensitivities for the LMBH fraction. Interpreting these LMBHs as dark matter capture-induced transmuted black holes, we convert exclusion sensitivities into projected exclusion bounds on heavy non-annihilating dark matter. Our results illustrate how gravitational wave measurements can disentangle compact object populations and provide new insights into particle dark matter interactions.",

Shoemaker",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"The DAMIC-M collaboration recently reported impressive bounds on sub-GeV dark matter, robustly testing both thermal and non-thermal models for the very first time. In this work we derive novel bounds from the recent PandaX-4T ionization S2-only search for Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS). We find that the PandaX-4T S2-only data is able to compete with the DAMIC-M results, providing the best constraints for scalar and asymmetric thermal dark matter models for masses between 20 to 200 MeV. We further discuss the implications of recent direct detection results for several other sub-GeV dark matter models, highlighting their complementarity with astrophysical, cosmological and laboratory probes.",

We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.",
Cross submissions,Probing Double-Peaked Gamma-Ray Spectra from Primordial Black Holes with Next-Generation Gamma-Ray Experiments,"C. J. Ouseph,Giorgio Busoni,John Gargalionis,Sin Kyu Kang,Anthony G. Williams",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Primordial black holes (PBHs), hypothesized to form in the early universe from gravitational collapse of density fluctuations, represent a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. Their potential detection through gamma-ray signatures arising from Hawking radiation would provide definitive evidence for their existence and constrain their contribution to the DM abundance. Unlike conventional DM candidates, PBHs emit a unique, thermal-like spectrum of particles as they evaporate, including photons, neutrinos, and possible beyond-the-Standard Model particles. Future high-sensitivity gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM and other next-generation telescopes, will play a pivotal role in this search. With improved energy resolution and sensitivity, these missions can disentangle PBH-originating photons from astrophysical backgrounds, probe subtle spectral features such as multi-peak structures, and test exotic evaporation models. Such observations could either confirm PBHs as a viable DM component or place stringent limits on their abundance across critical mass windows. In this work, we explore the distinguishing features of a double-peaked gamma-ray spectrum produced by PBHs, focusing on the asteroid-mass window ($10^{15}$ g to $10^{17}$ g), where Hawking radiation peaks in the MeV to GeV range. Using a likelihood-based analysis, we demonstrate how future missions could discriminate between single- and double-peaked PBH scenarios, the latter arising in cosmological models predicting multi-modal PBH mass distributions. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of spectral shape analysis in identifying PBH populations and constrain the parameter space for which a double-peaked signal could be detectable above background.",
Cross submissions,Split supersymmetry and hybrid inflation in light of Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 data,"Nobuchika Okada,Qaisar Shafi",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Inspired by the recent measurement of the scalar spectral index, $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data, we present an update on the split supersymmetry hybrid inflation model, also known as $\mu$-term hybrid inflation. The model employs a canonical Kähler potential but incorporates an additional renormalizable term in the superpotential $W$, which yields the MSSM $\mu$-term following supersymmetry breaking. This additional term in $W$ is responsible for a high reheat temperature, $T_r \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV, and consequently the necessity of split supersymmetry in this class of models. The predicted scalar spectral index is in excellent agreement with the ACT measurement and $r$, the tensor to scalar ratio, is estimated to be less than or of order $10^{-2} -10^{-3}$. For the running of the scalar spectral index we find $|dn_s/d \ln k| = O(10^{-4})$. With $T_r \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV, leptogenesis is readily implemented in this class of models. A wino-like LSP with mass of around 2 TeV is a plausible dark matter candidate.",
Cross submissions,Impact of cavities on the detection of quadratically coupled ultra-light dark matter,"Clare Burrage,Angus Macdonald,Michael P. Ross,Gray Rybka,Elisa Todarello",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Ultra-light scalar fields may explain the nature of the dark matter in our universe. If such scalars couple quadratically to particles of the Standard Model the scalar acquires an effective mass which depends on the local matter energy density. The changing mass causes the field to deviate from its cosmological value in experimental environments. In this work we show that the presence of a local over-density enclosing the experiment, for example a cavity, vacuum chamber, or satellite can strongly suppress the value of the scalar and its gradient in the interior. This makes detection of such scalar dark matter challenging, and significantly relaxes constraints on strongly coupled models. We also discuss the possibility that quadratically coupled ultra-light scalar dark matter could be detected by the differential measurement of the force on two cavities of the same mass but different internal structure.",

Rephrasing this conversion as a classical electrodynamics problem in the far-field regime of a magnetized region, we derive the angular distribution of the intensity and polarization of the emitted electromagnetic waves. We discuss the interplay of the internal structure of the magnetic field, the polarization of the gravitational wave and the scattering angle, demonstrating for example that a dipolar field can convert an unpolarized stochastic gravitational wave background into polarized electromagnetic emission, with peak emission intensity along the equator. We moreover outline how to incorporate medium effects in this framework, necessary for a realistic 3D description of gravitational wave to photon conversion in the magnetosphere of neutron stars.",

Background Evolution,"Samuele Silveravalle,Andrea Lapi,Francesco Benetti,Stefano Liberati",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore a cosmological model in which dark matter is non-minimally coupled to gravity at the fluid level. While typically subdominant compared to Standard Model forces, such couplings may dominate dark matter dynamics. We show that this interaction modifies the early-time Friedmann equations, driving a phase of accelerated expansion that can resolve the horizon and flatness problems without introducing additional fields. At even earlier times, the coupling to spatial curvature may give rise to a cosmological bounce, replacing the initial singularity of standard cosmology. These results suggest that non-minimally coupled dark matter could offer a unified framework for addressing both the singularity and fine-tuning problems.",
Cross submissions,Multi-field TDiff theories: the mixed regime case,"Antonio L. Maroto,Prado Martín-Moruno,Diego Tessainer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study theories breaking diffeomorphism (Diff) invariance down to the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff), consisting of multiple scalar fields in a cosmological background. In particular, we focus on models involving a field dominated by its kinetic term and a field dominated by its potential, coupled to gravity through power-law functions of the metric determinant. The Diff symmetry breaking results in the individual energy-momentum tensors not being conserved, although the total conservation-law is satisfied. Consequently, an energy exchange takes place between the fields, acting as an effective interaction between them. With this in mind, we consider the covariantized approach to describe the theory in a Diff invariant way but with an additional field, and discuss the phenomenological consequences of these models when it comes to the study of the dark sector.",
