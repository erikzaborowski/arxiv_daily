New submissions,"Haskap Pie: A Halo finding Algorithm with efficient Sampling, K-means clustering, tree-Assembly, Particle tracking, Python modules, Inter-code applicability, and Energy solving","Kirk S. S. Barrow,Thinh Huu Nguyen,Edward C. Skrabacz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We describe a new Python-based stand-alone halo finding algorithm, Haskap Pie, that combines several methods of halo finding and tracking into a single calculation. Our halo-finder flexibly solves halos for simulations produced by eight simulation codes (ART-I, ENZO, RAMSES, CHANGA, GADGET-3, GEAR, AREPO and GIZMO) and for both zoom-in or full-box N-body or hydrodynamical simulations without the need for additional tuning or user-specified modeling parameters. When compared to Rockstar and Consistent Trees, our halo-finder tracks subhalos much longer and more consistently, produces halos with better constrained physical parameters, and returns a much denser halo mass function for halos with more than 100 particles. Our results also compare favorably to recently described specialized particle-tracking extensions to Rockstar. Our algorithm is well-suited to a variety of studies of simulated galaxies and is particularly robust for a new generation of studies of merging and satellite galaxies.",
New submissions,$\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$: fast differentiable angular power spectra beyond Limber,"Laura Reymond,Alexander Reeves,Pierre Zhang,Alexandre Refregier",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The upcoming stage IV wide-field surveys will provide high precision measurements of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. Their interpretation requires fast and accurate theoretical predictions including large scales. For this purpose, we introduce $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$, a fast, accurate and differentiable $\texttt{JAX}$-based pipeline for the computation of the angular power spectrum beyond the Limber approximation. It uses a new FFTLog-based method which can reach arbitrary precision and includes interpolation along $k$, allowing for $k$-dependent growth factor and biases. $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ includes a wide range of probes and effects such as galaxy clustering, including magnification bias, redshift-space distortions and primordial non-Gaussianity, weak lensing, including intrinsic alignment, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing and CMB integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We compare our pipeline to the other available beyond-Limber codes within the N5K challenge from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Dark Energy Science Collaboration. $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ computes the 120 different angular power spectra over 103 $\ell$-multipoles in 5 ms on one GPU core. Using a pre-calculation, $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ is thus about 40$\times$ faster than the winner of the N5K challenge with comparable accuracy. Furthermore, all outputs are auto-differentiable, facilitating gradient-based sampling and robust and accurate Fisher forecasts. We showcase a Markov Chain Monte Carlo on an LSST-like survey as well as a Fisher forecast, illustrating $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$'s differentiability, speed and reliability in measuring cosmological parameters. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.",
New submissions,The galaxy-halo connection of disc galaxies over six orders of magnitude in stellar mass,"Pavel E. Mancera Piña,Justin I. Read,Stacy Kim,Antonino Marasco,José A. Benavides,Marcin Glowacki,Gabriele Pezzulli,Claudia del P. Lagos",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"(Abridged) The relations between stellar ($M_\ast$), gas ($M_{\rm gas}$), baryonic ($M_{\rm bar} = M_\ast + M_{\rm gas}$), and dark matter halo mass ($M_{200}$) provide unique constraints on galaxy formation and cosmology. The shape of the relations constrains how galaxies regulate their growth through gas accretion, star formation, and feedback; their scatter probes the stochasticity of galaxy assembly.Here, we assemble a sample of 49 nearby gas-rich dwarf and massive disc galaxies with unmatched ancillary data. We obtain their gas kinematics and derive their dark matter properties through rotation curve decomposition. Our sample allows us to study the galaxy-halo connection across nearly six orders of magnitude in $M_\ast$. We find that the $M_{\rm gas}-M_{200}$ relation rises monotonically, with galaxies having around 4 per cent of the average cosmological baryon fraction in cold gas. Contrastingly, the $M_\ast-M_{200}$ relation shows a more complex behaviour. A particularly interesting finding is that of a population of baryon-deficient' dwarfs (BDDs) with stellar masses $\sim 1-1.5$ orders of magnitude lower than expected from current models. Yet, baryon-rich galaxies also exist, and we find a large spread in the baryon retention fraction across our galaxies. We compare our findings with semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations. While the simulations broadly reproduce most observed features, they struggle to match the BDDs and do not capture the diversity in baryon fractions. Understanding these differences will shed new light on how feedback regulates galaxy formation. Finally, we study the dark matter halo concentration-mass relation. We find that below $M_{200} \sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, the concentrations are systematically lower than expected. We discuss whether these results stem from the influence of baryonic physics or the environment.",
New submissions,Lorentz Violation with Gravitational Waves: Constraints from NANOGrav and IPTA Data,"Alireza Allahyari,Mohammadreza Davari,David F. Mota",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore a theoretical framework in which Lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken by incorporating derivative terms of the extrinsic curvature into the gravitational action. These modifications introduce a scale-dependent damping effect in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs), governed by a characteristic energy scale denoted as $M_{LV}$ . We derive the modified spectral energy density of GWs within this model and confront it with recent observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). Our analysis yields a lower bound on the Lorentz-violating energy scale, finding $M_{LV} > 10^{-19}$ GeV at 68\% confidence level. This result significantly improves upon previous constraints derived from LIGO/VIRGO binary merger observations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to probe fundamental symmetries of spacetime and offer new insights into possible extensions of general relativity.",
New submissions,Basic Elements of Strong Gravitational Lensing,"Paul L. Schechter,Jeremy D. Schnittman",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Even when used to describe the same phenomenon, equations, graphics and words each give different perspectives and lead to complementary insights. The basic elements of strong gravitational lensing are introduced here favoring words and graphics over equations whenever possible. Fermat's principle is the fundamental driver of strong lensing. Three ""D's'' encapsulate the essential effects of lensing: Delay, Deflection and Distortion. Gravity and geometry both contribute to the delay of photons from a lensed source. Their interplay determines how the images of a source are deflected and how they are stretched or compressed. Caustics and critical curves are explained. Images of doubly, triply, quadruply and quintuply lensed sources are displayed. A table of symbols, their definitions and distinctions provides a summary of the basic elements of strong lensing.",
New submissions,The Phase Space of Low-Mass Binary Compact Objects from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Catalog: Hints on the Chances of Different Formation Scenarios,"Samsuzzaman Afroz,Suvodip Mukherjee",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational wave (GW) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of binary compact object (BCO) formation, yet directly linking these observations to specific formation scenarios remains challenging. The BCO phase space provides a robust and data-driven approach to discover the likely formation scenarios of these binaries. In this study, we expand the previously introduced binary black hole phase-space technique to encompass low-mass compact objects (LMCOs), establishing a novel framework to investigate their diverse formation mechanisms. Applying this approach to selected low-mass events $(\lesssim 5 M_\odot)$ from the GWTC-3 catalog and the recently observed GW230529 event, we show for the first time the phase-space demonstration of the LMCOs and find the associated probabilities for different formation scenarios including neutron stars, astrophysical black holes, or primordial black holes. Our analysis includes the astrophysical modelling uncertainties in and how it causes degeneracy between different formation scenarios. In future, with improvements in GW detector sensitivity and with detection of more GW events, the LMCO phase-space framework will significantly strengthen our capacity to associate more likely formation scenarios over the other, thereby refining our understanding of compact object formation for both astrophysical and primordial scenarios, and its evolution across the cosmic redshift.",
New submissions,An Accurate Modeling of Nano-Hertz Gravitational Wave Signal from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes: Essential Step Towards a Robust Discovery,"Mohit Raj Sah,Akash Maurya,Suvodip Mukherjee,Prayush Kumar,Vida Saeedzadeh,Arif Babul,Chandra Kant Mishra,Kaushik Paul,Thomas R. Quinn,Michael Tremmel",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz (nHz) regime, detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offers a promising avenue to probe the cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). These SMBHBs are expected to retain substantial eccentricity throughout their evolution due to their formation history. In this study, we propose a new modeling scenario of the nHz SGWB by incorporating the eccentricity of SMBHBs into a multi-scale adaptive simulation-based framework. We employ a time-domain eccentric waveform model, \esigmahm{}, to generate realistic gravitational wave (GW) signals from an astrophysical population of SMBHB, including physical effects from sub-parsec scales to Gpc scales. The eccentric inspiraling binary, unlike circular binaries, emits GW signal in multiple frequencies. As a consequence, the SGWB energy density in each frequency bin is not independent; instead, the presence of eccentricity introduces a spectral correlation between different frequencies. We show that these spectral correlations are absent for circular binaries but become increasingly significant for populations with higher eccentricities. Our novel approach can capture this effect and opens up the window towards measuring this with a high signal-to-noise ratio with future observations. This work develops the frontier of nHz signal modeling using eccentricity at small scales and can model realistic nHz signal, which will be essential for robust inference from future observations to shed light on the astrophysical properties of SMBHBs.",
New submissions,Forecasting Constraints on Non-Thermal Light Massive Relics from Future CMB Experiments,"Arka Banerjee,Abhik Bhattacharjee,Subinoy Das,Anshuman Maharana,Ravi Kumar Sharma",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we present Fisher forecasts on non-thermal LiMR models for the upcoming CMB Stage IV experiment -- particularly focusing on a model of inflaton/moduli decay giving rise to non-thermally distributed dark sector particles, and also comparing our results with those for sterile particles following the Dodelson-Widrow distribution. Two independent parameters, the effective number of extra relativistic species $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ and the effective mass $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ of the relic, influence linear cosmological observables. We find $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ to be more tightly constrained with $\sigma(\Delta N_\mathrm{eff})\sim10^{-3}$, for a less abundant, heavier LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic around matter-radiation equality than a more abundant, lighter LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic just after recombination, for which $\sigma(\Delta N_\mathrm{eff})\sim10^{-2}$. The uncertainties on $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ differ by a factor of $\sim3$ between the two cases. Our analysis also reveals distinct parameter correlations: the phenomenological parameters $\{\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}, M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}\}$ are found to be negatively correlated for the former case and positively correlated for the latter. We obtain similar constraints on the cosmological parameters (in either case) for both the inflaton/moduli decay and the Dodelson-Widrow models when the first two moments of the LiMR distribution function, related to the phenomenological parameters, are matched. Finally, by constructing a modified distribution that matches the first two moments of the Dodelson-Widrow but deviates maximally in the third moment, we demonstrate that CMB Stage IV data is not expected to be sensitive to higher moments of the distribution.",
New submissions,CHEX-MATE: The Impact of Triaxiality and Orientation on Planck SZ Cluster Selection and Weak Lensing Mass Measurements,"H. Saxena,J. Sayers,A. Gavidia,J.B. Melin,E.T. Lau,J. Kim,L. Chappuis,D. Eckert,S. Ettori,M. Gaspari,F. Gastaldello,S. Kay,L. Lovisari,F. Oppizzi,M.D. Petris,G.W. Pratt,E. Pointecouteau,E. Rasia,M. Rossetti,M. Sereno",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxy cluster abundance measurements are a valuable tool for constraining cosmological parameters like the mass density ($\Omega_m$) and density fluctuation amplitude ($\sigma_8$). Wide area surveys detect clusters based on observables, such as the total integrated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signal ($Y_{SZ}$) in the case of Planck. Quantifying the survey selection function is necessary for a cosmological analysis, with completeness representing the probability of detecting a cluster as a function of its intrinsic properties. Employing a Monte-Carlo method, we inject triaxial cluster profiles into random positions within the Planck all-sky maps, and subsequently determine the completeness of the Planck-selected CHEXMATE sample as a function of both geometry and SZ brightness. This is then used to generate 1000 mock CHEX-MATE cluster catalogs, and the distribution of shapes and orientations of the detected clusters, along with any associated bias in weak lensing-derived mass ($M_{WL}$) due to this orientation-dependent selection, denoted as $1 - b_{\chi}$, is obtained. We show that cluster orientation impacts completeness, with a higher probability of detecting clusters elongated along the line of sight (LOS). This leads to $1 - b_{\chi}$ values of $0-4\%$ for CHEXMATE clusters relative to a random population. The largest increase in $M_{WL}$ is observed in the lowest mass objects, which are most impacted by orientation-related selection bias. This bias is relevant for upcoming SZ surveys like CMB-S4, and should be considered for surveys utilizing other probes for cluster detection, such as Euclid.",
New submissions,Compartmentalization in the Dark Sector of the Universe after DESI DR2 BAO data,"Marcel van der Westhuizen,David Figueruelo,Rethabile Thubisi,Shambel Sahlu,Amare Abebe,Andronikos Paliathanasis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We consider a non-linear interaction between the dark matter and dark energy components of the universe. In particular, within the FLRW geometry, where dark matter is described by a dust fluid and dark energy by an ideal gas with a constant equation of state parameter, we introduce energy transfer between the two fluids. The effective cosmological fluid leads to a unified dynamical dark energy model with the feature that the Hubble function admits an analytic expression. We study this model using the DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations data and the Supernova data from Pantheon+. The interacting model fits the data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\chi_{\text{model}}^{2}-\chi_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}^{2}=-5$. Using the Akaike Information Criterion to compare the two models, we derive $\text{AIC}_{\operatorname{model}}-\text{AIC}_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}=-1$, from which we conclude that the interacting model is marginally better supported by the data than the $\Lambda$CDM, but the difference is not statistically significant.",
New submissions,Toward a simultaneous resolution of the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions: early dark energy and an interacting dark sector model,Mai Yashiki,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The tension between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and that measured from late-time observations, such as the local distance ladder, is a major challenge in modern cosmology. Early dark energy (EDE) has been proposed as a possible resolution to the $H_0$ tension, but it typically worsens the $S_8$ tension by enhancing the small-scale matter power spectrum due to an increased cold dark matter density. To address this issue, we propose a model that combines EDE with an interacting dark energy-dark matter (iDEDM) scenario, and investigate whether this mixed model can simultaneously resolve both tensions. We find that the DE-DM interaction suppress the growth of structure and reduce $S_8$, while EDE contributes to increase $H_0$, although less effectively than in the EDE-only case. Our MCMC analysis using Planck 2018, DESI BAO, DES, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data shows that the mixed model provides modest improvements in both tensions, although it does not fully resolve either. This limitation appears to stem from the fact that both EDE and iDEDM independently favor a higher present-day matter density, which reduces the angular diameter distance and limits the degree to which EDE can lower the sound horizon.",
New submissions,A view of the CIZA J2242.8+5301 galaxy cluster at very low radio frequencies,"G. Lusetti,M. Brüggen,H. W. Edler,F. de Gasperin,M. Hoeft,G. Di Gennaro,D. Hoang,T. Pasini,R. van Weeren,V. Cuciti,H. Rottgering,G. Brunetti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The galaxy cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 is a well-studied merging galaxy cluster that hosts prominent double radio relics including the famous sausage relic, as well as other diffuse radio sources. Observations at frequencies below 100 MHz are essential for investigating the physics of radio relics as they provide unique access to the low-energy population of cosmic-ray electrons. We aim to study the morphology, spectral characteristics, and physical processes that produce relics. We present the first observations of the Sausage cluster at 45 MHz, the lowest radio frequency at which this cluster has been studied to date, using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) of the LOFAR radio interferometer. We made use of ten hours of LOFAR LBA observations, from which we achieved a thermal-noise limited radio image with a noise level of 1.5 mJy/beam at a resolution of 15 arcsec. These data were combined with existing multi-frequency measurements at higher frequencies: LOFAR High Band Antenna, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. This broad frequency coverage allowed us to derive integrated spectral indices, spectral index and curvature maps, and Mach number distributions across the relics. We derived Mach numbers from the local injection index measure using low-frequency data with M_N = 2.9 +-0.5 for the northern relic and M_S = 2.9+-0.8 for the southern relic. LOFAR LBA observations reveal a remarkably symmetric surface brightness profile across the eastern part of the northern relic, with wings extending on either side of the peak. This discovery is contrary to the expectation of particle acceleration at a single, sharp shock and the subsequent downstream advection of accelerated electrons. We modelled the surface brightness profile, including the effects of projection, magnetic field variation, and shock deformation.",
New submissions,Constraining primordial curvature perturbations with present and future GW detectors,Mauro Pieroni,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Primordial scalar curvature perturbations ($\zeta$), typically probed on large cosmological scales via CMB and LSS observations, can be significantly enhanced on smaller scales by various early Universe mechanisms, for instance, non-minimal inflationary models. While decoupled at linear order, scalar and tensor perturbations, i.e., Gravitational Waves (GWs), interact at second order. As a consequence, an enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum $P_\zeta(k)$ can source a sizable stochastic GW background (SGWB). In these proceedings, we briefly review the generation mechanism of such signals, typically referred to as scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs), and discuss the prospects of measuring them with present and future Pulsar Timing Arrays datasets and future GW observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA.",
New submissions,Colloquium: The Cosmic Dipole Anomaly,"Nathan Secrest,Sebastian von Hausegger,Mohamed Rameez,Roya Mohayaee,Subir Sarkar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Cosmological Principle, which states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic (when averaged on large scales), is the foundational assumption of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies such as the current standard Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. This simplification yields an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that relates space and time through a single time-dependent scale factor, which defines cosmological observables such as the Hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift. The validity of the Cosmological Principle, which underpins modern cosmology, can now be rigorously tested with the advent of large, nearly all-sky catalogs of radio galaxies and quasars. Surprisingly, the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is found to be inconsistent with the expectation from kinematic aberration and Doppler boosting effects in a perturbed FLRW universe, which is the standard interpretation of the observed dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although the matter dipole agrees in direction with that of the CMB dipole, it is anomalously larger, demonstrating that either the rest frames in which matter and radiation appear isotropic are not the same, or that there is an unexpected intrinsic anisotropy in at least one of them. This discrepancy now exceeds 5{\sigma} in significance. We review these recent findings, as well as the potential biases, systematic issues, and alternate interpretations that have been suggested to help alleviate the tension. We conclude that the cosmic dipole anomaly poses a serious challenge to FLRW cosmology, and the standard {\Lambda}CDM model in particular, as an adequate description of our Universe.",
New submissions,Metagalactic Ultraviolet Background Tables for Calculating Diffuse Astrophysical Plasma Properties,"Elias Taira,Claire Kopenhafer,Brian W. O'Shea",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In developing a deeper understanding of the Circumgalactic Medium, one feature that is poorly understood is the nature of the ultraviolet background (UVB) and its impact on observed column densities. A wide array of UVB models have been created over the years by many different authors, each based on the latest observational data available at the time. In addition to having a large variance between model properties, the formatting between released models is also inconsistent.This data release provides reformatted versions of several widely-used ultraviolet background models-Faucher-Giguère et al. 2009, Haardt and Madau 2012, Puchwein et al. 2019, and Faucher-Giguère 2020-such that each model is in the same units and thus can be utilized to directly compare these models over a wide redshift range. This release also includes code to run a 'cloudy_cooling_tools' pipeline to generate ionization tables for different UVB models.",
New submissions,The Intracluster Light of Abell 3667: Unveiling an Optical Bridge in LSST Precursor Data,"Anthony Englert,Ian Dell'Antonio,Mireia Montes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Intracluster light, the diffuse glow of stars stripped from galaxies during a cluster's formation, is an established tracer of a cluster's dynamical history. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is set to revolutionize studies of intracluster light by imaging the entire southern sky down to a limiting surface brightness $\mu \gtrsim 30\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2$ by year ten. In this letter, we create a precursor LSST dataset (reaching the equivalent of year eight depth) using DECam observations of Abell 3667 and study its intracluster light. We have discovered a low surface brightness ($ \mu \gtrsim 26\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2 $) optical bridge extending over $\sim 400\text{ kpc}$ which connects the two brightest galaxies (BCG1 and BCG2) in the cluster; the color and surface brightness of the bridge is consistent with formation via a major merger. The inner regions of BCG1 ($r < 200\text{ kpc}$) and BCG2 ($r < 50\text{ kpc}$) are consistent with formation via gradual stripping of satellite galaxies, but BCG2's outer profile appears disrupted by a recent merger. We hypothesize that the bridge is a relic of a recent first-pass between the two brightest galaxies and is composed of stars being stripped from BCG2. Future studies of intracluster light with LSST will discover new features such as the bridge in local clusters while enabling detailed studies of the stellar populations of these features with its six photometric bands.",
New submissions,Perturbative Likelihoods for Large-Scale Structure of the Universe,Rodrigo Voivodic,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This work presents a formalism for deriving likelihoods of the cosmological density field directly from first principles within Perturbation Theory (PT). By assuming a perturbative expansion around the Gaussian initial density field and additional stochastic components, we analytically compute two forms of the likelihood. Full marginalization over all underlying fields yields the likelihood of the observed density field, expressed in terms of its summary statistics (such as the power spectrum and bispectrum), which are naturally given by the formalism, and conditioned on model parameters. Marginalizing only over the stochastic fields results in the field-level likelihood. A key strength of this method is its ability to automatically specify the precise combinations of initial field covariances and PT expansion kernels required at each perturbative order (e.g., tree-level power spectrum and bispectrum, and the 1-loop power spectrum). This guarantees that the resulting likelihoods are fully consistent with PT at the chosen order of accuracy, avoiding ad-hoc choices in constructing the statistical model.",
New submissions,Turbulence in Primordial Dark Matter Halos and Its Impact on the First Star Formation,"Meng-Yuan Ho,Ke-Jung Chen,Pei-Cheng Tung",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15 minihalos with masses ranging from $\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ at redshifts $z \sim 17 - 20$, using the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations incorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from the state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required resolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the resolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\sim 10^5$, reaching gas and dark matter particle masses of $0.2\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ and $80\ \text{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion during the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong turbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark matter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach numbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic turbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense clumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse into the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a common feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy star-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function of the first stars.",

Dent,Bhaskar Dutta,Jason Kumar,Danny Marfatia",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"We consider the formation of Q-balls in false vacuum remnants during a cosmological first-order phase transition. We find that under certain circumstances Q-balls can collapse to form primordial black holes. This scenario can produce multimessenger signals that may be observed at upcoming experiments, including 1-100 nHz gravitational waves from the phase transition, and gamma-rays emitted from primordial black holes as Hawking radiation and as superradiance. These signals are quite distinctive, and differ markedly from signals expected from Fermi-balls. The reheating of the dark sector from the phase transition may address the Hubble tension.",
Cross submissions,Explaining the PeV Neutrino Fluxes at KM3NeT and IceCube with Quasi-Extremal Primordial Black Holes,"Michael J. Baker,Joaquim Iguaz Juan,Aidan Symons,Andrea Thamm",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The KM3NeT experiment has recently observed a neutrino with an energy around 100 PeV, and IceCube has detected five neutrinos with energies above 1 PeV. While there are no known astrophysical sources, exploding primordial black holes could have produced these high-energy neutrinos. For Schwarzschild black holes this interpretation results in tensions between the burst rates inferred from the KM3NeT and IceCube observations, and with indirect constraints from the extragalactic gamma ray background. In this letter we show that if there is a population of primordial black holes charged under a new dark $u(1)$ symmetry which spend most of their time in a quasi-extremal state, the neutrino emission at 1 PeV may be more suppressed than at 100 PeV. The burst rates implied by the KM3NeT and IceCube observations and the indirect constraints can then all be consistent at $1\sigma$. Furthermore, these black holes could constitute all of the observed dark matter in the universe.",
Cross submissions,Langer's nucleation rate reproduced on the lattice,"Joonas Hirvonen,Oliver Gould",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We show that Langer's rate of bubble nucleation is quantitatively correct up to small higher-loop corrections, in comparison to lattice simulations. These results are a significant advancement on decades of lattice studies showing only qualitative trends, and the first showing agreement for any conservative system. We confirm that the failure to fully thermalize the metastable phase explains discrepancies with recent lattice studies that found disagreement with Langer's rate. The key theoretical development is the translation of Langer's perturbative definition of a thermal metastable phase into a nonperturbative statement that can be implemented on the lattice. Our statistical and systematic errors are small enough to allow us to measure on the lattice the coefficient of the two-loop contribution, missing from the perturbative prediction. Our conclusions also exclude a possible systematic uncertainty in $^3$He experiments.",
Cross submissions,On the Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction,"Mark P. Hertzberg,Daniel Jiménez-Aguilar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.",
Cross submissions,Kinetically Modified Palatini Inflation Meets ACT Data,C. Pallis,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We show that the coexistence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity fR=1+cR phi^(n/2) with a kinetic mixing of the form fk=fR^m -- where n=2 and 4 and 0.5<m<10 -- reconciles chaotic inflation based on the phi^n potential with the recent ACT results, if we adopt the Palatini formulation of gravity. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. The model can be also embedded in supergravity by introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. Its stabilization is achieved thanks to a compact contribution to the Kaehler potential, whose the inflationary part includes an holomorphic logarithmic term and a real one multiplying a shift-symmetric quadratic polynomial term.",
Cross submissions,Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories,"Mark P. Hertzberg,Oleksandr S. Stashko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.",
