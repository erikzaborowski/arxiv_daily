New submissions,Collisionless relaxation to quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos: origin of the universal NFW profile,"Uddipan Banik,Amitava Bhattacharjee",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph),"Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of these attractor states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation is not well understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius. Subsequent accretion and relaxation around this $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ fall-off, establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile, a quasi-steady state attractor of collisionless relaxation that is not particularly sensitive to initial conditions. Given enough time though, the halo tends to Maxwellianize and develop an isothermal sphere profile. We demonstrate for the first time that the universal NFW profile emerges as an attractor solution to a self-consistent theory for collisionless relaxation.",
New submissions,Primordial Gravitational Waves from Phase Transitions during Reheating,"Amitayus Banik,Nicolás Bernal,Fazlollah Hajkarim",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We study primordial gravitational waves (GWs) generated from first-order phase transitions (PTs) during cosmic reheating. Using a minimal particle physics model, and a general parametrization of the inflaton energy density and the evolution of the Standard Model temperature, we explore the conditions under which PTs occur and determine the corresponding PT parameters (the PT temperature, duration and strength), which depend on the evolution of the background during reheating. We find that, in certain cosmological scenarios, PTs can be delayed and prolonged compared to the standard post-inflationary evolution. Incorporating these PT parameters, we compute the resulting GW spectrum generated from the various processes occurring during a first-order PT: bubble collisions, sound waves, and magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. We find that, in comparison to the standard cosmological history, the GW amplitude and peak frequency can be modified by several orders of magnitude due to the additional enhancement or suppression arising from the cosmological evolution during reheating. In particular, the GW spectra could be within the reach of next-generation GW and CMB observatories.",
New submissions,"Uplifting, Depressing, and Tilting Dark Energy",Eric V. Linder,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Current data in the form of baryon acoustic oscillation, supernova, and cosmic microwave background distances prefer a cosmology that accelerates more strongly than $\Lambda$CDM at $z\approx0.5-1.5$, and more weakly at $z\lesssim0.5$. We examine dark energy physics that can accommodate this, showing that interactions (decays, coupling to matter, nonminimal coupling to gravity) fairly generically tend not to give a satisfactory solution (in terms of fitting both distances and growth) even if they enable the effective dark energy equation of state to cross $w=-1$. To fit the cosmological data it appears the dark energy by itself must cross $w=-1$, a highly unusual physical behavior.",
New submissions,Nonminimal infrared gravitational reheating in light of ACT,"Ayan Chakraborty,Debaprasad Maity,Rajesh Mondal",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Inflation is known to produce large infrared scalar fluctuations. Further, if a scalar field $(\chi)$ is non-minimally coupled with gravity through $\xi \chi^2 R$, those infrared modes experience \textit{tachyonic instability} during and after inflation. Those large non-perturbative infrared modes can collectively produce hot Big Bang universe upon their horizon entry during the post-inflationary period. We indeed find that for reheating equation of state (EoS), $w_{\phi} > 1/3$, and coupling strength, $\xi>1/6$, large infrared fluctuations lead to successful reheating. We further analyze perturbative reheating by solving the standard Boltzmann equation in both Jordan and Einstein frames, and compare the results with the non-perturbative ones. Finally, embedding this infrared reheating scenario into the well-known $\alpha-$attractor inflationary model, we examine possible constraints on the model parameters in light of the latest ACT, DESI results. To arrive at the constraints, we take into account the latest bounds on tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{0.05}\leq 0.038$, isocurvature power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{S}} \lesssim 8.3\times 10^{-11}$, and effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.17 $. Subject to these constraints, we find successful reheating to occur only for EoS $w_{\phi}\gtrsim 0.6$, which translates to a sub-class of $\alpha-$attractor models being favored and placing them within the 2$\sigma$ region in the $ n_s-r$ plane of the latest ACT, DESI data. In this range of EoS, we find that the coupling strength should lie within $2.11\lesssim\xi\lesssim 2.95$ for $w_{\phi}=0.6$. Finally, we compute secondary gravitational wave signals induced by the scalar infrared modes, which are found to be strong enough to be detected by future GW observatories, namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.",
New submissions,A Bayesian PINN Framework for Barrow-Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy with Neutrinos: Toward a Resolution of the Hubble Tension,"Muhammad Yarahmadi,Amin Salehi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the Barrow-Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (BTHDE) model using both traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework, employing a range of cosmological observations. Our analysis incorporates data from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), CMB lensing, Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation. We focus on constraining the Hubble constant $ H_0 $, the nonextensive entropy index $ q $, the Barrow exponent $ \Delta $, and the Granda-Oliveros parameters $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $, along with the total neutrino mass $ \Sigma m_\nu $. The Bayesian PINN approach yields more precise constraints than MCMC, particularly for $ \beta $, and tighter upper bounds on $ \Sigma m_\nu $. The inferred values of $ H_0 $ from both methods lie between those from Planck 2018 and SH$_0$ES (R22), alleviating the Hubble tension to within $ 1.3\sigma $-$2.1\sigma $ depending on the dataset combination. Notably, the Bayesian PINN achieves consistent results across CC and Pantheon+ datasets, while maintaining physical consistency via embedded differential constraints. The combination of CMB and late-time probes leads to the most stringent constraints, with $ \Sigma m_\nu < 0.114 $ eV and $ H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.35 $ km/s/Mpc. These findings suggest that the BTHDE model provides a viable framework for addressing cosmological tensions and probing modified entropy scenarios, while highlighting the complementary strengths of machine learning and traditional Bayesian inference in cosmological modeling.",
New submissions,Caustic fringes for wave dark matter,"Andrew Eberhardt,Lam Hui",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.",
New submissions,Active galactic nuclei through the prism of galaxy clusters: bounds on axion-like particles,"Denys Malyshev,Lidiia Zadorozhna,Yuriy Bidasyuk,Andrea Santangelo,Oleg Ruchayskiy",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs) are of interest because of their potential to act as dark matter or to reveal information about yet undiscovered fundamental constituents of matter. Such particles can be created when photons traverse regions of magnetic fields. The conversion probability depends on both the magnetic field parameters and photon energy, leading to multiple spectral absorption features as light passes through magnetized regions.Traditionally, astrophysical searches have focused on detecting such features in individual objects. However, the limited understanding of properties of cosmic magnetic fields have hindered the progress. Here we introduce a new approach by analyzing stacked (rather than individual) spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) positioned behind galaxy clusters -- gigantic magnetic field reservoirs. Stacking efficiently averages over the uncertainties in magnetic fields, revealing a unique step-like spectral signature of photon-to-ALP conversion.With this approach we advance into previously inaccessible regions of the ALP parameter space for nano-electronvolt masses. Adopting this method will significantly improve existing bounds across a wide range of masses by using different telescopes and increasing the size of the stacked datasets. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, in particular, will extensively probe the parameter space where ALPs could serve as dark matter.",
New submissions,Probing Dark Matter Spike with Gravitational Waves from Early EMRIs in the Milky Way Center,"Chen Feng,Yong Tang,Yue-Liang Wu",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Cold dark matter may form dense structures around supermassive black holes (SMBHs), significantly influencing their local environments. These dense regions are ideal sites for the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which stellar-mass compact objects gradually spiral into SMBH, emitting gravitational waves (GWs). Space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories such as LISA and Taiji will be sensitive to these signals, including early-stage EMRIs (E-EMRIs) that persist in the low-frequency band for extended periods. In this work, we investigate the impact of dark matter-induced dynamical friction on E-EMRIs in the Milky Way Center, model its effect on the trajectory, and calculate the resulting modifications to the GW spectrum. Our analysis suggests that this influence might be sizable and lead to detectable deviations in the spectrum, namely suppression at low frequencies and enhancement at high frequencies, therefore providing a potential probe for dark matter with future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.",
New submissions,SPINN: Advancing Cosmological Simulations of Fuzzy Dark Matter with Physics Informed Neural Networks,"Ashutosh Kumar Mishra,Emma Tolley",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving differential equations by integrating physical laws into the learning process. This work leverages PINNs to simulate gravitational collapse, a critical phenomenon in astrophysics and cosmology. We introduce the Schrödinger-Poisson informed neural network (SPINN) which solve nonlinear Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equations to simulate the gravitational collapse of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) in both 1D and 3D settings. Results demonstrate accurate predictions of key metrics such as mass conservation, density profiles, and structure suppression, validating against known analytical or numerical benchmarks. This work highlights the potential of PINNs for efficient, possibly scalable modeling of FDM and other astrophysical systems, overcoming the challenges faced by traditional numerical solvers due to the non-linearity of the involved equations and the necessity to resolve multi-scale phenomena especially resolving the fine wave features of FDM on cosmological scales.",
New submissions,Euclid preparation. Constraining parameterised models of modifications of gravity with the spectroscopic and photometric primary probes,Euclid Collaboration,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Euclid mission has the potential to understand the fundamental physical nature of late-time cosmic acceleration and, as such, of deviations from the standard cosmological model, LCDM. In this paper, we focus on model-independent methods to modify the evolution of scalar perturbations at linear scales. We consider two approaches: the first is based on the two phenomenological modified gravity (PMG) parameters, $\mu_{\rm mg}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm mg}$, which are phenomenologically connected to the clustering of matter and weak lensing, respectively; and the second is the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy and modified gravity, which we use to parameterise the braiding function, $\alpha_{\rm B}$, which defines the mixing between the metric and the dark energy field. We discuss the predictions from spectroscopic and photometric primary probes by Euclid on the cosmological parameters and a given set of additional parameters featuring the PMG and EFT models. We use the Fisher matrix method applied to spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp), weak lensing (WL), photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), and cross-correlation (XC) between GCph and WL. For the modelling of photometric predictions on nonlinear scales, we use the halo model to cover two limits for the screening mechanism: the unscreened (US) case, for which the screening mechanism is not present; and the super-screened (SS) case, which assumes strong screening. We also assume scale cuts to account for our uncertainties in the modelling of nonlinear perturbation evolution. We choose a time-dependent form for $\{\mu_{\rm mg},\Sigma_{\rm mg}\}$, with two fiducial sets of values for the corresponding model parameters at the present time, $\{\bar{\mu}_0,\bar{\Sigma}_0\}$, and two forms for $\alpha_{\rm B}$, with one fiducial set of values for each of the model parameters, $\alpha_{\rm B,0}$ and $\{\alpha_{\rm B,0},m\}$.

New submissions,Scatter in the star formation rate-halo mass relation: secondary bias and its impact on line-intensity mapping,"Rui Lan Jun(UTokyo),Tom Theuns(ICC, Durham),Kana Moriwaki(UTokyo),Sownak Bose(ICC, Durham)",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the impact of secondary bias -- specifically, the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and halo bias at fixed halo mass -- on the line-intensity mapping (LIM) power spectrum. In LIM, the galaxy contributions are flux-weighted, and for many emission lines (e.g., H$\alpha$), flux scales with SFR. We show that the (ensemble-averaged) large-scale two-halo term of the power spectrum depends only on the mean luminosity-halo mass relation if the scatter is uncorrelated with halo bias. However, when luminosity correlates with halo bias at fixed mass, this assumption breaks down. In IllustrisTNG, this secondary bias increases the two-halo term by 5 per cent at $z \sim 1.5$ compared to a model with random scatter. We also find that SFRs of central and satellite galaxies are correlated, enhancing the one-halo term -- sensitive to intra-halo SFR distribution -- by 10 per cent relative to random pairings. To mitigate secondary bias in the two-halo term, we identify halo concentration (for haloes with mass $\log M_h \lesssim 12$) and satellite mass (for $\log M_h \gtrsim 12$) as effective secondary parameters. These results highlight the need to account for secondary bias when building mock catalogues and interpreting LIM observations.",
New submissions,TDCOSMO 2025: Cosmological constraints from strong lensing time delays,"Simon Birrer,Elizabeth J. Buckley-Geer,Michele Cappellari,Frederic Courbin,Frederic Dux,Christopher D. Fassnacht,Joshua A. Frieman,Aymeric Galan,Daniel Gilman,Xiang-Yu Huang,Shawn Knabel,Danial Langeroodi,Huan Lin,Martin Millon,Takahiro Morishita,Veronica Motta,Pritom Mozumdar,Eric Paic,Anowar J. Shajib,William Sheu,Dominique Sluse,Alessandro Sonnenfeld,Chiara Spiniello,Massimo Stiavelli,Sherry H. Suyu,Chin Yi Tan,Tommaso Treu,Lyne Van de Vyvere,Han Wang,Patrick Wells,Devon M. Williams,Kenneth C. Wong",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with $\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find $H_0=72.1^{+4.0}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on $H_0$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM to 4.4%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\phi}$CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.",
New submissions,EIGER VII. The evolving relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium in the final stages of reionization,"Daichi Kashino,Simon J. Lilly,Jorryt Matthee,Ruari Mackenzie,Anna-Christina Eilers,Rongmon Bordoloi,Robert A. Simcoe,Rohan P. Naidu,Minghao Yue,Bin Liu",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the late stages of cosmic reionization, based on the complete JWST EIGER dataset. Using deep NIRCam $3.5\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ slitless spectroscopy, we construct a sample of 948 [\OIII]$\lambda5008$-emitting galaxies with $-21.4\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV}\lesssim -17.2$ spanning $5.33<z<6.97$ along six quasar sightlines. We correlate these galaxies with \Lya\ and \Lyb\ transmission measured from high-resolution quasar spectra across multiple redshift intervals. We find clear redshift evolution in the correlation between galaxy density and transmission: it is suppressed in overdense regions at $z<5.50$, while enhanced at $5.70<z<6.15$. The intermediate range exhibits a transitional behavior. Cross-correlation measurements further reveal excess absorption within $\sim 8$\,cMpc of galaxies at low redshifts, and enhanced transmission at intermediate scales ($\sim$5--20\,cMpc) at $z>5.70$. Statistical tests using mock catalogs with realistic galaxy clustering but no correlation with the transmission field confirm that the observed correlations are unlikely to arise by chance. The evolving signals can be explained by stronger absorption in overdense regions, combined with the competing influences of local radiation fields and the rising background radiation. While local radiation dominates ionization of the surrounding IGM at earlier times, the background becomes increasingly important, eventually surpassing the impact of nearby galaxies. These results support an inside-out progression of reionization, with ionized regions originating around clustered, star-forming galaxies and gradually extending into underdense regions.",
Cross submissions,"Evolution of Wormholes under f(R, T) Theory, the Karmarkar Condition and the Casimir Energy",Murat Metehan Turkoglu,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this study, both the evolution of wormholes (by examining both the energy conditions and using the TOV equations) and the effects of the Karmarkar condition on the solutions obtained under certain specific cases were examined in the light of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory, using two $f(R,T)$ functions predicted to describe the accelerated expansion of the universe. In this context, for the first time in the literature, a generalized shape function was obtained using the Karmarkar condition. It was observed that solutions of the type $R-a_{1}^2/R+a_{2}g(T)$ satisfy the energy conditions (with the dominant energy condition being partially satisfied), whereas solutions of the type $R+a_{1}^2R^2+a_{2}g(T)$ require the presence of exotic matter. In both cases, stable, static, and traversable wormhole solutions were obtained. By applying the Karmarkar condition to the $R+a_{1}^2R^2+a_{2}g(T)$ type solutions, which violate the energy conditions, the relationship between wormhole geometry and energy conditions was investigated. The study examined whether the Karmarkar condition eliminates the need for exotic matter, and it was found that the solutions do not remove the necessity of exotic matter. Additionally, it was demonstrated that a specific value of the parameter, ${\beta}$, which determines the radial variation of the shape function, could ensure the stability of the wormhole throat with the aid of Casimir energy. In other words, it is considered possible that the geometric evolution of the wormhole throat could trigger the transition from positive energy (baryonic matter) to negative energy (dark matter, dark energy, or other exotic matter) by inducing Casimir forces.",
Cross submissions,Blast-frozen Dark Matter and Modulated Density Perturbations,"Miha Nemevšek,Yue Zhang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"First-order phase transitions (FOPT) are ubiquitous in beyond the Standard Model physics and leave distinctive echoes in the history of early universe. We consider a FOPT serving the well-motivated role of dark matter mass generation and present {\it blast-frozen dark matter} (BFDM), which transitions from radiation to non-relativistic relic in a period much shorter than the corresponding Hubble time. Its cosmological imprint are strong oscillations in the dark matter density perturbations that seed structure formation on large and small scales. For a FOPT occurring not long before the matter-radiation equality, next generation cosmological surveys bear a strong potential to discover BFDM and in turn establish the origin of dark matter mass.",
Cross submissions,Dynamical Dark Energy from $F(R)$ Gravity Models Unifying Inflation with Dark Energy: Confronting the Latest Observational Data,"S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou,G.S. Sharov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A class of viable $F(R)$ gravity models which can provide a unified description of inflation with the dark energy era is confronted with the latest observational data on the dark energy era. These models have the unique characteristic that the de Sitter scalaron mass in the Einstein frame counterpart theory is a monotonic function of the curvature, which renders them viable descriptions for both the inflationary and the late-time acceleration eras. We also compare these models with other well-known viable $F(R)$ gravity models and with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. As we show, the most phenomenologically successful models are those which deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. Also some of the models presented, provide a statistically favorable description of the dark energy eras, compared with the exponential $F(R)$ gravity model and of course compared with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. All the models we present in this article are confronted with the observational data from the Planck collaboration, the Pantheon plus data from Type Ia supernovae, the two rounds of observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, data from baryon acoustic oscillations and the Hubble constant measurements by SH0ES group. As we show, two of the models are statistically favorable by the data.",
Cross submissions,Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation,"Hing-Tong Cho,Kin-Wang Ng",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.",
Cross submissions,On the Phase-Magnitude Relation in Gravitational Lensing: Reformulation and Applications of the Kramers-Kronig relation,"Teruaki Suyama,Shasvath J. Kapadia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"It is known that the amplification factor, defined as the ratio of the lensed to the unlensed waveform in the frequency domain, satisfies the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relation, which connects the real and imaginary parts of the amplification factor for any lensing signal. In this work, we reformulate the KK relation in terms of the magnitude and phase of the amplification factor. Unlike the original formulation, the phase cannot be uniquely determined from the magnitude alone due to the possible presence of a Blaschke product. While this ambiguity does not arise in the case of a point-mass lens, it can appear in more complex lens models, such as those with an NFW lens profile. As an application of our formulation, we demonstrate that the leading-order behavior of the phase in the low-frequency regime is completely determined by the leading-order behavior of the magnitude in the same regime. This reproduces known results from the literature, derived via low-frequency expansions for specific lens models. Importantly, our result does not rely on any particular lens model, highlighting a universal feature that the low-frequency behavior of the amplification factor is tightly constrained by the KK relation. As a further application, we present two examples in which the phase is constructed from a given analytic form of the magnitude using the newly derived KK relation. In particular, the second example allows for an analytic evaluation of the KK integral, yielding an explicit expression for the phase. This study offers a potentially powerful method for applying the KK relation in model-agnostic searches for lensing signals.",

Fischer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas),"We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.",
Cross submissions,About electroweak domain walls in Majoron models,Maximilian Berbig,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Some time ago it was claimed in ""Spontaneous Breaking of Lepton Number and Cosmological Domain Wall Problem"" (Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 151301 (2019)) that non perturbative instantons of the weak interaction $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$ lead to the formation of domain walls in Majoron models owing to the anomaly of the spontaneously broken global lepton number $L$ symmetry $\text{U}(1)_L$ with respect to $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$. We point out that it has long been known, that this effect can be completely rotated away unless there is a source of explicit $B+L$ breaking present, where $B$ denotes baryon number. We further estimate the tiny instanton induced Majoron mass from $B+L$ breaking and analyze the cosmological impact of such domain walls including possible finite temperature effects. In general this scenario does not lead to a cosmological catastrophe.",
