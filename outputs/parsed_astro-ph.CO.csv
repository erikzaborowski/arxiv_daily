New submissions,Spatial Phonons: A Phenomenological Viscous Dark Energy Model for DESI,Muhammad Ghulam Khuwajah Khan,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore a phenomenological model of dark energy in which space is treated as an elastic brane with uniform tension $T_s$ supporting a longitudinal phonon fluid. The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $\phi^I$ and an invariant $b = \sqrt{\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\kappa$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = \kappa/\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $\tau(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $H\tau(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \sim H_\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $\Lambda$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $\kappa \ \simeq \ \varepsilon \ \simeq \ 1/3$ and $H_\star/H_0 \ \simeq \ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements.",
New submissions,General-Relativistic Path Effects and the Local Hubble Expansion,Said Laaroua,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop an effective mapping for low-redshift photon propagation that captures the leading path-dependent deviations from the standard FLRW redshift. Instead of relying on exact integrations of the Sachs optical equations, we introduce a minimal deformation of the redshift relation z_eff(z) = z minus alpha times f(z), where alpha is a small amplitude and f(z) suppresses the correction at z greater than approximately 0.1. This mapping does not modify the background expansion but encapsulates the leading contribution of inhomogeneous tidal fields to the accumulated Sachs redshift. We derive the implications for the luminosity distance, the low-redshift Hubble relation, and the directional dependence associated with local structure. The framework provides a clean general-relativistic description of path-dependent redshift drift and yields concrete predictions for forthcoming low-redshift surveys.",
New submissions,The role of prompt cusps in driving the core collapse of SIDM halos,"Vinh Tran,Daniel Gilman,M. Sten Delos,Xuejian Shen,Oliver Zier,Mark Vogelsberger,David Xu",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Prompt cusps (PCs) form from the direct collapse of overdensities in the early Universe, reside at the center of every dark matter halo, and have density profiles steeper than $r^{-1}$ NFW cusps. Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the evolution of isolated halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with massive PCs embedded at their centers, a scenario that could be realized in certain SIDM models with light mediators that predict a small-scale suppression of the linear matter power spectrum. We track the evolution of three equally concentrated $10^7\,{\rm{M}}_\odot$ halos, hosting PCs of various total masses, and quantify how the presence of a PC affects the processes of core formation and collapse. Early in the core-formation phase, halos with more prominent PCs exhibit a delayed evolution by a factor of $\sim 2$ due to smaller velocity dispersion gradients in the inner region. During most of the core-collapse phase, the halo evolution becomes closely aligned in physical time, with appropriate rescaling of densities, radii, and velocity dispersions. The scale densities and radii preserve the virial mass of the original halos, but with increased concentration. Deviations occur at the late phase of core-collapse at the level of $\sim 5\%$ relative to the reference collapse track of an NFW halo. These deviations depend non-trivially on both the increased concentration incurred by the PCs, as well as the velocity dispersion (temperature) of the outer halo regions, which can inhibit or enhance the heat transfer process. Our simulations illustrate the complex interplay between the inner and outer halo profiles in determining the onset of core collapse and motivate future studies in the full cosmological context.",
New submissions,Dynamical Heating from Dark Compact Objects and Axion Minihalos: Implications for the 21-cm Signal,"Badal Bhalla,Aurora Ireland,Hongwan Liu,Huangyu Xiao,Tao Xu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The temperature of baryons at the end of the cosmic dark ages can be inferred from observations of the 21-cm hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen. Any energy injection from the dark sector can therefore be detected through these measurements. Dark compact objects and dark-matter substructures can modify the baryon temperature by transferring heat via dynamical friction. In this work, we evaluate the prospects for detecting dynamical friction-induced heating from dark compact objects with a mass in the range $10^2 M_{\odot}$ to $10^5 M_{\odot}$, as well as from axion minihalos, using upcoming 21-cm experiments. We find that both the 21-cm global signal and power-spectrum measurements will be sensitive to dark compact objects that constitute about 10% of the dark matter, and will substantially improve our sensitivity to axion-like particles with masses in the range $10^{-18}$ eV to $10^{-9}$ eV.",
New submissions,Probing Fuzzy Dark Matter in the 21 cm Signal via Wavelet Scattering Transform,"Hayato Shimabukuro,Shihang Liu,Bohua Li",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore the imprints of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on the redshifted 21~cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization by employing the wavelet scattering transform (WST). FDM, composed of ultralight scalar particles with masses $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} \sim 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, exhibits quantum pressure that suppresses the formation of small-scale structures below the de~Broglie wavelength, thereby delaying star formation and modifying the thermal history of the intergalactic medium. Using modified \texttt{21cmFAST} simulations that incorporate both linear and nonlinear effects of FDM on structure formation, we analyze the two-dimensional 21~cm brightness temperature fields through the first- and second-order WST coefficients. The first-order coefficients, $S_1(j)$, quantify scale-dependent variance analogous to the power spectrum, while the normalized second-order ratio $R(j_1,j_2)=S_2/S_1$ captures non-Gaussian cross-scale couplings. We find that low-order couplings, particularly between large and intermediate scales, are highly sensitive to the FDM particle mass and remain robust under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise. Quantitatively, the WST coefficients yield pairwise distances of $\Delta \simeq 225$ between CDM and FDM with $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}=10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, demonstrating that this framework can effectively discriminate between wave-like and cold dark matter scenarios even under realistic observational conditions. Our results establish the WST as a powerful, noise-tolerant statistical tool for probing the wave nature of dark matter through forthcoming 21~cm observations.",
New submissions,The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: A comprehensive X-ray analysis of the Hydra I galaxy cluster,"Alpish Srivastava,Thomas H. Reiprich,Angie Veronica,Florian Pacaud,Jakob Dietl,Fiona Knies,Manami Sasaki",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The Hydra I galaxy cluster (Abell 1060) is a nearby example of a low-temperature cluster that exhibits intermediate cool core and non-cool core properties. We aim to extend the characterization of the intracluster medium (ICM) properties at least until $R_{200}$ and study the correlation between the X-ray emission and non-thermal emission within $R=0.15$$R_{500}$, and optical/IR galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. We used data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys and an archival Chandra observation to image the X-ray emission from Abell 1060. We also used multiwavelength data from TGSS (radio), 2MASS (IR), and NED (optical) to investigate the non-thermal emission, 2D galaxy distribution, and its redshift evolution, respectively. The surface brightness and spectral analyses are also extended until 3$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$, respectively, following a detailed cosmic X-ray background (CXB) analysis. Our fully corrected eROSITA image showcases a relaxed ICM morphology within $R_{500}$. We detect two weak ICM shocks with Mach number $M\approx 1.5$ near the central galaxy NGC 3311 that coincide with diffuse radio emission along the line of sight. Furthermore, we detect multiple soft X-ray excesses with high spatial correlation with the 2D optical galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. In particular, the excess in the north has a significance of $5.8\sigma$ above the local CXB level. This suggests that Abell 1060's outskirts are actively accreting baryons. We also estimate the average ICM temperature and metallicity of $\langle k_\mathrm{B}T \rangle=2.27\substack{+0.15\\-0.11}\thinspace$ keV and $\langle Z\rangle=0.19\substack{+0.05\\-0.03}\thinspace Z_\odot$, respectively, from the 0.2-0.5$R_{500}$ annulus. Overall, the temperature profile is broadly consistent with the average temperature profiles from hydrodynamical simulation and Suzaku between 0.28$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$.",
New submissions,Normal or transitional? The evolution and properties of two type Ia supernovae in the Virgo cluster,"L. Izzo,C. Gall,N. Khetan,N. Earl,J. Hjorth,W. B. Hoogendam,Y. Q. Ni,A.

Rojas-Bravo,M. Siebert,S. J. Smartt,K. W. Smith,S. Srivastav,J. J. Swift,K. Taggart,G. Terreran,S. Thorp,L. Tomasella,R. J. Wainscoat",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are among the most precise cosmological distance indicators used to study the expansion history of the Universe. The vast increase of SN Ia data due to large-scale astrophysical surveys has led to the discovery of a wide variety of SN Ia sub-classes, such as transitional and fast-declining SNe Ia. However, their distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties differentiate them from the population of normal SNe Ia such that their use as cosmological tools remains challenged. Here, we present a high-cadenced photometric and spectroscopic dataset of two SNe Ia, SNe 2020ue and 2020nlb, which were discovered in the nearby Virgo cluster of galaxies. Our study shows that SN 2020nlb is a normal SN Ia whose unusually red color is intrinsic, arising from a lower photospheric temperature rather than interstellar reddening, providing clear evidence that color diversity among normal SNe Ia can have a physical origin. In contrast, SN 2020ue has photometric properties, such as color evolution and light-curve decay rate, similar to those of transitional SNe, spectroscopically it is more aligned with normal SNe Ia. This is evident from spectroscopic indicators such as the pseudo-equivalent width of \ion{Si}{II} lines. Thus, such SNe Ia that are photometrically at the edge of the standard normal SNe Ia range may be missed in cosmological SNe Ia samples. Our results highlight that spectroscopic analysis of SNe Ia around peak brightness is crucial for identifying intrinsic color variations and constructing a more complete and physically homogeneous SN Ia sample for precision cosmology.",
New submissions,Constraints on Chiral-Quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 and impact on unifying dark energy with inflation,"Andronikos Paliathanasis,Tommaso Mengoni,Genly Leon,Orlando Luongo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The recent data release DR2 from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has reinforced compelling evidence supporting the dynamical nature of dark energy. In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics.",
New submissions,Controlling weak-lensing shear biases from undetected galaxies in the era of Stage IV Surveys,Lisa M Voigt,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational lensing of background galaxies by intervening matter is a powerful probe of the cosmological model. In the era of Stage IV surveys, contamination from galaxies below the detection threshold has emerged as a significant source of bias. Adopting a noise-bias-free machine-learning method to estimate shear, we quantify the impact of faint galaxies for a Euclid-like survey. In our baseline simulations, faint blends induce a multiplicative shear bias of -0.008, well above Euclid's requirement. Similar to previous studies, we find that calibration simulations must include neighbouring galaxies to AB apparent magnitudes as faint as 27.0 (+2.1, -0.9) and within approximately 1.0 (+0.2, -0.2) arcsec of each bright sample galaxy (BSG; the galaxy for which shear is measured). By varying faint galaxy properties, we identify which ones significantly affect shear biases and quantify how well they must be constrained. Crucially, we find that biases not only depend on the mean projected faint-galaxy density and apparent-magnitude distribution across the sample, but also on how these quantities vary with the observed brightness of the BSG. Furthermore, biases are sensitive to radial and tangential alignments and positional anisotropy of faint galaxies relative to BSGs. By contrast, shear coherence between BSGs and faint galaxies, parallel orientation alignments, and variations in the faint galaxy size-magnitude relation have negligible impact within the parameter ranges explored. Our results guide calibration simulations and highlight the critical role of deep observations in measuring the properties of faint galaxies.",
New submissions,Green Bean galaxies and the fading echoes of AGN activity,"A. Arshinova,K. Sanderson,A. Moiseev",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Green Bean is a rare type of galaxy which represents a short-lived phase in the life cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN), characterised by large-scale, powerful ionised clouds in the circumgalactic medium. Recent studies demonstrate that these extended ionised structures may reflect fading signatures of past AGN activity, often manifested in the form of large-scale ionisation cones. The analysis of their observational properties provides unique constraints on AGN lifetimes, feedback mechanisms, and transitions between radiative and kinetic modes of activity. In this paper we announce the first results of the project dedicated to the long-slit spectroscopic and scanning Fabry-Perot interferometric observations of Green Bean galaxies at the Russian 6-m telescope with SCORPIO-2 multi-mode instrument. We describe the data reduction and spectral fitting procedures that allow one to characterise ionisation conditions in extended gaseous regions of the galaxy SDSSJ095100.54+051026.7.",
New submissions,"Investigating the Correlation between Dark Matter Content, Ages and Mass-to-Light Ratios in Spiral Galaxies","Arpit Kottur,Meet Mehta,Raka Dabhade",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present an empirical investigation into the relationship between galactic age and dark matter content across a sample of 16 nearby, well-resolved spiral galaxies. Using raw rotation curve data from IOA Tokyo's publicly available repository, we model each galaxy's mass distribution via a three-component decomposition (Hernquist bulge, exponential disk, and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo) fit using Monte Carlo simulations. The onset of dark matter dominance was identified using the NFW scale radius, beyond which we computed the total enclosed mass via Keplerian dynamics. I-band luminosities for these regions were estimated using a calibrated Tully-Fisher relation, yielding precise mass-to-light (M/L) ratios. We further calculated dark matter mass and density using NFW profile equations, and galaxy ages were retrieved through an extensive literature survey of stellar population studies.Our analysis reveals strong positive correlations between galactic age and both dark matter mass (Pearson $r \approx 0.91$; Spearman $\rho \approx 0.93$) and density (Pearson $r \approx 0.91$; Spearman $\rho \approx 0.91$), as well as M/L ratios, suggesting a robust link between evolutionary history and dark matter build-up. These findings are in quantitative agreement with predictions from large-scale cosmological simulations that incorporate assembly bias and smooth accretion-dominated growth, reinforcing the view that older galaxies, having formed earlier in high-density peaks, have accumulated significantly more dark matter over cosmic time. Our results offer observational evidence for time-dependent dark matter assembly and establish galactic age as a meaningful tracer of halo evolution.",

Tucker,A. R. Walker,N. Weaverdyck",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Over the last decade, the Australian Dark Energy (OzDES) collaboration has used Reverberation Mapping to measure the masses of high redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range $z\in [0.13, 3.85]$ and bolometric luminosity range $\log_{10}(L_{\mathrm{bol}})\in [44.3, 47.5] \mathrm{erg/s}$. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the Hbeta and MgII lines with a scatter of $\sim0.25$ dex, the tightest and most robust fit yet identified. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emitting regions, and find evidence that the MgII emission may occur further out than Hbeta. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and the most reliable radius-luminosity relations to date.",
New submissions,Joint Constraints on Fuzzy and Warm Dark Matter from Satellite Populations of the Milky Way and Andromeda,"Jianxiang Liu,Yan Gong,Kai Liao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We perform a joint analysis of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) satellite populations to constrain the properties of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM). We combine MW satellite observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) with M31 satellite data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), and model the corresponding observable satellite populations using the galaxy--halo connection model together with the appropriate selection functions. Uncertainties in the virial masses of the MW and M31 are incorporated through host-mass priors that linearly scale the relevant model parameters, allowing us to infer the full posterior distributions of all parameters. For the FDM case, we obtain $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} > 1.75 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (95% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} > 1.41 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio). For thermal-relic WDM, we find $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} > 6.22~\mathrm{keV}$ (95% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} > 5.75~\mathrm{keV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio). These results represent a moderate improvement over MW-only constraints, and provide the strongest constraints to date on the FDM and WDM derived from satellite galaxy populations in the Local Group.",
New submissions,Accurate cosmological emulator for the probability distribution function of gravitational lensing of point sources,"Tunç Türker,Valerio Marra,Tiago Castro,Miguel Quartin,Stefano Borgani",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We develop an accurate and computationally efficient emulator to model the gravitational lensing magnification probability distribution function (PDF), enabling robust cosmological inference of point sources such as supernovae and gravitational-wave observations. We construct a pipeline utilizing cosmological $N$-body simulations, creating past light cones to compute convergence and shear maps. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed for dimensionality reduction, followed by an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model to interpolate magnification PDFs across a broad cosmological parameter space ($\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, $w$, $h$) and redshift range ($0.2 \le z \le 6$). We identify the optimal number of PCA components to balance accuracy and stability. Our emulator, publicly released as ace_lensing, accurately reproduces lensing PDFs with a median Kullback-Leibler divergence of $0.007$. Validation on the test set confirmed that the model reliably reproduces the detailed shapes and statistical properties of the PDFs across the explored parameter range, showing no significant degradation for specific parameter combinations or redshifts. Future work will focus on incorporating baryonic physics through hydrodynamical simulations and expanding the training set to further enhance model accuracy and generalizability.",
New submissions,Analytical Emulator for the Baryon EoM inside the Fuzzy Dark Matter Soliton from Machine Learning,"Ke Wang,Jianbo Lu,Man Ho Chan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"An empirical baryon density profile can be included in the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equations to influence the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) soliton formation. However, to probe the effects of baryon on the other dynamical evolutions of the FDM soliton, its equation of motion (EoM) inside the corresponding FDM soliton is needed. In this paper, given an empirical baryon density profile, we first provide the cylinderical symmetric FDM soliton solution about the FDM density and the total potential of FDM and baryon. Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning. Finally, we check that this baryon EoM works as well as an empirical baryon density profile for the FDM soliton formation, with the fractional errors $\lesssim0.04$. It should also work well for some other simple FDM soliton evolutions.",
New submissions,Constraining Dark Acoustic Oscillations with the High-Redshift UV Luminosity Function,"Jared Barron,David Curtin,Hongwan Liu,Julian Munoz,Sandip Roy",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Dark acoustic oscillations (DAOs) in the matter power spectrum can arise in many different dark sector models, and can imprint on a variety of cosmological observables. In this work we use measurements of the galactic UV luminosity function (UVLF) at high redshifts to constrain the dark acoustic oscillation feature at small scales in a model-agnostic way. We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs. Using measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we constrain the wave number of the first DAO peak to be at $k \gtrsim 50\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$, unless the fraction of dark matter undergoing DAOs is less than $0.07$.",

We sample from the invariant Weil--Petersson (WP) measure using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and normalising flows on \Kahler moduli space with dimension up to $h^{1,1}=30$, and present results on the spectrum of the CY volume and properties of divisors when the measure is restricted in physically meaningful ways. We furthermore present a theory-informed prior on axion masses and decay constants $(m_a,f_a)$ marginalised over the WP measure for all inequivalent CYs constructable from the Kreuzer--Skarke database with $h^{1,1}\leq 5$. We then impose likelihoods based on axion physics. We demonstrate how detection of a relatively heavy QCD axion at small $h^{1,1}$, e.g. by ADMX, provides detailed information about CY geometry and topology. Finally, we compute a full forward model incorporating likelihoods from the cosmic microwave background and Lyman-alpha forest and find the maximum posterior probability region on the moduli space of a given CY favoured by a resolution of the tension in these data by an ultralight axion composing $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ of the dark matter.

The induced mass can be generated in a cosmologically relevant range to be the dark matter or dark energy of the universe for a reasonable and well-motivated range of the symmetry breaking scale. Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory. Finally, we find that, for late-time, astrophysical compact objects, cosmologically relevant gravi-axions behave as minimally-coupled, massive scalar fields.",
Cross submissions,Widen the Resonance at Ultra-High Energies: Novel Probes of Neutrino Self-interactions in the High-Mass Regime,"Pedro A. N. Machado,Isaac R. Wang,Xun-Jie Xu,Bei Zhou",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Neutrino self-interaction beyond the Standard Model is well motivated by the nonzero masses of neutrinos, which are the only known particles guaranteed to have new physics. Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \sim 10^{-3}$ -- up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds. Our results enhance the discovery potential of $\nu$SI in the high-mass regime, potentially offering crucial insights into the connections between the neutrino sector and dark sector.",

Characterized only by the scalar mass $\mu$ and the dark charge $q$, this framework naturally gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including stable solitonic configurations that behave as dark ""mini-MACHOs"". We numerically build and evolve these gauged scalar-field solitons, derive their mass-radius relations, and identify a critical charge beyond which no gravitationally bound configurations exist. By combining these results with microlensing surveys that exclude compact objects heavier than the asteroid-mass scale ($M\lesssim 10^{-11}M_\odot$), we obtain the constraint $\mu\gtrsim 10\,\rm eV$ for viable configurations, depending on $q$. Our results represent a step forward in showing that purely gravitational observations can constrain the internal parameters of a dark gauge sector, and provide a framework for exploring broader DSM scenarios through future probes such as gravitational wave detections.",

We introduce a model independent parameterization of double-peaked spectra based on the superposition of two normalized broken power laws and perform a Bayesian inference study using the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA isotropic cross-correlation data. While no statistically significant evidence for a multi-peak background is found, the analysis provides constraints on the inter-peak slopes in correlation with the signal amplitude. These results exhibit LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's ability to probe signals beyond a single peak structure and establish a foundation for future targeted searches for nontrivial gravitational waves background spectral shapes in future observing runs and the advanced detector era.",
Cross submissions,On extremal black holes,"Chiara Coviello,Ruth Gregory",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We take a fresh look at the viability of physically realistic extremal black holes within our (non-supersymmetric) low energy physics. By incorporating prefactors and volume effects, we show that Schwinger discharge in charge neutral environments is far more efficient than commonly assumed. Using ionization estimates for neutral hydrogen, we obtain a new and robust lower bound on the mass of an extremal electrically charged black hole, exceeding $10^{14} M_\odot$. For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible. Finally, we suggest that an extremal Kerr black hole could shed angular momentum via superradiant scattering from the stochastic gravitational wave background. Taken together, our results provide a unified picture that extremal black holes of any type are unlikely to persist in our universe.",
Cross submissions,Quantum Recoherence in Presence of Excited States in the Early Universe,"Mattia Cielo,Simone Scarlatella,Gianpiero Mangano,Ofelia Pisanti,Louis Hamaide",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the quantum-to-classical transition of primordial perturbations within a two-field inflationary framework where an adiabatic mode interacts with an entropic environment. In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum. This sensitivity to initial conditions highlights the non-generic nature of full recoherence in the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations.",
