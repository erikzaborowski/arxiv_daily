New submissions,From ANN to BNN: Inferring Reionization Parameters using Uncertainty-aware Emulators of 21-cm Summaries,"Yashrajsinh Mahida,Sanjay Kumar Yadav,Suman Majumdar,Leon Noble,Chandra Shekhar Murmu,Saswata Dasgupta,Sohini Dutta,Himanshu Tiwari,Abinash Kumar Shaw",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Inferring astrophysical parameters from radio interferometric observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a challenging yet crucial task. The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be highly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g., bispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for a varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many times, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge, many artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced, which produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN emulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus, they fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Therefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline, they cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated model parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural network (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the posterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their prediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference pipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock observation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW observation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty for the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the inference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced the training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN outperforms the ANN emulators. We also show that using the bispectrum as a summary statistic gives better constraints on EoR parameters than the power spectrum.",
New submissions,Field-level Reconstruction from Foreground-Contaminated 21-cm Maps,"Shu-Fan Chen,Kai-Feng Chen,Cora Dvorkin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Current and upcoming 21-cm experiments will soon be able to map 21-cm spatial fluctuations in three dimensions for a wide range of redshifts. However, bright foreground contamination and the nature of radio interferometry create significant challenges, making it difficult to access rich cosmological information from the Fourier modes that lie within the ""foreground wedge"". In this work, we introduce two approaches aiming to reconstruct the full 21-cm density field, including the missing modes in the wedge: (a) a field-level inference under an effective field theory (EFT) framework; (b) a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on simulations. Under the EFT framework, we implement a fully differentiable forward model that maps the initial conditions of matter fluctuations to the observed, foreground-filtered 21-cm maps. This enables a gradient-based sampler to simultaneously sample the initial conditions and bias parameters, allowing a physically motivated mode reconstruction. Alternatively, we apply a variational diffusion model to perform 21-cm density reconstruction at the map level. Our model is trained on semi-numerical simulations over a wide range of astrophysical parameters. Our results from both approaches should provide improved cosmological constraints from the field level and also enable cross-correlation between experiments that have little or no overlapping modes.",
New submissions,"A catalog to unite them all: REGALADE, a revised galaxy compilation for the advanced detector era","Hugo Tranin,Nadejda Blagorodnova,Marco A. Gómez-Muñoz,Maxime Wavasseur,Paul J. Groot,Lloyd Landsberg,Fiorenzo Stoppa,Steven Bloemen,Paul M. Vreeswijk,Daniëlle L.A. Pieterse,Jan van Roestel,Simone Scaringi,Sara Faris",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Many applications in transient science, gravitational wave follow-up, and galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys -- including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars, and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 20,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88\% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80\%. REGALADE is more than 90\% complete for massive galaxies out to 360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60\% more known supernova hosts, doubles the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable hosts for ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is the most complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe, built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be released to support broad community use.",
New submissions,Effective bias expansion for circumventing 21 cm foregrounds,"Wenzer Qin,Kai-Feng Chen,Katelin Schutz,Adrian Liu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) but suffers from contamination by spectrally smooth foregrounds, which obscure the large-scale signal along the line of sight. We explore the possibility of indirectly extracting the 21 cm signal in the presence of foregrounds by taking advantage of nonlinear couplings between large and small scales, both at the level of the density field and a biased tracer of that field. When combined with effective field theory techniques, bias expansions allow for a systematic treatment of nonlinear mode-couplings in the map between the underlying density field and the 21 cm field. We apply an effective bias expansion to density information generated with $\texttt{21cmFAST}$ using a variety of assumptions about which information can be recovered by different surveys and density estimation techniques. We find that the 21 cm signal produced by our effective bias expansion, combined with our least optimistic foreground assumptions, produces ~30% cross-correlations with the true 21 cm field. Providing complementary density information from high-redshift galaxy surveys yields a cross-correlation of 50-70%. The techniques presented here may be combined with foreground mitigation strategies in order to improve the recovery of the large-scale 21 cm signal.",
New submissions,Beyond the two-point correlation: constraining primordial non-gaussianity with density perturbation moments,"Ethan Vislosky,Zachery Brown,Regina Demina,Edmond Chaussidon",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Constraining primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) in the large-scale cosmic structure (LSS) is an important step in understanding properties of the early universe, specifically in distinguishing between different inflationary models. Measuring PNG relies on evaluating the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. New summary statistics beyond the two- and three-point correlation functions in configuration space and their Fourier-space counterparts, the power- and bi-spectrum may provide increased sensitivity. We introduce a new method for extracting the PNG signal imprinted on the LSS by using the first three Gaussian moments of the normalized correlation in density perturbations, evaluated at varying distance scales. We aim to assess this method's sensitivity to local PNG, parameterized by $f_ {\mathrm{NL}}$. We perform spherical convolutions at a range of scales on dark matter halo simulations to measure the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. From these, we compute the first three moments and compare them to a model expectation vector, parameterized to the second power in $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Our method provides about 21% improvement in sensitivity to $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ with respect to using the two point correlation function alone. Notably, we find that the second moment alone carries nearly as much constraining power as the mean, highlighting the potential of higher-order statistics. Given its simplicity and efficiency, this framework is well-suited for application to current and upcoming large-scale surveys such as DESI.",
New submissions,Three-Dimensional Polarimetric Structure of Jets from Radio Galaxy MRC 0600-399 in Abell 3376,"Haruka Sakemi,James O. Chibueze,William D. Cotton,Viral Parekh,Takumi Ohmura,Mami Machida,Taichi Igarashi,Takuya Akahori,Hiroki Akamatsu,Hiroyuki Nakanishi,Tsutomu T. Takeuchi",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"MRC 0600-399, in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3376, is one of the unique Head-Tail radio galaxies having abruptly bending structures, the origin of which is still under discussion. A previous study suggested that the interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the jet propagates the long distance keeping the sharp shape. In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600-399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L-band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed the Pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function 3D cube. MRC 0600-399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600-399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with the other observation, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.",
New submissions,Constraints on Compact Dark Matter Population from Micro-lensing Effect of Gravitational Wave for the third-generation gravitational Wave Detector,"Xin-Yi Lin,Xi-Jing Wang,Huan Zhou,Zhengxiang Li,Kai Liao,Zong-Hong Zhu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Since the pioneering detection of gravitational wave (GW) from a binary black hole merger by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, GW has become a powerful tool for probing astrophysics and cosmology. If compact dark matter (DM) candidates, e.g. primordial black holes, contribute a substantial fraction of the DM component across a broad mass spectrum, their gravitational influence would imprint distinctive micro-lensing signatures on long-wavelength GW signals. In this paper, we propose a systematic method ranging from simulating micro-lensing GWs to constraining population information of compact DM, combining future third-generation ground-based GW detector, i.e. Einstein Telescope, with a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. This approach enables us to analyze micro-lensing signatures in GW events and probe the potential contribution of compact DM objects to the DM budget of universe. For a population with a power-law mass function, we demonstrate that detecting 8 micro-lensing GW events out of $10^4$ observed binary black holes would constrain the compact DM abundance to $\log_{10}(f_{\rm CO})=-2.76^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$.",
New submissions,The Cosmic Dance: Observational Detection of Coherent Spin in Galaxy Clusters,"Xiao-xiao Tang,Peng Wang,Yu Rong,Weiguang cui",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The spin of galaxy clusters encodes key information about their formation, dynamics, and the influence of large-scale structure. However, whether clusters possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational statistical detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, by using a sample of 2,170 systems with $M > 10^{14}\, M_\odot$ selected from a publicly available group catalog based on the SDSS galaxy. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference ($\Delta Z_{\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a trial axis. We find strong statistical evidence for coherent rotation, with the observed $\Delta Z_{\rm max}$ distribution significantly exceeding randomized controls (nearly $\sim150\sigma$ confidence at $\sim380~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$), especially in richer clusters ($N_{\mathrm{gal}} > 10$, up to $\sim300\sigma$). Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\sim330~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{14} M_\odot$ to $\sim800~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\odot$. Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer systems. These results reveal significant coherent spin in galaxy clusters, shaped by both internal dynamics and large-scale structure.",
New submissions,The Milky Way is a less massive galaxy--new estimates of the Milky Way's local and global stellar masses,"Jianhui Lian(Yunnan Uni.),Tao Wang(Yunnan Uni.),Qikang Feng(Peking Uni.),Yang Huang(U of Chinese Academy of Sciences),Helong Guo(Yunnan Uni.)",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Stellar mass is the most fundamental property of a galaxy. While it has been robustly measured for millions of external galaxies, it remains poorly constrained for the Milky Way because of the strong selection effect from our inside perspective. In this work, we reconstruct the intrinsic vertical mass density profile in the solar neighborhood and the radial mass density profile across the entire Galaxy using data from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys, following careful correction for the selection function. The local density profile exhibits strong north-south asymmetry in the geometric thick disk regime and increases steeply toward the disk mid-plane, favoring an exponential model over the sech$^2$ model. Integrating the local vertical density profile yields a surface stellar mass density of 31.563$\pm$2.813(syst.)$\pm$0.024(stoch.)~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$, of which 25.074 and 6.489~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$ correspond to living stars and stellar remnants, respectively. The radial surface mass density profile {of the Milky Way} shares the same flat inner component as observed in the brightness profile. With this mass density profile {and local mass density from Gaia}, we derive a new estimate of the total stellar mass of the Milky Way of 2.607$\pm$0.353(syst.)$\pm$0.085(stoch.)${\rm \times10^{10}M_{\odot}}$, a factor of two lower than the previous results. This discrepancy arises primarily from the inner disk profile, which was previously unavailable and extrapolated from the outer disk profile. The lower stellar mass estimate of the Milky Way significantly reduces its rarity in terms of supermassive black hole mass among external galaxies and implies a larger dark matter-to-baryon mass ratio in the inner Galaxy.",
New submissions,Is Phantom Barrier Crossing Inevitable? A Cosmographic Analysis,"Nandan Roy,Soumya Chakrabarti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the evolution of dark energy using a model-independent framework based on the cosmographic approach. The main objective of this work is to construct a dynamical dark energy model directly from the kinematic equations of the cosmographic parameters, rather than adopting any arbitrary parametrization of the cosmological parameters. We employ the differential equation for the jerk parameter and map it to an anharmonic oscillator equation. From this, we derive an analytical expression for the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy. Interestingly, this form of the EoS depends on only a single parameter. Using the recently released DESI DR2 BAO data, Pantheon+ supernova dataset, and a compressed Planck likelihood, we constrain the cosmological parameters within this framework. Our results indicate a deviation from the cosmological constant behavior at late times, suggesting a dynamical nature of dark energy. Our findings contradict the DESI DR2 analysis based on the CPL parametrization, as no phantom-barrier crossing is observed in our analysis. This study highlights that model-independent reconstructions rooted in kinematical quantities can provide robust insights into the true nature of dark energy.",
New submissions,Narrowing the discovery space of the cosmological 21-cm signal using multi-wavelength constraints,"Jiten Dhandha,Anastasia Fialkov,Thomas Gessey-Jones,Harry T. J. Bevins,Sandro Tacchella,Simon Pochinda,Eloy de Lera Acedo,Saurabh Singh,Rennan Barkana",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The cosmic 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the early Universe, owing to its sensitivity to the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) and properties of the first luminous sources. In this work, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties by leveraging multi-wavelength synergies. This builds on our earlier study, where we developed the synergy between high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), 21-cm global signal non-detection from SARAS~3, and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, to constrain the astrophysical properties of Population II galaxies. Through a combination of CXB and HERA data, we find the IGM kinetic temperature to be $T_\text{K}(z=15)\lesssim 7.7~\text{K}$, $2.5~\text{K} \lesssim T_\text{K}(z=10) \lesssim 66~\text{K}$, and $20~\text{K}\lesssim T_\text{K}(z=6) \lesssim 2078~\text{K}$ at 95\% credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data place an upper limit on the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving $T_\text{rad}(z=15) \lesssim 47~\text{K}$, $T_\text{rad}(z=10)\lesssim 51~\text{K}$, and $T_\text{rad}(z=6)\lesssim 101~\text{K}$. These constraints, strengthened by the inclusion of UVLFs from HST and JWST, allow us to place the first \textit{lower bound} on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough of depth ${-201~\text{mK}\lesssim T_\text{21,min} \lesssim -68~\text{mK}}$ at $z_\text{min}\approx10-16$, and a power spectrum of $8.7~\text{mK}^2 < \Delta_{21}^2(z=15) < 197~\text{mK}^2$ at $k=0.35~h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. Our results provide promising predictions for upcoming 21-cm experiments, and highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early Universe.",
New submissions,The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations,Francesco Sylos Labini,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech),"Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.",

Samuroff,M. Smith,E. Suchyta,M. E. C. Swanson,D. Thomas,V. Vikram,J. Weller,M. Yamamoto",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a cosmological analysis of the third-order aperture mass statistic using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) data. We perform a complete tomographic measurement of the three-point correlation function of the Y3 weak lensing shape catalog with the four fiducial source redshift bins. Building upon our companion methodology paper, we apply a pipeline that combines the two-point function $\xi_{\pm}$ with the mass aperture skewness statistic $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$, which is an efficient compression of the full shear three-point function. We use a suite of simulated shear maps to obtain a joint covariance matrix. By jointly analyzing $\xi_\pm$ and $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ measured from DES Y3 data with a $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.780\pm0.015$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.266^{+0.039}_{-0.040}$, yielding 111% of figure-of-merit improvement in $\Omega_m$-$S_8$ plane relative to $\xi_{\pm}$ alone, consistent with expectations from simulated likelihood analyses. With a $w$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.749^{+0.027}_{-0.026}$ and $w_0=-1.39\pm 0.31$, which gives an improvement of $22\%$ on the joint $S_8$-$w_0$ constraint. Our results are consistent with $w_0=-1$. Our new constraints are compared to CMB data from the Planck satellite, and we find that with the inclusion of $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ the existing tension between the data sets is at the level of $2.3\sigma$. We show that the third-order statistic enables us to self-calibrate the mean photometric redshift uncertainty parameter of the highest redshift bin with little degradation in the figure of merit. Our results demonstrate the constraining power of higher-order lensing statistics and establish $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ as a practical observable for joint analyses in current and future surveys.",
New submissions,Cosmology from a joint analysis of second and third order shear statistics with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 data,"Sunao Sugiyama,Rafael C. H. Gomes,Bhuvnesh Jain",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a joint cosmological analysis of the two-point correlation function and the aperture-mass skewness measured from the Year 3 data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-Y3). The aperture-mass skewness is a compressed representation of three-point shear information, designed to capture non-Gaussian features while keeping the data vector computationally tractable. We find that including the aperture-mass skewness improves the $S_8$-$\Omega_m$ figure of merit by 80% compared to the 2PCF-only case, primarily due to the breaking of degeneracies. Our joint analysis yields a constraint of $S_8=0.736\pm0.020$, which is slightly lower than the two-point-only result and increases the tension with Planck 2018 to 3.2$\sigma$ in the $S_8$-$\Omega_m$ plane. The two- and three-point statistics are found to be internally consistent across redshift bins and angular scales, and we detect no significant intrinsic alignment signal. We also explore extensions to the $w$CDM model and find no evidence for deviations from a cosmological constant. This work demonstrates the feasibility and scientific value of incorporating third-order shear statistics into weak lensing cosmology and provides a practical pathway for similar analyses in future Stage-IV surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.",
New submissions,Data Compression with Noise Suppression for Inference under Noisy Covariance,"Sunao Sugiyama,Minsu Park",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"In many fields including cosmology, statistical inference often relies on Gaussian likelihoods whose covariance matrices are estimated from a finite number of simulations. This finite-sample estimation introduces noise into the covariance, which propagates to parameter estimates, a phenomenon known as the Dodelson-Schneider (DS) effect, leading to inflated uncertainties. While the Massively Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data compression (MOPED) algorithm offers lossless Fisher information-preserving compression, it does not mitigate the DS effect when the compression matrix itself is derived from noisy covariances. In this paper, we propose a modified compression scheme, powered MOPED ($p$-MOPED), which suppresses noise propagation by balancing information retention and covariance estimate noise reduction through a tunable power-law transformation of the sample correlation matrix. We test $p$-MOPED against standard and diagonal MOPED on toy models and on cosmological data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 weak lensing survey. Our results demonstrate that $p$-MOPED consistently outperforms other approaches, especially in regimes with limited simulations, offering a robust compression strategy for high-dimensional data analyses under practical constraints.",

The inelastic scattering of DM can produce unique signatures in the DM direct detection experiments. Using the low-energy unpaired ionization data from PandaX-4T, we newly analyze the probe of the exothermic inelastic dark matter (ineDM). We demonstrate that PandaX-4T can probe the ineDM mass-splitting down to 0.05 keV and probe the ineDM mass to the sub-GeV range. For the ineDM with a dark photon mediator, we use the PandaX-4T data to impose stringent bounds on the mixing parameter between the dark photon and photon.",
Cross submissions,Deformations of Starobinsky Inflation in No-Scale SU(5) and SO(10) GUTs,"John Ellis,Marcos A. G. Garcia,Natsumi Nagata,Dimitri V. Nanopoulos,Keith A. Olive",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The original Starobinsky $R + R^2$ model of inflation is consistent with Planck and other measurements of the CMB, but recent results from the ACT and SPT Collaborations hint that the tilt of scalar perturbations may be in tension with the prediction of the Starobinsky model. No-scale models of inflation can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model, but also provide a framework for incorporating deformations that could accommodate more easily the ACT and SPT data. We discuss this possibility in the contexts of SU(5) GUTs, taking into account the constraints on these models imposed by the longevity of the proton, the cold dark matter density and the measured value of the Higgs boson. We find that SU(5) with a CMSSM-like pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking has difficulty in accommodating all the constraints, whereas SU(5) with pure gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking can accommodate them easily. We also consider two SO(10) symmetry-breaking patterns that can accommodate the ACT and SPT data. In both the SU(5) and SO(10) models, the deformations avoid issues associated with large initial field values in the Starobinsky model: in particular, the total number of e-folds is largely independent of the initial conditions.",

Even though we recover a common-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz gravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves. Therefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in the most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\% credibility upper limit of $\approx 7 \times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive to supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\geq 10^9M_{\odot}$ up to a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and 200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times better sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based on the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a key role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy.",
