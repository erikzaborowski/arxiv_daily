New submissions,Velocity Reconstruction from KSZ: Measuring $f_{NL}$ with ACT and DESILS,"Selim C. Hotinli,Kendrick M. Smith,Simone Ferraro",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect offers an indirect way to reconstruct large-scale cosmic velocities, by correlating high-resolution CMB temperature maps with galaxy surveys. In this work, we present the first three-dimensional reconstruction of the large-scale velocity field using a photometric galaxy survey, using data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESILS) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR5. We detect an $11.7\sigma$ correlation between our velocity reconstruction and the galaxy field, using only DESILS LRGs in the northern Galactic hemisphere. We find that the overall amplitude of the kSZ-induced correlation is low relative to a halo model prediction ($b_v = 0.45^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$), in agreement with previous results which find high feedback and smoothed gas profiles near massive galaxies. We use this measurement to place new constraints on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), obtaining $f_{\rm NL}\!=\!-39^{+40}_{-33}$. This represents the most stringent $f_{\rm NL}$ constraint from kSZ velocity-based analyses to date. We validate our findings through extensive null tests, including tests for CMB foregrounds based on comparing 90 and 150 GHz CMB data.",
New submissions,TDCOSMO XXIII. First spatially resolved kinematics of the lens galaxy obtained using JWST-NIRSpec to improve time-delay cosmography,"Anowar J. Shajib,Tommaso Treu,Sherry H.

Frieman,Alejandra Melo,Takahiro Morishita,Pritom Mozumdar,Dominique Sluse,Massimo Stiavelli",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Spatially resolved stellar kinematics has become a key ingredient in time-delay cosmography to break the mass-sheet degeneracy in the mass profile and, in turn, provide a precise constraint on the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters. In this paper, we present the first measurements of 2D resolved stellar kinematics for the lens galaxy in the quadruply lensed quasar system \lensname, using integral field spectroscopy from the JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), marking the first such measurement conducted with the JWST. In extracting robust kinematic measurements from this first-of-its-kind dataset, we made methodological improvements both in the data reduction and kinematic extraction. In our kinematic extraction procedure, we performed joint modeling of the lens galaxy, the quasar, and its host galaxy's contributions in the spectra to deblend the lens galaxy component and robustly constrain its stellar kinematics. Our improved methodological frameworks are released as software pipelines for future use: \textsc{squirrel} for extracting stellar kinematics, and \textsc{RegalJumper} for JWST-NIRSpec data reduction, incorporating additional artifact cleaning beyond the standard JWST pipeline. We compared our measured stellar kinematics from the JWST NIRSpec with previously obtained ground-based measurements from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field unit and find that the two datasets are statistically consistent at a $\sim$1.1$\sigma$ confidence level. Our measured kinematics will be used in a future study to improve the precision of the Hubble constant measurement.",

Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing measurements obtained by cross-correlating spectroscopically observed galaxies from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) with source galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey, the Kilo-Degree Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the Dark Energy Survey. Specifically, we measure the excess surface mass density $\Delta\Sigma$ and tangential shear $\gamma_\mathrm{t}$ for the Bright Galaxy Sample and Luminous Red Galaxies measured within the first year of observations with DESI. To ensure robustness, we test the measurements for systematic biases, finding no significant trends related to the properties of the \acrshort{desi} lens galaxies. We identify a significant trend with the average redshift of source galaxies, however, this trend vanishes once we apply shifts to the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey redshift distributions that are also favored by their fiducial cosmology analysis. Additionally, we compare the observed scatter in the measurements with the theoretical covariance and find excess scatter, driven primarily by small-scale measurements of $r\leq 1 \, \mathrm{Mpc}/h$; measurements on larger scales are consistent at the $2\,\sigma$ level. We further present the projected clustering measurements $w_p$ of the galaxy samples in the the first data release of DESI. These measurements, which will be made publicly available, serve as a foundation for forthcoming cosmological analyses.",
New submissions,KSZ Velocity Reconstruction with ACT and DESI-LS using a Tomographic QML Power Spectrum Estimator,"Anderson C. M. Lai,Yurii Kvasiuk,Moritz Münchmeyer",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We perform kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) velocity reconstruction on data from ACT DR6 and DESI-LS DR9. To estimate the cross-power between kSZ velocity reconstruction and galaxy density, we make use of a novel quadratic maximum likelihood QML power spectrum estimator implementation in red-shift binned spherical coordinates. We find a detection of the kSZ signal from the cross-correlation between the estimated velocity field and the large-scale galaxy field of $11.7 \sigma$. We estimate an amplitude $A=0.39 \pm 0.04$ of the kSZ signal with respect to a halo model prediction, possibly indicating a high feedback in massive halos, in agreement with previous studies. Our result demonstrates the feasibility of an optimal QML pipeline at the resolution required for this analysis, and will be a powerful tool for kSZ cosmology with upcoming high-resolution surveys.",
New submissions,Kinematic misalignment as a driver of black hole activity in galaxies with external interactions,"Sandra I. Raimundo,Rogerio Riffel,Song-lin Li,Cristina Ramos Almeida,Sandro Rembold,Rogemar A. Riffel,Thaisa Storchi-Bergmann,Marianne Vestergaard,José L. Tous",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The process of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) fuelling relies on the transport of gas across several orders of magnitude in physical scale until the gas reaches the supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy. This work explores the role of kinematically misaligned gas in the fuelling of AGN in a sample of 4769 local galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We investigate for the first time the relative role of external interactions and the presence of kinematic misalignment as mechanisms to explain the observed increase in AGN fraction in galaxies with large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment ($>$45 degrees). Using a sample of galaxies with evidence of recent external interactions we find that there is a significantly higher fraction of AGN in those where a large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment is observed (20$^{+6}_{-4}\%$) compared with 6.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\%$ in galaxies where no kinematic misalignment is observed. We determine that gas to stellar misalignment has an important role in the fraction of AGN observed, increasing the AGN fraction beyond the potential effect of external interactions. This result demonstrates the importance of misaligned structures to the fuelling of supermassive black holes.",
New submissions,Towards an Observational Detection of Halo Spin Bias using Spin-Orbit Coherence,"Yigon Kim,Antonio D. Montero-Dorta,Rory Smith,Jong-Ho Shinn",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Context. The clustering of dark-matter halos depends primarily on halo mass. However, at fixed halo mass, numerical simulations have revealed multiple secondary dependencies. This so-called secondary halo bias has important implications for our understanding of structure formation and observational cosmology. Despite its significance, the effect has not yet been measured observationally with statistical confidence. Aims. We aim to develop the first observational method to probe halo spin bias: the secondary dependence of halo clustering on halo spin at fixed halo mass. Methods. We use a proxy for halo spin based on the coherent motion of galaxies within and around a halo. This technique is tested using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation and subsequently applied to a group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By splitting the SDSS groups according to this spin proxy and measuring the two-point correlation function of the resulting samples, the existence of halo spin bias is investigated. Results. We find consistent indications that, at fixed mass, groups with higher values of the spin proxy exhibit higher bias than those with lower spin proxy values, on scales of 5-15 ${h}^{-1}$$\mathrm{Mpc}$. The highest significance is seen for groups with halo masses ${M}_{\rm h} \gtrsim {10}^{13.2}$ ${h}^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$, for which 85$\%$ of the sampled measurements display the expected trend. As we continue to improve the method, our results could open new avenues for studying the connection between halo spin and the large-scale structure with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.",
New submissions,Decoding AGN Feedback with X-arithmetic: From Morphology to Physical Mechanisms,"Hannah McCall,Irina Zhuravleva,Eugene Churazov,Congyao Zhang,William Forman,Christine Jones,Yuan Li",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a key process in the evolution of massive halos in the Universe. New observational information on feedback is crucial for improving the implementation of the physics in numerical models. In this work, we apply a novel image-manipulation technique, termed 'X-arithmetic', to a sample of 15 galaxy clusters and groups deeply observed with Chandra. This technique decomposes perturbations in feedback-dominated regions into images excluding either (1) weak shocks and sound waves, (2) bubbles inflated by jets, or (3) cooling and slow gas motions (isobaric perturbations), enabling efficient spatial identification of these features without involving spectroscopic analysis. We confirm the nature of previously (spectroscopically-)identified features and newly establish the origin of other structures. We find that feedback produces multiple shocks in groups and massive galaxies, but only one to two shocks in clusters. Prominent isobaric structures are abundant around inner cavities in clusters, compared to almost no such structures in groups. These differences suggest that feedback effects are stronger in smaller-mass systems, possibly due to the shallower gravitational potential of groups or more violent feedback. Follow-up spectroscopy, guided by the X-arithmetic results, suggests that earlier-identified ""isothermal shocks"" could be a mix of isobaric and adiabatic structures. We applied X-arithmetic to galaxy cluster simulations, demonstrating its straightforward application and future potential for testing the feedback physics details in simulations. Our feasibility study shows that imaging data from future X-ray observatories like AXIS will be ideal for expanding X-arithmetic application to a larger sample of objects.",
New submissions,Updated constraints on Regge-Teitelboim gravity,"S. R. Pinto,C. J. A. P. Martins",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In the Regge-Teitelboim model, gravity is described by embedding the space-time manifold in a (usually flat) fixed higher-dimensional background, where the embedding coordinates, rather than the metric tensor, are the dynamical degrees of freedom. Stern \& Xu extended the Regge-Teitelboim framework to encompass scenarios where the background embedding space is not flat, noting that when the background is a five-dimensional de Sitter space, the Robertson-Walker manifold undergoes a transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating one. Previously, we constrained this model using only low-redshift observations. Here we further explore the observational constraints on this scenario, and report significantly more stringent constraints by including high-redshift data, specifically from the cosmic microwave background. Our results are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, with the putative model-specific energy component responsible for the recent acceleration being constrained to $\Omega_{RT}<0.006$ and the de Sitter curvature radius in units of the Hubble constant being constrained to $LH_0>1.45$, both at the 95 percent confidence level.",
New submissions,Disentangling the growth rate of perturbations from the HI bias using only clustering data from galaxy surveys,"Pankaj Chavan,Tapomoy Guha Sarkar,Anjan A Sen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This work serves two-fold purpose. Firstly, we provide an alternative to the traditional method of determining the growth rate of density perturbations $f(z)$. In usual practice, $f(z)$ can not be directly measured from tracer clustering at some redshift without knowledge of the bias. While the bayron acoustic oscillation (BAO) imprint allows the determination of $(D_A(z), H(z))$, redshift space anisotropy (RSD) allows the measurement of a quantity $f_8(z) = f(z) \sigma_{8,0} D_{+}(z)$. To extract $f(z)$ from $f_8(z)$, one usually requires some other data set. We show that precise BAO and RSD measurements in and around some key redshifts themselves can solely reconstruct $f(z)$ without requiring any other data sets. Secondly, we extend this approach to another tracer, namely the post-reionization 21-cm brightness temperature intensity maps. We demonstrate that the measured $f(z)$ from purely redshift space clustering allows us to measure the 21-cm bias, which is a largely unknown quantity. This may help interpret the observed intensity mapping signal in the future.",
New submissions,"Stretch to stretch, dust to dust: low-value local $H_{0}$ measurement from two-population modelling of type Ia supernovae","Radosław Wojtak,Jens Hjorth",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We revisit the local Hubble constant measurement from type Ia supernovae calibrated with Cepheids (SH0ES) by remodelling the supernova data using two supernova populations emerging from the observed bimodal distribution of the SALT2 stretch parameter. Our analysis accounts for population differences in both intrinsic properties (related to possible initial conditions, including supernova progenitor channels) and host-galaxy extinction (expected from well-known environmental differences associated observationally with the two populations). Based on a two-population Bayesian hierarchical modelling of the SALT2 light-curve parameters from the Pantheon+ compilation, we simultaneously constrain intrinsic and extrinsic properties of both supernova populations, match probabilistically the calibration supernovae with the corresponding population in the Hubble flow, and derive the Hubble constant. The difference between the two supernova populations is primarily driven by their mean absolute magnitudes and total-to-selective extinction coefficients. This is related but not equivalent to the traditional mass-step correction (including its broadening for reddened supernovae). The mean extinction coefficient of the supernova population used to propagate distances from the calibration galaxies to the Hubble flow is found to be consistent with the Milky Way-like interstellar dust model with R_B~4 and substantially higher than the extinction model assumed in the SH0ES measurement. Allowing for possible differences between reddening in the calibration galaxies and the corresponding population in the Hubble flow, we obtain H_0=70.59+/-1.15 km/s/Mpc. For the most conservative choice assuming equal prior distributions, we find H_0=71.45+/-1.03 km/s/Mpc. Our reanalysis of type Ia supernovae results in a reduction of the discrepancy with the Planck H_0 by at least 30 and up to 50 per cent (3.5-2.2sigma).",

Zhou(for the LiteBIRD Collaboration)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"In this work, we study the impact of an imperfect knowledge of the instrument bandpasses on the estimate of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in the context of the next-generation LiteBIRD satellite. We develop a pipeline to include bandpass integration in both the time-ordered data (TOD) and the map-making processing steps. We introduce the systematic effect by having a mismatch between the ``real'', high resolution bandpass $\tau$, entering the TOD, and the estimated one $\tau_s$, used in the map-making. We focus on two aspects: the effect of degrading the $\tau_s$ resolution, and the addition of a Gaussian error $\sigma$ to $\tau_s$. To reduce the computational load of the analysis, the two effects are explored separately, for three representative LiteBIRD channels (40 GHz, 140 GHz and 402 GHz) and for three bandpass shapes. Computing the amount of bias on $r$, $\Delta r$, caused by these effects on a single channel, we find that a resolution $\lesssim 1.5$ GHz and $\sigma \lesssim 0.0089$ do not exceed the LiteBIRD budget allocation per systematic effect, $\Delta r < 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. We then check that propagating separately the uncertainties due to a resolution of 1 GHz and a measurement error with $\sigma = 0.0089$ in all LiteBIRD frequency channels, for the most pessimistic bandpass shape of the three considered, still produces a $\Delta r < 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. This is done both with the simple deprojection approach and with a blind component separation technique, the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC). Due to the effectiveness of NILC in cleaning the systematic residuals, we have tested that the requirement on $\sigma$ can be relaxed to $\sigma \lesssim 0.05$. (Abridged)",
New submissions,Euclid preparation. Full-shape modelling of 2-point and 3-point correlation functions in real space,Euclid Collaboration,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the accuracy and range of validity of the perturbative model for the 2-point (2PCF) and 3-point (3PCF) correlation functions in real space in view of the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid mission spectroscopic sample. We take advantage of clustering measurements from four snapshots of the Flagship I N-body simulations at z = {0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8}, which mimic the expected galaxy population in the ideal case of absence of observational effects such as purity and completeness. For the 3PCF we consider all available triangle configurations given a minimal separation. First, we assess the model performance by fixing the cosmological parameters and evaluating the goodness-of-fit provided by the perturbative bias expansion in the joint analysis of the two statistics, finding overall agreement with the data down to separations of 20 Mpc/h. Subsequently, we build on the state-of-the-art and extend the analysis to include the dependence on three cosmological parameters: the amplitude of scalar perturbations As, the matter density {\omega}cdm and the Hubble parameter h. To achieve this goal, we develop an emulator capable of generating fast and robust modelling predictions for the two summary statistics, allowing efficient sampling of the joint likelihood function. We therefore present the first joint full-shape analysis of the real-space 2PCF and 3PCF, testing the consistency and constraining power of the perturbative model across both probes, and assessing its performance in a combined likelihood framework. We explore possible systematic uncertainties induced by the perturbative model at small scales finding an optimal scale cut of rmin = 30 Mpc/h for the 3PCF, when imposing an additional limitation on nearly isosceles triangular configurations included in the data vector. This work is part of a Euclid Preparation series validating theoretical models for galaxy clustering.",

Zuntz",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We develop a framework to study the relation between the stellar mass of a galaxy and the total mass of its host dark matter halo using galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We model a wide range of scales, roughly from $\sim 100 \; {\rm kpc}$ to $\sim 100 \; {\rm Mpc}$, using a theoretical framework based on the Halo Occupation Distribution and data from Year 3 of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset. The new advances of this work include: 1) the generation and validation of a new stellar mass-selected galaxy sample in the range of $\log M_\star/M_\odot \sim 9.6$ to $\sim 11.5$; 2) the joint-modeling framework of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing that is able to describe our stellar mass-selected sample deep into the 1-halo regime; and 3) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) constraints from this dataset. In general, our SHMR constraints agree well with existing literature with various weak lensing measurements. We constrain the free parameters in the SHMR functional form $\log M_\star (M_h) = \log(\epsilon M_1) + f\left[ \log\left( M_h / M_1 \right) \right] - f(0)$, with $f(x) \equiv -\log(10^{\alpha x}+1) + \delta [\log(1+\exp(x))]^\gamma / [1+\exp(10^{-x})]$, to be $\log M_1 = 11.559^{+0.334}_{-0.415}$, $\log \epsilon = -1.689^{+0.333}_{-0.220}$, $\alpha = -1.637^{+0.107}_{-0.096}$, $\gamma = 0.588^{+0.265}_{-0.220}$ and $\delta = 4.227^{+2.223}_{-1.776}$. The inferred average satellite fraction is within $\sim 5-35\%$ for our fiducial results and we do not see any clear trends with redshift or stellar mass. Furthermore, we find that the inferred average galaxy bias values follow the generally expected trends with stellar mass and redshift. Our study is the first SHMR in DES in this mass range, and we expect the stellar mass sample to be of general interest for other science cases.",
New submissions,Cosmography with DESI DR2 and SN data,"Gabriel Rodrigues,Rayff de Souza,Jailson Alcaniz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this paper, we present a kinematic analysis of the Universe's expansion history using cosmography, with a particular emphasis on the jerk parameter $j_0$, which is equal to one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario. We use distance measurements from DESI DR2, both independently and in combination with current Type Ia supernova (SN) samples, to constrain the cosmographic parameters up to the fourth order without relying on a specific cosmological model. Our results show that for the DESI DR2 data alone, the $\Lambda$CDM prediction ($j_0 = 1$) falls within the 2$\sigma$ confidence region. However, when DESI DR2 is combined with the Union3, Pantheon+, and DESY5 SN datasets, the result obtained is discrepant with the $\Lambda$CDM model at about 3.4$\sigma$, 4.1$\sigma$, and 5.4$\sigma$, respectively. These results are consistent with the conclusions based on dark energy parameterizations reported by the DESI Collaboration, which suggest the presence of a dynamic dark energy component in the universe.",

New submissions,Cost Effective Designs For Next-Generation Radio Telescopes,"G B Raghavkrishna,Deeptangshu Banik,B Ravi Kumar,D Veeraswamy",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Radio astronomy has entered its golden era, with many revolutionary facilities such as SKA, ngVLA, and LOFAR2.0 coming online in the next decade. These facilities are certain to redefine radio astronomy. However, on smaller scales-such as at institutional or amateur levels-radio astronomy is still mostly practiced for educational or personal interest. The primary reason small-scale radio astronomical experiments rarely produce cutting-edge scientific results is the limitation of funding available for procuring or developing components similar to those used in professional-grade facilities. A second major reason is the lack of tools and skills required for simulating components for a complete telescope. In this work, we address the first of these challenges and suggest novel ideas and designs for cost-effective, next-generation radio telescopes that can be built at small scales. We also describe the observational strategies required to produce cutting-edge scientific results with these telescopes-results comparable to those from professional facilities.",

We perform a tomographic measurement in three bins centered at effective redshifts z=1.44, 2.27 and 2.75, which have ample overlap with the CMB lensing kernel. From a joint fit using the angular clustering of all three redshift bins (auto and cross-spectra), and including an $\Omega_m$ prior from DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillations to break the $\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ degeneracy, we constrain the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the matter-dominated regime to be $\sigma_8=0.929^{+0.059}_{-0.074}$ and $S_8\equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.922^{+0.059}_{-0.073}$. We provide a growth of structure measurement with the largest spectroscopic quasar sample to date at high redshift, which is 1.5$\sigma$ higher than predictions from $\Lambda$CDM fits to measurements of the primary CMB from Planck PR4. The cross-correlation between PR4 lensing maps and DESI DR1 quasars is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 21.7 and the quasar auto-correlation at 27.2 for the joint analysis of all redshift bins. We combine our measurement with the CMB lensing auto-spectrum from the ground-based Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and Planck PR4 to perform a sound-horizon-free measurement of the Hubble constant, yielding $H_0=69.1^{+2.2}_{-2.6}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ through its sensitivity to the matter-radiation equality scale.",
New submissions,"Gravitational redshift from large-scale structure: nonlinearities, anti-symmetries, and the dipole","Lawrence Dam,Camille Bonvin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational redshift imprints a slight asymmetry in the observed clustering of galaxies, producing odd multipoles (e.g.\ the dipole) in the cross-correlation function. But there are other sources of asymmetry which must also be considered in any model which aims to measure gravitational redshift from large-scale structure. In this work we develop a nonlinear model of the redshift-space correlation function complete down to these subleading, asymmetric effects. In addition to gravitational redshift and the well-known redshift-space distortions, our model, given by a compact nonperturbative formula, also accounts for wide-angle effects (to all orders), lightcone effects, and other kinematic contributions. We compare our model with $N$-body simulations and find good agreement; in particular we find that the observed turnover in the dipole moment around a separation of $20\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ (a feature absent in the linear predictions) is well accounted for. By examining the exchange properties of distinct tracers, we identify the pairwise potential difference as the key physical ingredient of the dipole. Several new insights related to the theory of redshift-space distortions are also given.",
Cross submissions,A Common Origin of Asymmetric Self-interacting Dark Matter and Dirac Leptogenesis,"Manoranjan Dutta,Nimmala Narendra",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Assuming dark matter to be asymmetric as well as self-interacting and neutrinos to be Dirac fermions, we propose a framework to address the observed baryon imbalance of the universe. We add three right-handed neutrinos $\nu_{R_i},\,{i=1,2,3}$, one singlet fermion $\chi$, a doublet fermion $\psi$, and heavy scalar doublets $\eta_i,\,{i=1,2}$ to the Standard Model. Both $\chi$ and $\psi$ are fermions with non-zero charge under an extended $U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_D$ symmetry. Additionally, a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed, where the singlets $\chi$, $\nu_R$, and $\eta$ are negative and the doublet $\psi$ is positive. Given the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles, $B-L$ turns into an exact symmetry of the universe. The CP-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy scalar $\eta$ generates an equal and opposite $B-L$ asymmetry among the left-handed ($\nu_L$) and right-handed ($\nu_R$) neutrinos. The $\nu_L-\nu_R$ equilibration process does not take place until below the Electroweak phase transition scale because of tiny Yukawa couplings. During this time, Sphaleron processes, which are active at temperatures higher than 100 GeV, transform a portion of the $B-L$ asymmetry stored in left-handed neutrinos into baryon asymmetry. MeV scale gauge boson $Z'$ of $U(1)_D$ sector mediates both annihilation of symmetric dark matter component and self-interaction among dark matter particles. Moreover, $Z'$ mixes with the Standard Model Z-boson and provides a portal for dark matter direct detection.",
