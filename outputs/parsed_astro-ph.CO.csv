Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The standard cosmological analysis with the Ly$\alpha$ forest relies on a continuum fitting procedure that suppresses information on large scales and distorts the three-dimensional correlation function on all scales. In this work, we present the first cosmological forecasts without continuum fitting distortion in the Ly$\alpha$ forest, focusing on the recovery of large-scale information. Using idealized synthetic data, we compare the constraining power of the full shape of the Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasars using the baseline continuum fitting analysis versus the true continuum. We find that knowledge of the true continuum enables a $\sim10\%$ reduction in uncertainties on the Alcock-Paczyński (AP) parameter and the matter density, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. We also explore the impact of large-scale information by extending the analysis up to separations of $240\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ along and across the line of sight. The combination of these analysis choices can recover significant large-scale information, yielding up to a $\sim15\%$ improvement in AP constraints. This improvement is analogous to extending the Ly$\alpha$ forest survey area by $\sim40\%$.",
New submissions,pbhstat: A Python package for calculating the primordial black hole abundance,"Philippa S. Cole,Jacopo Fumagalli",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present pbhstat, a publicly available Python package designed to compute the mass function and total abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) from a given primordial power spectrum. The package offers a modular framework using multiple statistical approaches, including Press-Schechter theory, peaks theory, and formalisms based on the non-linear compaction function. Currently, the implementation is limited to scenarios with nearly Gaussian initial conditions.",
New submissions,Enhanced Radio Emission Between a Galaxy Cluster Pair,"Andrea Botteon,Turgay Caglar,Sibel Döner,Reinout J. van Weeren,Krista Lynne Smith",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Interacting galaxy cluster pairs offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of the gas in the intracluster bridge connecting them. As a consequence of the encounter, both the X-ray and radio emission from the gas are expected to be enhanced by shocks and turbulence, facilitating their detection. PSZ2 G279.79+39.09 is likely an off-axis merging system at $z = 0.29$, with its two main components observed shortly after pericenter passage. In this paper, we investigate the presence of diffuse radio emission in this system. We observed the cluster pair with the MeerKAT UHF band (544-1088 MHz) for 7.5 h and uGMRT band 3 (300-500 MHz) for 8 h. These are the first targeted radio observations of this system. We discover diffuse synchrotron emission in the system, with indication of enhanced emission in the region bridging the cluster pair. The detection is based on MeerKAT UHF data, while uGMRT band 3 observations do not allow us to derive a stringent limit on the spectral index of the source. This emission is likely generated by the turbulence injected in the early stage after the cluster-cluster encounter. However, the study of its physical properties is limited by the current data. As other systems with multiple cluster components studied in recent years, this cluster pair represents an appealing target to probe nonthermal phenomena beyond the well-studied denser regions of the intracluster medium. While we report a new detection, our analysis highlights the need for multi-band observations to fully understand these sources.",
New submissions,Probing initial isocurvature perturbation with 21cm one-point statistics,"Zhenfei Qin,Hayato Shimabukuro",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Isocurvature perturbations expected from multi-field inflation models can leave unique signatures in the early Universe, but remain weakly constrained, especially on small scales. In this work, we investigate the constraining power of one-point statistics (variance and skewness) of the 21cm brightness temperature during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, using semi-numerical simulations from 21cmFAST. We model both adiabatic and cold dark matter isocurvature modes, exploring their impact on the matter power spectrum, the timing of structure formation, and the evolution of neutral hydrogen. By varying astrophysical parameters as well as isocurvature fraction and spectral index, we quantify their respective effects on the 21cm power spectrum and on one-point statistics. Our results show that while variance is highly sensitive to the timing of cosmic events and provides tight constraints on isocurvature parameters, skewness is more strongly affected by astrophysical uncertainties and observational noise. Incorporating realistic instrumental noise based on SKA configurations, we perform a Fisher analysis and demonstrate that 21cm variance measurements can constrain the isocurvature fraction down to the sub-percent level, though a strong degeneracy with the spectral index remains. We discuss the importance of complementary probes, such as the 21cm forest and galaxy surveys, to break these parameter degeneracies. Our findings highlight the power of 21cm one-point statistics as robust and independent tools for probing early-Universe physics beyond what is accessible with traditional power spectrum analyses.",
New submissions,The Altered Chaplygin Model as a Model for Dark Energy,"Yi-Syuan, Wu,Chuan-Jui Li,W. F. Kao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a scalar-field formulation of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) and modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) models, in which the cosmic fluid dynamics are reproduced by canonical Lagrangians with analytically derived energy density $\rho(\phi)$, pressure $p(\phi)$, and scalar potential $V(\phi)$. This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances. We examine four models, $\Lambda$CDM, GCG, MCG, and ACG, obtaining posterior constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$, the present-day effective equation of state $\omega_0$, the transition redshift $z^\star$, and the cosmic age $t_0$. With the Cepheid calibration fixing the absolute distance scale, the inferred $H_{0}$ remains nearly model-independent. The Chaplygin-type models predict an earlier onset of cosmic acceleration than $\Lambda$CDM and give a broader range for the inferred age of the Universe, reflecting their greater flexibility in late-time expansion histories. Among them, the ACG model provides tighter parameter constraints, while the GCG and MCG models produce broader posteriors due to parameter degeneracies.",
New submissions,No evidence for $H_0$ anisotropy from Tully-Fisher or supernova distances,"Richard Stiskalek,Harry Desmond,Guilhem Lavaux",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Claims of anisotropy in the Hubble constant have been made based on direct distance tracers such as Tully-Fisher galaxies and Type Ia supernovae. We revisit these using the CosmicFlows-4 Tully-Fisher W1 subsample, 2MTF and SFI++ Tully-Fisher catalogues, and the Pantheon+ supernova compilation (restricted to $z < 0.05$), including a dipole in either the Tully-Fisher zero-point or the standardised supernova absolute magnitude. Our forward-modelling framework jointly calibrates the distance relation, marginalises over distances, and accounts for peculiar velocities using a linear-theory reconstruction. We compare the anisotropic and isotropic model using the Bayesian evidence. In the CosmicFlows-4 sample, we infer a zero-point dipole of amplitude $0.087 \pm 0.019$ mag, or $4.1\pm0.9$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. This is consistent with previous estimates but at higher significance: model comparison yields odds of $877\!:\!1$ in favour of including the zero-point dipole. In Pantheon+ we infer zero-point dipole amplitude of $0.049 \pm 0.013$ mag, or $2.3\pm 0.6$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. However, by allowing for a radially varying velocity dipole, we show that the anisotropic model captures local flow features (or possibly systematics) in the data rather than an actual linearly growing effective bulk flow caused by anisotropy in the zero-point or expansion rate. Inferring a more general bulk flow curve we find results fully consistent with expectations from the standard cosmological model.",
New submissions,Constraining Cosmology with Double-Source-Plane Strong Gravitational Lenses From the AGEL Survey,"Duncan J. Bowden,Nandini Sahu,Anowar J. Shajib,Kim-Vy Tran,Tania M. Barone,Keerthi Vasan G.C.,Daniel J. Ballard,Thomas E. Collett,Faith Dalessandro,Giovanni Ferrami,Karl Glazebrook,William J. Gottemoller,Leena Iwamoto,Tucker Jones,Glenn G. Kacprzak,Geraint F. Lewis,Haven McIntosh-Lombardo,Hannah Skobe,Sherry H. Suyu,Sarah M. Sweet",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Double-source-plane strong gravitational lenses (DSPLs), with two sources at different redshifts, are independent cosmological probes of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We present the lens model for the DSPL AGEL035346$-$170639 and infer cosmological constraints from this system for flat $\Lambda$CDM and flat $w$CDM cosmologies. From the joint posterior of $w$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ in the flat $w$CDM cosmology, we extract the following median values and 1$\sigma$ uncertainties: $w = -1.52^{+0.49}_{-0.33}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.192^{+0.305}_{-0.131}$ from AGEL0353 alone. Combining our measurements with two previously analyzed DSPLs, we present the joint constraint on these parameters from a sample of three, the largest galaxy-scale DSPL sample used for cosmological measurement to date. The combined precision of $w$ from three DSPLs is higher by 15% over AGEL0353 alone. Combining DSPL and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements improves the precision of $w$ from CMB-only constraints by 39%, demonstrating the complementarity of DSPLs with the CMB. Despite their promising constraining power, DSPLs are limited by sample size, with only a handful discovered so far. Although ongoing and near-future wide-area sky surveys will increase the number of known DSPLs by up to two orders of magnitude, these systems will still require dedicated high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic follow-ups like those presented in this paper. Our ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) collaboration is undertaking such follow-up campaigns for several newly discovered DSPLs and will provide cosmological measurements from larger samples of DSPLs in the future.",
New submissions,A dark energy model for coasting cosmology,"Yunliang Ren,Xiaofeng Yang,Xuwei Zhang,Shuangnan Chen,Yangjun Shi,Cheng Cheng,Xiaolong He,Hoernisa Iminniyaz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Coasting cosmology offers an intriguing and straightforward framework for understanding the universe. In this work, we employ the Trans-Planckian Censorship Criterion (TCC) conjecture to test the viability of the coasting cosmology and propose an entropic dark energy (EDE) model within this framework. By applying the holographic principle to constrain the dark energy density and adopting the Bekenstein entropy and Tsallis entropy as the constraining entropies of the system, we find that, in a holographic coasting cosmological framework where dark energy and dark matter evolve independently, the Tsallis entropy satisfies certain general assumptions better than the Bekenstein entropy. Thus, there may be a fundamental relationship between Tsallis entropy and dark energy. We utilize observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) to constrain EDE model. The optimal Tsallis parameter obtained aligns well with theoretical expectations. To evaluate the model's fit to the observed data, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kullback Information Criterion (KIC), and compare these metrics with those derived from $\Lambda$CDM, under which the model shows some improvement. Overall, this model provides a novel and simple on the evolution of the universe.",
New submissions,Exponential quintessence with momentum coupling to dark matter,Alkistis Pourtsidou,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present updated constraints on an interacting dark energy - dark matter model with pure momentum transfer, where dark energy is in the form of a quintessence scalar field with an exponential potential. We run a suite of MCMC analyses using the DESI DR2 BAO measurements, in combination with CMB data from Planck and supernovae data from DESY5. In contrast to the standard case of uncoupled quintessence, we find that values for the potential's slope parameter $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$, which are conjectured by string theory scenarios, are not excluded. If $\lambda$ is fixed to such a value, we find that the data favour the negative coupling branch of the model, which is the branch exhibiting late-time growth suppression. We also derive 95% upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses, finding $\sum m_\nu < 0.06$ eV ($\sum m_\nu < 0.16$ eV) when $\lambda$ is fixed (varied). Our results motivate further studies on dynamical dark energy models that obey string theory bounds and can be constrained with cosmological observations.",
New submissions,Parameterizing quasi-quintessence and quasi-phantom fields without the nearly flat potential approximation,"Anna Chiara Alfano,Youri Carloni",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"An alternative dark energy description based on a generalized K-essence scenario is here explored. In particular, we consider a \emph{quasi-quintessence} and/or \emph{quasi-phantom} field, whose pressure does not depend on the kinetic energy, firstly discussed in the context of the cosmological constant problem. In so doing, we fix the background evolution and investigate the main observational signatures of its corresponding fluid-like representation. The corresponding scalar field can be parameterized independently from the potential form and without imposing the condition $\omega \sim -1$ used for quintessence and phantom fields. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters by performing Monte-Carlo Markov chain simulations through the adoption of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and perform separated analyses, employing different data catalogs. More precisely, as data sets we employ observational Hubble data, type Ia supernovae and the second data release from the DESI Collaboration, namely DESI DR2. We define a hierarchy among analyses and, precisely, in the first we adopt all three samples, while the second excludes the DESI data points, with the aim of facing its effect on corresponding bounds. Our findings suggest that the \emph{quasi-quintessence} scenario prefers Planck's value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, but suggesting that, when the DESI sample is excluded from our computations, $\omega_0$ enters the phantom regime, although still compatible at $1$-$\sigma$ confidence level with a cosmological constant. Remarkably, these results appear in tension than those found for a standard quintessence, explored within the context of the recent DESI release, likely indicating that the DESI data may furnish inconclusive results depending on the kind of scalar field involved into the computation.",
New submissions,Parameter sensitivity of cosmic pairwise velocities in the non-linear regime of structure formation,"Jorge Enrique García-Farieta,Héctor J. Hortúa",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The peculiar velocities of dark matter tracers drive the growth of cosmic structures, providing a sensitive test of cosmological models and strengthening constraints on the nature of dark energy. In this work, we investigate the mean pairwise velocities, $v_{12}$, of dark matter tracers as a cosmological probe in the non-linear regime of cosmic structure formation. Using N-body dark matter-only simulations, we measure $v_{12}$ for pair separations up to 50 $h^{-1}$Mpc and model it by solving the pair conservation equation for a self-gravitating particle system, along with various prescriptions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. We quantified the sensitivity of $v_{12}$ to variations in key cosmological parameters such as $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, $\sigma_8$, $h$, $M_\nu$, and $w$. Our parameter inference analysis using MCMC shows sub-11% agreement with simulation data, with notable degeneracies, particularly between $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma_8$. We further compute the stable clustering crossing scale across redshifts $z=0$, $0.5$, and $1$, assessing its dependence on cosmology. Among the tested power spectrum modeling approaches, we find that the CSSTEmu emulator provides the most accurate predictions, with deviations below 5% for $r > 10$ $h^{-1}$Mpc at $z=0.5$. Our results are validated using independent simulation suites, demonstrating that our framework offers a robust method for extracting cosmological constraints from upcoming peculiar velocity data.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational collapse with torsion and universe in a black hole,Nikodem Popławski,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We consider gravitational collapse of a fluid sphere with torsion generated by spin, which forms a black hole. We use the Tolman metric and the Einstein$-$Cartan field equations with a relativistic spin fluid as a source. We show that gravitational repulsion of torsion prevents a singularity, replacing it with a nonsingular bounce. Quantum particle creation during contraction prevents shear from overcoming torsion. Particle creation during expansion can generate a finite period of inflation and produce large amounts of matter. The resulting closed universe on the other side of the event horizon may have several bounces. Such a universe is oscillatory, with each cycle larger than the preceding cycle, until it reaches a size at which dark energy dominates and expands indefinitely. Our Universe might have therefore originated from a black hole existing in another universe.",
Cross submissions,"From geometry to cosmology: a pedagogical review of inflation in curvature, torsion, and extended gravity theories",Davood Momeni,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories. These include models based on curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. We explore how scalar fields interact with different geometric quantities and how these interactions affect inflationary dynamics. Key cosmological features such as background evolution, reheating, and observable parameters are discussed. We also examine exotic scenarios inspired by string theory, extra dimensions, and non-local models. This work aims to connect theoretical models with observational data and future missions, offering guidance for exploring inflation beyond general relativity.",
Cross submissions,Probing the meV QCD Axion with the $\texttt{SQWARE}$ Quantum Semiconductor Haloscope,"Jaanita Mehrani,Tao Xu,Andrey Baydin,Michael J. Manfra,Henry O. Everitt,Andrew J. Long,Kuver Sinha,Junichiro Kono,Shengxi Huang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We propose the Semiconductor-Quantum-Well Axion Radiometer Experiment ($\texttt{SQWARE}$) -- a new experimental platform for direct detection of axion dark matter in the meV mass range -- based on resonantly enhanced axion-photon conversion through the inverse Primakoff effect in engineered quantum semiconductor heterostructures. The core of the radiometer is a GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well structure forming a magnetoplasmonic cavity, containing an ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, which realizes a tunable epsilon-near-zero resonance in the terahertz frequency range. By controlling the orientation of the cavity within a strong external magnetic field, both the resonance frequency and the axion-induced current are optimized $\textit{in situ}$, enabling efficient scanning across a broad mass range without complex mechanical adjustment. The axion-induced electromagnetic signal radiatively emitted from the magnetoplasmonic cavity is detected by a state-of-the-art photodetector. We present the theoretical basis for resonant enhancement, detail the experimental design and benchmarks through extensive simulations, and project the sensitivity of $\texttt{SQWARE}$ for several realistic configurations. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SQWARE}$ can probe the well-motivated quantum chromodynamics axion parameter space and close a critical gap in direct searches at meV masses.",
Cross submissions,High-Quality Axion Dark Matter at Gravitational Wave Interferometers,"Disha Bandyopadhyay,Debasish Borah,Nayan Das,Rome Samanta",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational effects are known to violate global symmetries, threatening the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong CP problem. Ultraviolet completions featuring a gauged $U(1)$ symmetry, where $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ arises as an accidental global symmetry, can suppress Planck-suppressed operators, enabling high-quality axions in a mass window where it can also account for the observed dark matter (DM) in the Universe. We show that in such models, the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry generates a strong stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from gauge cosmic string loops. For breaking scales $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the SGWB signal strength exceeds astrophysical foregrounds across a broad frequency range. Contrary to conventional gauge cosmic string scenarios, such quality axion models have a characteristic IR break frequency originating from the collapse of string-wall network around axion oscillation temperature. We propose this characteristic SGWB frequency-amplitude region, identified as \textit{Signature-Window-Axion-Gravitational waves} (SWAG), to be a novel probe of high-quality axion DM at future space and ground-based interferometers.",
Cross submissions,Lepton Collider as a Window to Reheating via Freezing Out Dark Matter Detection,"Subhaditya Bhattacharya,Anupam Ghosh,Niloy Mondal,Abhik Sarkar",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate a particle dark matter (DM) scenario where the DM interaction with the Standard Model are mediated by a leptophilic effective operator. Unlike conventional WIMP scenarios where thermal freeze-out occurs in a radiation-dominated Universe, we consider DM freeze-out during a prolonged reheating epoch driven by inflaton decay. The resulting departure from standard cosmology alters the thermal evolution of the dark matter abundance, making it sensitive to the reheating temperature and the history of entropy injection. The leptophilic nature of the interaction, motivated by the absence of DM signals in the current LHC searches, suppresses couplings to quarks and gluons and instead enables viable DM-lepton interactions that remain largely unconstrained. Within this setup, we analyze the mono-Higgs plus missing energy channel at future lepton colliders where the same operator responsible for setting the relic abundance can be directly probed. We perform a detailed signal-background analysis using both polarized and unpolarized beams. Additionally, our results illustrate how collider experiments, when interpreted jointly with relic density constraints, can provide indirect hints of the Universe's thermal history, offering potential insights into the reheating temperature and the dynamics preceding Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.",
Cross submissions,"Unified Framework for Geodesic Dynamics with Conservative, Dissipative, and GUP Effects","Gaurav Bhandari,S. D. Pathak,Harjit Ghotra",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD),"We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Quantum-gravity effects are introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.",
Cross submissions,Geodesics and Light Deflection in Schwarzschild-like Spacetime from Cosmology-Inspired Modified Gravity,"Ritesh Pandey,Shubham Kala,Amare Abebe,Hemwati Nandan,G.G.L. Nashed",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate cosmology-driven modifications to Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetimes and analyze their impact on photon propagation, gravitational lensing, and shadow observation. The gravitational deflection angle is computed using the Rindler-Ishak method, which incorporates finite-distance corrections and provides a consistent framework for non-asym-ptotically flat spacetimes. The effective potential for null geodesics exhibits a single unstable maximum corresponding to the photon sphere, and we study photon orbits classified according to the critical impact parameter into capture, escape, and unstable circular trajectories. Our analysis shows that the deflection angle decreases with increasing model parameter $(\alpha)$, resulting in weaker light bending compared to the Schwarzschild case. In addition, we examine the angular diameter of the black hole shadow as measured by a static observer, highlighting its dependence on the cosmological modification parameters. These results suggest that high-precision astrometric and lensing observations can place meaningful constraints on cosmology-inspired modifications to gravity, thereby linking astrophysical black holes with cosmic expansion and offering a novel probe of gravitational physics in strong-field regimes.",
Cross submissions,Signature of axion dark matter in low-frequency terrestrial electromagnetic fields: formulation and predictions,"Atsushi Taruya,Atsushi Nishizawa,Yoshiaki Himemoto",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We develop a theoretical framework for axion dark matter (DM) searches using terrestrial electromagnetic (EM) fields. Axions couple to the geomagnetic field and generate a monochromatic EM signal at a frequency set by the axion mass. Incorporating a realistic atmospheric conductivity, we describe the axion-induced EM waves confined in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, avoiding the divergences present in idealized treatments. Our semi-analytical method yields quantitative predictions for the axion-induced magnetic field near the Earth's surface, and we found that (i) at $m_{\rm a} \gtrsim 10^{-14}$ eV, the signal exhibits resonance structures aligned with Schumann resonances, and the magnetic field amplitude is especially enhanced at $m_{\rm a} \sim 3 \times 10^{-14}$ eV. (ii) The signal amplitude and orientation also vary with geographic location, with Southeast Asia offering the strongest sensitivity. These predictions are insensitive to uncertainties in conductivity models and boundary conditions. Those distinctive features provide a reliable template to distinguish axion-induced signals from natural or anthropogenic EM backgrounds, and the formalism can be extended to other DM candidates such as dark photons.",
Cross submissions,Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions,V. V. Flambaum,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph),"Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).",
Cross submissions,Fine-grained dark matter substructure and axion haloscopes,"Ciaran A. J. O'Hare,Giovanni Pierobon",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The velocity distribution of cold dark matter within galaxies is expected to exhibit ultra-fine-grained substructure as a result of the many foldings of an initially smooth phase-space sheet under gravity. The innumerable folds of this sheet in the inner regions of a galactic halo would appear on solar-system scales like an extremely large number of spatially overlapping streams of dark matter particles. Some of these streams may also receive amplified densities if dark matter undergoes enhanced clustering in the early Universe, as is the case for axions in the post-inflationary scenario. This ultra-fine-grained dark matter substructure is usually considered irrelevant and undetectable for most direct detection experiments, but for axion haloscopes, this may not be the case. We develop and explore several plausible models for the degree of fine-grained axion dark matter substructure so as to evaluate its impact on the detectability of axions. We find that not only is this substructure detectable in haloscope experiments, but that it may enhance the detectability of the axion if data is analysed with a high-enough frequency resolution. This conclusion motivates ongoing high-resolution analyses of axion data by haloscope collaborations, which have the potential to reveal evidence of the QCD axion even if their nominal experimental sensitivity does not reach the required level under the Standard Halo Model assumption.",
Cross submissions,Importance of Shot Noise in the Search for an Isotropic Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background with Next Generation Detectors,"Haowen Zhong,Vuk Mandic",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We investigate the impact of shot noise on the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by binary neutron star mergers, and confirm that the overall background can be significantly influenced by relatively few neighboring, loud events. To mitigate the shot noise, we propose a procedure to remove nearby events by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Additionally, we quantify the cosmic/sample variance of the resulting background after notching, and we study the deviation between the cross-correlation measurement and the theoretical prediction of the background. Taking both effects into account, we find that the resulting sensitivity loss in the search for an isotropic background formed by binary neutron star mergers is minimal, and is limited to $\lesssim 4\%$ below 40 Hz, and to $\lesssim 1\%$ above 40 Hz.",
Cross submissions,Heterotic Warm Inflation,"Arjun Berera,Heliudson Bernardo,Suddhasattwa Brahma,Jaime Calderón-Figueroa,Rudnei O. Ramos,Michael W. Toomey",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this paper we propose a two-field model of warm inflation motivated from a heterotic string construction. The model contains an axion and a dilaton-like field. We show that while warm inflation can take place in the axion-field direction, thermal corrections coming from the radiation gauge fields, which couples to both the axion and the dilaton, prevent warm inflation to happen in the dilaton-field direction. We explore the background dynamics for different parameters, and identify a diversity of dynamical behaviors allowed in this model, denoting different regimes of warm inflation.",
