New submissions,Starobinsky in Stereo: SKA-CMB Synergy in SBI,"Benedikt Schosser,Caroline Heneka,Björn Malte Schäfer","Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)","Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations. We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky $R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical quantities.",
New submissions,Constraining fuzzy dark matter with the 21-cm power spectrum from Cosmic Dawn and Reionization,"Shihang Liu,Yilin Liu,Bowen Peng,Mengzhou Xie,Zelong Liu,Bohua Li,Yi Mao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The 21-cm signals from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization contain valuable information on cosmological structure formation dominated by dark matter. Measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum can thus probe certain dark matter candidates. Here we investigate the impacts of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on the 21-cm signals, taking into account both the linear matter power spectrum and the halo mass function (HMF) in FDM cosmologies. The full FDM dynamics are implemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation of the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM halos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic reionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark matter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm power spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a correct FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when X-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters from upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area). In FDM cosmologies with $m_\mathrm{FDM}=10^{-21}$ eV, SKA1-Low will be able to constrain the boson mass to within $\sim10$% at 2$\sigma$ confidence with a mock 1080-hour observation, if the ionizing efficiency is mass independent. However, our results show that realistic astrophysical processes are degenerate with the FDM effects, which shall severely loosen the constraints on the boson mass from 21-cm power spectrum data alone.",
New submissions,Machine learning analysis of Photometric data from the Dark Energy Survey,"Elcio Abdalla,Filipe B. Abdalla,Alessandro Marins,Amilcar Queiroz,Rafael M. Ribeiro,Alex S. C. Souza",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In order to retrieve cosmological parameters from photometric surveys, we need to estimate the distribution of the photometric redshift in the sky with excellent accuracy. We use and apply three different machine learning methods to publicly available Dark Energy Survey data release 2 (DR2): a) Artificial Neural Network for photometric redshifts (ANNz2); b) Gaussian processes for photometric redshifts (GPz); and c) Keras, a deep learning application programming interface in Python. We compare these different techniques applied to training data obtained from the VIPERS survey. To deal with the incompleteness of the VIPERS catalogue, we use a space-partitioning data structure (K-d Tree) to estimate the reliability of the obtained photometric redshifts. We build a catalogue which is robust to the lack of training data in certain regions of colour space. We use the photometric data to create maps of overdensity as a function of the redshift distribution for more than 500 million galaxies. These maps split the sky into several onion-like redshift slices, which can be readily used for cosmological parameter estimation. On each angular slice, we create and present maps of the angular distribution of galaxies in that slice as well as an estimate of the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, related to the galaxy distribution of that slice, which is recovered from the redshift estimation methods. We achieve a sub-sample of DES galaxies, which are well matched to the VIPERS sample with an accuracy of the photometric redshifts with a $\sigma_{68}\sim0.035$ and a catastrophic outlier rate of the order of 3 per cent.",
New submissions,SHH method for SIDM: An SIDM-hydro hybrid method for simulating self-interacting dark matter,"Sarah Schon,Michael Ryan,John Blakely,Jeysen Flores-Velazquez,Sarah Shandera,Donghui Jeong",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a new scheme to couple existing numerical methods for elastic self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) to the hydrodynamic equations via a continuous function of the local Knudsen number. The method, an SIDM-hydro hybrid (SHH), allows more efficient simulation of the evolution of inhomogeneous halos deep into the regime of gravothermal collapse. With the improved efficiency gained by moving to a hydrodynamical description in high-density regions, the SHH method allows central densities of two orders of magnitude higher to be reached in considerably less simulation time than traditional methods. Our implementation should be considered as the first step toward a robust SHH method, as we interpolate the first and second moments of the Boltzmann equation in the ideal-fluid limit only. The simulation results are qualitatively similar to those found with other methods, although there are differences in the implementation of the primary physics driving the dynamics, and in the details of the resulting halo profiles. However, our results indicate that the SHH technique shows promise to investigate gravothermal collapse in diverse, dynamical environments. The method can be extended to incorporate non-ideal fluid terms and dissipation, as needed for dark-matter scenarios where interactions beyond the elastic regime may be important in the dense interiors of some halos.",
New submissions,Precision Measurement of Large Shear Signals,"Jiarui Sun,Jun Zhang,Li Cui,Alessandro Sonnenfeld,Xin Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"So far, estimators of galaxy shape distortions are only carefully studied perturbatively in the case of small shear signals, mainly for weak lensing sciences. However, in the neighborhood of massive foreground clusters, a large number of background galaxies can be significantly distorted. The measurement of such large shear signals could be quite nontrivial under general observing conditions, i.e., in the presence of the point spread function (PSF) and noise. In this work, we propose a non-perturbative method to exactly recover large shear signals ($\gtrsim 0.5$) under general conditions. We test the method on simulated galaxy images, and find that it is accurate down to the very faint end.",
New submissions,Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data,"Himanshu Chaudhary,Salvatore Capozziello,Vipin Kumar Sharma,Isidro Gómez-Vargas,G. Mustafa",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift, and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0>-1$, $\omega_a<0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a<-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.",
New submissions,Parity violation in framework of nonmetricity gravity,"Zhiyuan Yu,Zhengsheng Yang,Taotao Qiu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way.",
New submissions,On frequentist confidence intervals in a non-Gaussian regime,"Shubham Barua,Shantanu Desai,Mauricio Lopez-Hernandez,Eoin Ó Colgáin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We study frequentist confidence intervals based on graphical profile likelihoods (Wilks' theorem, likelihood integration), and the Feldman-Cousins (FC) prescription, a generalisation of the Neyman belt construction, in a setting with non-Gaussian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors. Our simplified setting allows us to recycle the MCMC chain as an input in all methods, including mock simulations underlying the FC approach. We find all methods agree to within $10 \%$ in the close to Gaussian regime, but extending methods beyond their regime of validity leads to greater discrepancies. Importantly, we recover a $\sim 2 \sigma$ shift in cosmological parameters between low and high redshift cosmic chronometer data with the FC method, but only when one fits all parameters back to the mocks. We observe that fixing parameters, a common approach in the literature, risks underestimating confidence intervals.",
New submissions,Time-Dependent Deflection Reconstruction: A New Technique to Search for Gravitational Waves with the Cosmic Microwave Background,"Alvin Leluc,Joel Meyers,Alexander van Engelen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be applied to surveys at other wavelengths.",
New submissions,Scalar-induced gravitational waves with non-Gaussianity up to all orders,"Xiang-Xi Zeng,Zhuan Ning,Rong-Gen Cai,Shao-Jiang Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are ubiquitous in many early-Universe processes accompanied by non-Gaussianity; hence, precise calculations of SIGWs involve a full understanding of non-Gaussianity. In this Letter, we propose to use the lattice simulations to directly calculate the energy density spectra of SIGWs with non-Gaussianity up to all orders. Our proposal has been first verified to match the existing semi-analytical results with non-Gaussianity, and then applied to more general cases, including high-order primordial non-Gaussianities, the logarithmic dependence in curvature perturbations, the curvaton model, and the ultra slow-roll model. We find that even a modest non-Gaussianity can significantly alter ultraviolet behaviors in SIGW spectra, necessitating special cautions in future detections as well as mutual constraints on/from primordial black holes.",
New submissions,Accelerating cosmological inference of interacting dark energy with neural emulators,Karim Carrion,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The present thesis aims to tackle two critical aspects of present and future cosmological analysis of Large-Scale Structure (LSS): accurate modelling of the nonlinear matter power spectrum beyond $\Lambda$CDM, and efficient computational techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation. Both are crucial for testing alternative cosmologies and avoiding spurious results. We focus on the Dark Scattering (DS) model, describing pure momentum transfer between dark matter -- dark energy through the parameter $A_{\rm ds}$. To capture DS effects, we adopt the halo model reaction framework within $\tt{ReACT}$, compute the nonlinear DS spectrum, and validate it against $N$-body simulations. We further include baryonic feedback and massive neutrinos, finding degeneracies between DS and baryonic effects but not with neutrinos. We then constrain DS using cosmic shear from KiDS-1000, accelerated by neural emulators from $\tt{CosmoPower}$, which speed up predictions by $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$. Our DS emulator, trained on halo model reaction outputs, preserves percent-level accuracy and incorporates baryonic feedback. Analysing KiDS shear statistics, we obtain $\vert A_{\rm ds}\vert \lesssim 20$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L. Combining KiDS with Planck CMB and BAO data, we find $A_{\rm ds}=10.6^{+4.5}_{-7.3}$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L., suggesting the DS model as a promising resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Finally, we present weak lensing forecasts for Stage IV surveys using an automatically differentiable pipeline with $\tt{jax-cosmo}$ and gradient-based samplers in $\tt{NumPyro}$, reducing computational cost from months on CPUs to days on GPUs. Model evidence is evaluated with $\tt{harmonic}$ under multiple scale cuts. To put things into perspective, the modelling strategies and machine learning accelerations developed here provide powerful tools for the next generation of LSS cosmology.",
New submissions,"The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova Program: Cross Calibration, Simulations, and Cosmology Forecasts","Maria Acevedo,Nora R. Sherman,Dillon Brout,Bastien Carreres,Daniel Scolnic,Brodie Popovic,Patrick Armstrong,Dingyuan Cao,Rebecca C. Chen,Alex Drlica-Wagner,Peter S. Ferguson,Christopher Lidman,Bailey Martin,Erik R. Peterson,Adam G. Riess",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been essential for probing the nature of dark energy; however, most SN analyses rely on the same low-redshift sample, which may lead to shared systematics. In a companion paper (Sherman et al., submitted), we introduce the Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova (DEBASS) program, which has already collected more than 500 low-redshift SNe Ia on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), and present an initial release of 77 SNe Ia within the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint observed between 2021 and 2024. Here, we examine the systematics, including photometric calibration and selection effects. We find agreement at the 10 millimagnitude level among the tertiary standard stars of DEBASS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. Our simulations reproduce the observed distributions of DEBASS SN light-curve properties, and we measure a bias-corrected Hubble residual scatter of $0.08$ mag, which, while small, is found in 10% of our simulations. We compare the DEBASS SN distances to the Foundation sample and find consistency with a median residual offset of $0.016 \pm 0.019$ mag. Selection effects have negligible impacts on distances, but a different photometric calibration solution shifts the median residual $-0.015 \pm 0.019$ mag, highlighting calibration sensitivity. Using conservative simulations, we forecast that replacing historical low-redshift samples with the full DEBASS sample (>400 SNe Ia) will improve the statistical uncertainties on dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ by 30% and 24% respectively, enhance the dark energy Figure of Merit by up to 60%, and enable a measurement of $f\sigma_8$ at the 25% level.",
New submissions,"The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova Program: Motivation, Design, Implementation, and Preliminary Data Release","Nora F. Sherman,Maria Acevedo,Dillon Brout,Bailey Martin,Daniel Scolnic,Dingyuan Cao,Christopher Lidman,Noor Ali,Patrick Armstrong,K. Auchett,Rebecca C. Chen,Alex Drlica-Wagner,Peter S. Ferguson,Kenneth Herner,Gautham Narayan,Erik R. Peterson,Liana Rauf,Armin Rest,Adam G. Riess,Masao Sako,Brian Schmidt,Xianzhe TZ Tang,Brad E. Tucker",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Precise measurements of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at low redshifts ($z$) serve as one of the most viable keys to unlocking our understanding of cosmic expansion, isotropy, and growth of structure. The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernovae (DEBASS) program will deliver the largest uniformly calibrated low-$z$ SN Ia data set in the southern hemisphere to date. DEBASS utilizes the Dark Energy Camera to image supernovae in conjunction with the Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) to gather comprehensive host galaxy information. By using the same photometric instrument as both the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey, DEBASS not only benefits from a robust photometric pipeline and well-calibrated images across the southern sky, but can replace the historic and external low-$z$ samples that were used in the final DES supernova analysis. DEBASS has accumulated more than 400 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia in the redshift range of $0.01<z<0.08$ from 2021 to mid-2025, and, in this paper along with a companion paper Acevedo et al. submitted, we present an early data release of 77 SNe within the DES footprint to demonstrate the merit and constraining power of the data set. Here, we introduce the DEBASS program, discuss its scientific goals and the advantages it offers for supernova cosmology, and present our initial results. With this early data release, we find a robust median absolute standard deviation of Hubble diagram residuals of $\sim$0.10 mag and an initial measurement of the host-galaxy mass step of $0.06\pm0.04$ mag, both before performing bias corrections. This low scatter shows the promise of a low-$z$ SN Ia program with a well-calibrated telescope and high signal-to-noise ratio across multiple bands.",
New submissions,Web-Halo Model (WHM): Accurate non-linear matter power spectrum predictions without free parameters,"Samuel Brieden,Florian Beutler,Marcos Pellejero-Ibañez",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a parameter-free variant of the halo model that significantly improves the precision of matter clustering predictions, particularly in the challenging 1-halo to 2-halo transition regime, where standard halo models often fail. Unlike HMcode-2020, which relies on 12 phenomenological parameters, our approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy without any free fitting parameters. This new web-halo model (WHM) extends the traditional halo model by incorporating structures that have collapsed along two dimensions (filaments) and one dimension (sheets), in addition to haloes, and combines these with 1-loop Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (1$\ell$-LPT) in a consistent framework. We show that WHM matches N-body simulation power spectra within the precision of state-of-the-art emulators at the 2-halo to 1-halo transition regime at all redshifts. Specifically, the WHM achieves better than 2\% accuracy up to scales of $k = 0.4\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $0.7\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and $1.3\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z = 0.0$, $0.8$, and $1.5$, respectively, for both the baccoemu and EuclidEmu2 emulators, across their full $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM} + \sum m_\nu$ cosmological parameter space. This marks a substantial improvement over 1$\ell$-LPT and HMcode-2020, the latter of which performs similarly at low redshift but deteriorates at higher redshifts despite its 12 tuned parameters. We publicly release WHM as WHMcode, integrated into existing HMcode implementations for CAMB and CLASS.",
Cross submissions,Primordial Black Hole Formation and Spin in Matter Domination Revisited,"Weitao Ye,Yungui Gong,Tomohiro Harada,Zhaofeng Kang,Kazunori Kohri,Daiki Saito,Chul-Moon Yoo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this article, we calculate the mass distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the matter-dominated (MD) era by the peak theory. We apply the Zel'dovich approximation to track the nonlinear evolution of overdensities and compute the PBH abundance and mass function by incorporating a PBH formation criterion based on the hoop conjecture. We find that the PBH abundance $\beta$ follows the scaling law $\beta \simeq A_\gamma \sigma_h^{*5}$ for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$. Here, $\sigma_h^*$ is the quantity that characterizes the variance of the density fluctuation at the horizon entry. We also find that, in contrast to the previous estimates, the PBH spin is very small for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$ but could be larger for larger $\sigma_h^*$ and broader power spectra. Finally, specializing to a monochromatic power spectrum, we prove analytically that the PBH mass distribution becomes effectively monochromatic and reveal that the resultant PBH abundance is approximately 19 times the previous prediction.",
Cross submissions,Leptogenesis and neutrino mass with one right-handed neutrino and Higgs inflaton,"Disha Bandyopadhyay,Debasish Borah,Suruj Jyoti Das,Nobuchika Okada",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a novel and minimal setup where the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino oscillation data can be satisfied with only one right-handed neutrino (RHN) and a second Higgs doublet with the latter being also responsible for driving cosmic inflation. While inflation is realised via non-minimal coupling of the Higgs to gravity, baryon asymmetry is generated via Affleck-Dine leptogenesis. Due to the presence of only two new fields beyond the standard model (BSM), the proposed setup remains very predictive with only a small allowed parameter space consistent with the PLANCK 2018 and ACT 2025 data simultaneously. The preferred mass spectrum of the BSM particles also keeps the detection prospects alive at terrestrial experiments.",
