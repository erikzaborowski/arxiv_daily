New submissions,Efficient semi-analytic modelling of Pop III star formation from Cosmic Dawn to Reionization,"Sahil Hegde,Steven R. Furlanetto",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The quest to find the first stars has driven astronomers across cosmic time, from hopes to identify their signatures in their heyday at cosmic dawn to deep searches for their remnants in our local neighborhood. Such work crucially relies on robust theoretical modelling to understand when and where we expect pristine star formation to have occurred and survived. To that end, here we introduce an analytic bathtub for cosmic dawn, the abcd model, to efficiently trace the formation of the first stars from their birth through the first billion years of our universe's history, jointly following star formation out of pristine and metal-enriched gas over time. Informed by the latest theoretical developments in our understanding of star formation in molecular cooling halos, metal mixing, and early galaxies, we expand pre-existing minimal models for galaxy formation to include Population III stars and many of the processes - both internal and environmental - affecting their evolution, while remaining fast and interpretable. With this framework, we can bridge the gap between numerical simulations and previous semi-analytic models, as we self-consistently follow star formation in dark matter halos from the minihalo era through the epoch of reionization, finding that, under plausible physical conditions, pristine star formation can persist at a high level in the presence of Pop II star formation down to $z\sim 5$, but is limited to the most massive halos. We highlight areas of theoretical uncertainty in the physics underpinning Pop III star formation and demonstrate the effects of this uncertainty first on individual star formation histories and subsequently bracketing the range of global star formation levels we expect. Finally, we leverage this model to make preliminary observable predictions, generating forecasts for high-$z$ luminosity functions, transient rates, and the 21-cm global signal.",
New submissions,Testing the AGN unified model with simulated emission lines from the circumgalactic medium (CGM),"Shiwu Zhang,Zheng Cai,Aura Obreja,Fabrizio Arrigoni Battaia,Léo Michel-Dansac,Jérémy Blaizot,Donghui Quan,Mingyu Li",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The CGM around unobscured AGN has received much attention in recent years. Comparatively, nebulae associated with obscured AGN are less studied. Here, we simulate the Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and HeII nebulae around the two types of AGN at $z=2-3$ with ten massive systems from the FIRE simulations based on the unified model to show their differences and to test if they can be used to constrain the AGN model. We post-process the data with the CLOUDY and the Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer code, RASCAS. Overall, we find that the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around the unobscured AGN (type-I nebulae) and obscured AGN (type-II nebulae) do not exhibit significant differences in the luminosity, area, and HeII/Ly$\alpha$ when the simulated cutout is set to the halo virial radius. Whereas, the type-II nebulae exhibit less symmetric morphologies, flatter surface brightness profiles, and larger emission line widths (at $R\geq 10$ kpc) than those of the type-I nebulae. These nebulae properties exhibit complicated correlations with the AGN, indicating that nebulae observations can be applied to constrain the AGN engine. However, independent observations on nebulae in the mentioned emissions are insufficient to test the unified model as a priori in observations is not possible to know the direction and opening angle of the ionization cone. We prompt that the joint observations of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae and radio jets can help to reveal the ionization cone to probe the unified model. Our calculations suggest that this method requires $\geq 75$ type-II Ly$\alpha$ nebulae with current instruments to reach a confidence level of $\geq 95\%$.",
New submissions,Bound dark energy: Particle origin of dark energy with DESI BAO and DES supernova data,"Jose Agustin Lozano Torres,Axel de la Macorra",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy at a significance level above $2.5 \sigma$, with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data, favoring a time dependent equation of state $w(z)$ rather than the cosmological constant ($w = -1$). We introduce the Bound Dark Energy (BDE) model, in which dark energy arises from the lightest meson field $\phi$ in a dark SU(3) gauge group, developing dynamically through non perturbative interactions. Governed by an inverse power law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_c^{4+2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$, BDE features no dark energy free parameters: one less than $\Lambda$CDM ($\Lambda$) and three less than the $ w_{0}w_{a} $CDM ($ w_{0}, w_{a},\Lambda $) models. By integrating DESI BAO measurements, CMB data and Dark Energy Survey SN Ia distance data collected during the fifth year, BDE demonstrates a reduction of $42$ and $37$ percent in the reduced $\chi^{2}_{BAO}$ as well as lower AIC and BIC values compared to the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM models, respectively, while maintaining a comparable fit for both type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background data. Although the ($w_{0},w_{a}$) contour in BDE is 10,000 times smaller than that found in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model, the BDE model suggests a dynamical dark energy scenario with precise values of $w_{0}=$-0.9301 $\pm$ 0.0004 and $w_{a}=$ -0.8085 $\pm$ 0.0053 while providing a consistency on the six Planck and derived parameters at the 1$\sigma$ level between BDE, $\Lambda$CDM and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. The critical parameters condensation energy scale $\Lambda_{c} = 43.806 \pm 0.190$ eV and epoch $a_{c} = (2.497 \pm 0.011) \times 10^{-6}$ are consistent with predictions from high energy physics.",
New submissions,Cosmological observational tests in the JWST Era I: angular size - redshift,"A. A. Raikov,V. V. Tsymbal,N. Yu. Lovyagin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This study is denoted to the cosmological ""angular size - redshift"" test. An analysis is performed of the angular and linear sizes of galaxies from the new ASTRODEEP-JWST catalogue, which contains over 500,000 objects at high redshifts (up to ~20 photometrically determined and up to ~14 spectroscopically determined). For the calculations, 6 860 galaxies with reliably determined spectroscopic redshifts and 319,771 galaxies with known photometric redshifts were used. The linear sizes of galaxies were computed within the framework of two cosmological models - the standard ({\Lambda}CDM) model and one of the static models (the so-called ""tired light"" model). We shown that within the framework of the {\Lambda}CDM model, a significant evolution of the linear sizes of galaxies is observed, with the rate of the evolution closely matching the rate of the cosmic expansion. In contrast, in the static model, the characteristic linear sizes of a galaxies exhibit almost no evolution with increasing z.",
New submissions,From South to North: Leveraging Ground-Based LATs for Full-Sky CMB Delensing and Constraints on $r$,"Wen-Zheng Chen,Yang Liu,Yi-Ming Wang,Hong Li",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Delensing--the process of mitigating the lensing-induced B-mode contamination in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations--will be a pivotal challenge for next-generation CMB experiments seeking to detect primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) through B-mode polarization. This process requires an accurate lensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction from high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for internal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to the southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this work, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to be situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing performance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a space-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT (SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an important role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive polarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere internal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared to the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing, achieving a further ~19% reduction--comparable to that from including LSS tracers (~17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers drops to ~10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in advancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.",
New submissions,Directional Neutrino Bursts from Spinning and Moving Primordial Black Holes,"Arnab Chaudhuri,Priya Mishra,Rukmani Mohanta",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) with significant spin and bulk motion produce sharply collimated neutrino bursts from Hawking evaporation, arising from the interplay of spin-induced angular anisotropy and relativistic Doppler boosting. This effect shifts the neutrino spectrum into the multi-GeV to hundreds of GeV range, where atmospheric backgrounds drop steeply, and enhances the flux by orders of magnitude within a narrow forward cone. We compute the full lab-frame neutrino distribution and derive updated constraints on PBH number density from non-observation of such bursts in IceCube and KM3NeT. Our results identify directional high-energy neutrino bursts as a distinctive, testable signature of spinning PBHs, providing a complementary probe of the PBH dark matter hypothesis and Hawking radiation.",
New submissions,Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Multi-Messenger Systematics and Prospects with Next-Generation Facilities,"Nathan Steinle,Samar Safi-Harb,Matt Nicholl,Isabelle Worssam,Benjamin P. Gompertz",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework in anticipation of future GW and EM detectors. We demonstrate how combining models of different aspects of the BNS progenitor-merger-remnant system into a full multi-messenger modeling pipeline reveals insight into modeling challenges that will need to be addressed in the coming decade of multi-messenger astronomy. Motivated by GW170817, this combined model relates the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We find joint correlations between the GW and EM observables that depend on a complicated interplay between modeling assumptions and theoretical uncertainties. Next generation detectors will generically provide multi-messenger constraints on BNSs with median GW network signal-to-noise ratio $\approx 10$, median of the 90$^{\rm th}$ percentile sky area $\approx 10$ sq. deg., and kilonova $i$-band apparent magnitudes ranging from $\approx 33$ to $23$. We find no more than 4\% of the BNSs are simultaneously detectable by a network of two Cosmic Explorers and one Einstein Telescope and by the Roman and Rubin telescopes for 55 and 180 sec. exposures in a $K$-like band and $i$ and $g$ bands, respectively. We discuss key modeling assumptions that will be transmitted as multi-messenger systematics in the analysis of future datasets, such as uncertain astrophysical processes of binary populations and the nuclear equation of state for tests of nuclear physics and dark matter.",
New submissions,Future Parameter Constraints from Weak Lensing CMB and Galaxy Lensing Power- and Bispectra,"Jonas Frugte,P. Daniel Meerburg",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Upcoming stage 4 surveys, such as the Simons Observatory, LSST, and Euclid, are poised to measure weak gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and galaxies with unprecedented precision. While the power spectrum is the standard statistic used to analyze weak lensing data, non-Gaussianity from non-linear structure growth encodes additional cosmological information in higher-order statistics. We forecast the ability of future surveys to constrain cosmological parameters using the weak lensing power spectrum and bispectrum from both CMB and galaxy surveys, including their cross-correlations. We consider an eight-parameter model ($\Lambda$CDM + $\sum m_\nu$ + $w_0$) and assess constraints for stage 4 survey specifications. In the absence of systematics, both the CMB and galaxy lensing bispectra are found to be detectable at high signal-to-noise. We test two priors: a ''strong'' one based on constraints from CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization anisotropies, and a ''weak'' one with minimal assumptions. With the weak prior, the bispectrum significantly improves parameter constraints by breaking degeneracies. For strong priors, improvements are more limited, especially for the CMB bispectrum. On small scales, where non-linear effects dominate, the bispectrum's constraining power can rival that of the power spectrum. We also find strong synergy between CMB and galaxy lensing; combining both probes leads to tighter constraints, particularly on neutrino mass. It was recently found that the CMB lensing bispectrum is strongly affected by the Born approximation, so we also consider post-Born corrections but find that our main conclusions remain the same. These results highlight the potential of higher-order lensing statistics and motivate further work on neglected effects such as non-Gaussian covariance, instrumental systematics, and baryonic feedback.",
New submissions,A Comparative Study of Halo Mass Estimates from Group Catalogs and Lensing Signals,"Xinyue Chen,Weiwei Xu,Ran Li,Huanyuan Shan,Ji Yao,Chunxiang Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We compare halo mass estimates from three galaxy group catalogs (redMaPPer, Yang21, and Zou21) with those derived from gravitational lensing measurements. Each catalog employs distinct methodologies, including mass-richness relations, abundance matching, and luminosity-based calibration. A linear correlation is observed between catalog-estimated and lensing-derived masses. The redMaPPer catalog shows the best agreement, especially for lower-redshift groups, with minor deviations in higher-redshift bins. Yang21 is the only catalog containing low mass groups, which gives a reasonably good mass estimation, except for the lowest mass bin. Cross-matched groups between redMaPPer and Yang21 reveal the former catalog provides more accurate mass estimation, while the Yang21 makes under-estimation of halo mass for those sharing the central galaxy with redMaPPer and over-estimation of halo mass for those with different center determination with redMaPPer and for the unique Yang21 groups. These findings emphasize the importance of redshift-dependent calibration and refined group definitions for accurate mass estimation.",
New submissions,Gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts: prospects for probing microlens populations in lensing galaxies,"Ashish Kumar Meena,Prasenjit Saha",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational lensing by a stellar microlens of mass $M$ forms two images separated by micro-arcseconds on the sky and has a time delay of $2\times10^{-5}(M/{\rm M_\odot})$ seconds. Although we cannot resolve such micro-images in the sky, they could be resolved in time if the source is a fast radio burst (FRB). In this work, we study the magnification ($|\mu|$) and time delay~($t_d$) distributions of micro-images led by different microlens populations. We find that, in microlensing of typical strongly lensed (macro-)images in galaxy lenses, micro-images stemmed from a population of stellar mass microlenses in the $[0.08, 1.5]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range and a second (dark) microlens population in $[10^{-3} - 10^{-2}]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range reside in different parts of $|\mu|-t_d$ plane. For the global minimum macro-image, due to low stellar mass density, we find that the stellar population leads to peaks in autocorrelation at ${>}10^{-6}$ seconds, whereas the secondary population leads to peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, allowing us to differentiate different microlens populations. However, an increase in stellar density introduces new peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, which can pollute the inference about the presence of multiple microlens populations. In addition, we also show that the number of micro-images, hence the number of peaks in the autocorrelation, is also sensitive to the underlying stellar mass function, allowing us to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with FRB microlesning in the future. This work is a first step towards using FRB lensing to probe the microlens population within strong lenses, and more detailed studies are required to assess the effect of various uncertainties that we only discussed qualitatively.",
New submissions,Superhorizon fluctuations and the cosmic dipole problem,"Ge Chen,Chengcheng Han,Linwei Qiu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Recent observations have identified a significant 4.9$\sigma$ tension between the cosmic dipole inferred from galaxy number counts and that derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), suggesting a potential deviation from the cosmological principle. This work investigates whether superhorizon isocurvature perturbations in cold dark matter (CDM) can account for this discrepancy. We demonstrate that, unlike adiabatic modes which cancel at leading order, superhorizon isocurvature modes can generate an intrinsic CMB dipole without significantly affecting galaxy number counts, thereby explaining the observed mismatch. We explore both single-mode and continuous-spectrum cases, focusing on two concrete models: a nearly scale-invariant power-law spectrum with a UV cutoff and axion-induced isocurvature perturbations. For the axion scenario, we show that if the radial mode evolves during inflation, the resulting perturbations can match the required amplitude while evading current CMB constraints. Our analysis constrains the self-coupling of associated potential for the axion to the range $10^{-9} < \lambda < 4 \times 10^{-9}$. These findings offer a viable solution to the dipole tension and may serve as indirect evidence for axion dark matter.",
New submissions,Do Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies Follow the Globular Cluster-Halo Mass Relation?,"Duncan A. Forbes,Jonah S. Gannon",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The stellar mass-halo mass relation and the globular cluster (GC) number-halo mass relation are two scaling relations that relate fundamental properties of normal galaxies. Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), some of which, have rich GC systems and relatively low stellar masses can not follow the mean trend of both relations simultaneously; it is thus important to understand which relationship is followed by UDGs. Using independent halo masses determined from kinematic fitting to large radii, we identify three UDGs and two UDG-like galaxies from the literature and examine which scaling relation they follow. We find that the galaxies follow the GC number-halo mass relation but deviate in a systematic way from the stellar mass-halo mass relation, which depends on their GC count. This scatter off the relation is towards higher halo masses, or equivalently lower stellar masses. The galaxies exhibiting the largest offsets may represent `failed galaxies' that have experienced quenched star formation with later assembly.",
New submissions,"Fast and ""lossless"" propagation of relativistic electrons along magnetized non-thermal filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region","Eugene Churazov,Lawrence Rudnick,Ildar Khabibullin,Marisa Brienza,Alex Schekochihin,Dmitri Uzdensky",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation (synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting at ~GHz frequencies to t<100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$) Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfvén speed, $v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments, electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their velocity is not limited by the Alfvén or sound speeds of the ambient thermal plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as $P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized. While some of these structures can be observed as ""filaments"", i.e., long and narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still providing channels for electrons' propagation.",
New submissions,The Concordance of Weak Lensing and Escape Velocity Mass Estimates for Galaxy Clusters,"Alexander Rodriguez,Christopher J. Miller",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the masses of the galaxy clusters inferred using background galaxies via weak-lensing shear should agree with the masses measured using the galaxy projected radius-velocity phase-space data via the escape velocity profile. However, prior work indicates that the correlation between caustic-inferred escape masses and weak lensing masses is statistically consistent with zero. Based on recent advancements in the measurement of the escape edge and its physical interpretation, we conduct a revised comparison between these two independent mass inference techniques for 46 galaxy clusters between $0.05 \le z \le 0.3$ and over an order of magnitude in mass, $14.4 \le {\rm log}_{10} M/M_{\odot} \le 15.4$. We find excellent agreement, with a correlation ($0.679^{+0.046}_{-0.049}$), and a mean relative difference between the two mass measurements consistent with zero (0.02 $\pm$ 0.02 dex). The observed scatter between these direct mass estimates is 0.17 dex and is consistent with the reported individual mass errors, suggesting that there is no need for an additional intrinsic component. We discuss the important practical consequences of these results, focusing on the systematic uncertainties inherent to each technique, and their implications for cosmology.",
New submissions,"Survival of higher overdensity cold gas in a turbulent, multiphase medium","Ashwin Vergis George,Hitesh Kishore Das,Max Gronke",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Cold gas clouds embedded in a hot, turbulent medium are expected to be short-lived due to disruptive hydrodynamic instabilities. However, radiative cooling might allow such clouds to survive and grow. We present 3D \texttt{Athena++} simulations of clouds with a density contrast of $\chi = 1000$, exploring turbulent Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}\in (0.25, 0.75)$ and cloud radii chosen to span cooling-to-crushing ratios $\alpha \in [0.001, 10]$. We find a shift in the survival boundary, with cloud survival occurring only when the cooling-to-cloud-crushing ratio ($t_{\text{cool,mix}} / t_{\text{cc}}$) $\lesssim 0.01$, which is lower than the expected boundary of $\sim 1$. This result shows that it is more difficult for higher over-density cold clouds to survive in a turbulent, hot medium, and suggests another `survival criterion'.",
New submissions,PyBird-JAX: Accelerated inference in large-scale structure with model-independent emulation of one-loop galaxy power spectra,"Alexander Reeves,Pierre Zhang,Henry Zheng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a differentiable, $\texttt{JAX}$-based implementation of $\texttt{PyBird}$, using internal neural network emulators to accelerate computationally costly operations for rapid large-scale structure (LSS) analysis. $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ computes one-loop EFTofLSS predictions for redshift-space galaxy power spectrum multipoles in 1.2 ms on a CPU and 0.2 ms on a GPU, achieving 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-up over $\texttt{PyBird}$. The emulators take a compact spline-based representation of the input linear power spectrum $P(k)$ as feature vectors, making the approach applicable to a wide range of cosmological models. We rigorously validate its accuracy against large-volume simulations and on BOSS data, including cosmologies not explicitly represented in the training set. Leveraging automatic differentiation, $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ supports Fisher forecasting, Taylor expansion of model predictions, gradient-based searches, and vectorised ensemble sampling. Interfaced with a variety of samplers and Boltzmann solvers, $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ provides a high-performance, end-to-end inference pipeline. Combined with a symbolic-$P(k)$ generator, a typical Stage-4 LSS MCMC converges in minutes on a GPU. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ delivers the precision and speed required for upcoming LSS surveys, opening the door to accelerated cosmological inference with minimal accuracy loss and no pretraining. In a companion paper [1], we put $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ to use in achieving LSS marginalised constraints free from volume projection effects through non-flat measures.",
New submissions,Debiasing inference in large-scale structure with non-flat volume measures,"Alexander Reeves,Pierre Zhang,Henry Zheng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Increasingly large parameter spaces, used to more accurately model precision observables in physics, can paradoxically lead to large deviations in the inferred parameters of interest -- a bias known as volume projection effects -- when marginalising over many nuisance parameters. For posterior distributions that admit a Laplace expansion, we show that this artefact of Bayesian inference can be mitigated by defining expectation values with respect to a non-flat volume measure, such that the posterior mean becomes unbiased on average. We begin by finding a measure that ensures the mean is an unbiased estimator of the mode. Although the mode itself, as we rediscover, is biased under sample averaging, this choice yields the least biased estimator due to a cancellation we clarify. We further explain why bias in marginal posteriors can appear relatively large, yet remains correctable, when the number of nuisances is large. To demonstrate our approach, we present mock analyses in large-scale structure (LSS) wherein cosmological parameters are subject to large projection effects (at the 1-2$\sigma$ level) under a flat measure, that are however recovered at high fidelity ($<0.1\sigma$) when estimated using non-flat counterparts. Our cosmological analyses are enabled by $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a fast, differentiable pipeline for LSS developed in our companion paper [1].",
New submissions,Primordial Black Hole Triggered Type Ia Supernovae I: Impact on Explosion Dynamics and Light Curves,"Shing-Chi Leung,Seth Walther,Ken'ichi Nomoto,Alexander Kusenko",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves which align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.",

Zhu",Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.",

In this work, we study the detectability of the resulting gravitational signal for a number of current and future GW observatories.

Predictions for both phases can be significantly improved by employing numerically computed results compared to the slow-roll approximations. These results enable a more accurate reassessment of the observational viability of inflationary models, provide tighter constraints on the reheating history, and help lift the degeneracies in the predictions of inflation and reheating dynamics. Given current observational bounds, this enables a more accurate understanding of the early universe physics.",
Cross submissions,Fuzzy dark matter soliton as gravitational lens,Ke Wang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM) solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$. Therefore, this FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge $\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently, this small magnification factor in that large magnification zone means a small antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background, even though this antisotropy is out of the sensitivity of the pulsar timing arrays today.",

Wang,Leander Thiele",Machine Learning (cs.LG); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a set-based machine learning framework that infers posterior distributions of galaxy cluster masses from projected galaxy dynamics. Our model combines Deep Sets and conditional normalizing flows to incorporate both positional and velocity information of member galaxies to predict residual corrections to the $M$-$\sigma$ relation for improved interpretability. Trained on the Uchuu-UniverseMachine simulation, our approach significantly reduces scatter and provides well-calibrated uncertainties across the full mass range compared to traditional dynamical estimates.",
Cross submissions,Dark photon dark matter from flattened axion potentials,"Hong-Yi Zhang,Paola Arias,Andrew Cheek,Enrico D. Schiappacasse,Luca Visinelli,Leszek Roszkowski",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS),"Dark photons can be resonantly produced in the early universe via their coupling to an oscillating axion field. However, this mechanism typically requires large axion-dark photon couplings or some degree of fine-tuning. In this work, we present a new scenario in which efficient dark photon production arises from axion potentials that are shallower than quadratic at large field values. For moderately large initial misalignment angles, the oscillation of the axion field can trigger either efficient dark photon production or strong axion self-resonance via parametric resonance. When self-resonance dominates and disrupts the field's homogeneity, we show that oscillons -- localized, oscillating axion field configurations -- naturally form and can sustain continued dark photon production, provided the coupling is $\gtrsim \mathcal O(1)$. For dark photon mass up to three orders of magnitude below the axion mass, the produced dark photons can account for a significant fraction of the present-day dark matter. We support this scenario with numerical lattice simulations of a benchmark model. Our results further motivate experimental searches for ultralight dark photon dark matter. The simulation code is publicly available atthis https URL.",
Cross submissions,Maximal parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter with lepton asymmetries,"Kensuke Akita,Koichi Hamaguchi,Maksym Ovchynnikov",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Large lepton flavor asymmetries with zero total lepton asymmetry could be generated in the Early Universe. They are loosely constrained by current observations, being washed out at MeV temperatures by neutrino oscillations. We show that such lepton flavor asymmetries open up a new parameter space for sterile neutrino dark matter, consistent with all observational bounds. To this end, we construct the semi-classical Boltzmann equation for sterile neutrinos applicable in the case of arbitrarily large lepton asymmetries, and confirm its validity by quantum kinetic equations. This way, we derive the maximal parameter space for sterile neutrino dark matter with lepton asymmetries. The allowed range of sterile neutrinos' squared couplings extends by up to two orders of magnitude across a 5-70 keV mass range, and may be testable by X-ray, structure formation, and upcoming CMB observations.",
Cross submissions,GW231123: Binary Black Hole Merger or Cosmic String?,"Iuliu Cuceu,Marie Anne Bizouard,Nelson Christensen,Mairi Sakellariadou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported an exceptional gravitational-wave event, GW231123. This gravitational-wave signal was assumed to be generated from the merger of a binary black hole system, with source frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17}~\textup{M}_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}~ \textup{M}_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals). As seen by the two LIGO detectors, the signal has only $\sim 5$ cycles, between 30 and 80 Hz, over $\sim 10$ ms. It is of critical importance to confirm the origin of this signal. Here we present the results of a Bayesian model comparison to test whether the gravitational-wave signal was actually generated by a binary black hole merger, or emitted from cusps or kinks on a cosmic string. We find significant evidence for a binary black hole merger origin of the signal.",
