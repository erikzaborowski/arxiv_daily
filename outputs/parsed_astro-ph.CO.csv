New submissions,Cosmological Constraints on Secluded Dark Radiation,"Jae Hyeok Chang,Peizhi Du,Subhajit Ghosh,Soubhik Kumar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Dark radiation (DR) is ubiquitous in physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), and its interactions with the SM and dark matter (DM) lead to a variety of interesting effects on cosmological observables. However, even in scenarios where DR is 'secluded', i.e., only gravitationally interacting with SM and DM, it can leave discernible signatures. We present a comprehensive study of four different types of DR: free-streaming, self-interacting (coupled), decoupling, and recoupling DR, and vary initial conditions to include both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. In addition to these properties, we also vary neutrino energy density, DR energy density, and the SM neutrino masses to perform a general analysis and study degeneracies among neutrino and DR properties. We derive constraints using the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, and supernova datasets. We find no significant preference for physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model, but data exhibit interesting interplays between different physical quantities. When the neutrino energy density is allowed to vary, we find that the cosmological dataset prefers massless free-streaming DR over massive neutrinos, leading to a significant relaxation of the neutrino mass bound. Although we do not find any evidence of DR isocurvature, the data show support for a strong blue tilt of the isocurvature power spectrum. Our analysis also highlights the degeneracy of various DR parameters with the Hubble constant $H_0$ resulting in a mild relaxation of the $H_0$ tension.",
New submissions,"Planes of satellites, at once transient and persistent",Till Sawala(1) ((1) University of Helsinki),Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The appearance of highly anisotropic planes of satellites around the Milky Way and other galaxies was long considered a challenge to the standard cosmological model. Recent simulations have shown such planes to be common, but they have been described as either ""transient"", short-lived alignments, or ""persistent"", long-lived structures. Here we analyse Milky Way analogue systems in the cosmological simulation TNG-50 to resolve this apparent contradiction. We show that, as the satellite populations of individual hosts rapidly change, the observed anisotropies of their satellite systems are invariably short-lived, with lifetimes of no more than a few hundred million years. However, when the progenitors of the same satellites are traced backwards, we find examples where those identified to form a plane at the present day have retained spatial coherence over several Gyr. The two ostensibly conflicting predictions for the lifetimes of satellite planes can be reconciled as two perspectives on the same phenomenon.",
New submissions,Simulating Spectral Confusion in SPHEREx Photometry and Redshifts,"Zhaoyu Huai,James J. Bock,Yun-Ting Cheng,Jean Choppin de Janvry,Sean Bruton,James R. Cheshire IV,Brendan P. Crill,Olivier Doré,Spencer W. Everett,Andreas L. Faisst,Richard M. Feder,Woong-Seob Jeong,Yongjung Kim,Bomee Lee,Daniel C. Masters",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We model the impact of source confusion on photometry and the resulting spectrophotometric redshifts for SPHEREx, a NASA Medium-Class Explorer that is carrying out an all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. Spectral confusion from untargeted background galaxies degrades sensitivity and introduces a spectral bias. Using interpolated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the COSMOS2020 catalog, we construct a Monte Carlo library of confusion spectra that captures the cumulative impact from faint galaxies. By injecting confusion realizations into galaxy SEDs and performing forced photometry at known source positions, we quantify photometric and redshift error and bias. For our current expected selection of sources for the cosmology analysis, we find typical 1-$\sigma$ confusion levels range from $0.8-3.8\ \mu\mathrm{Jy}$ across $0.75-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. While negligible at full-sky survey depth, spectral confusion becomes significant in the SPHEREx deep fields, reducing the number of intermediate-precision redshifts and inducing a small systematic overestimation in redshift. In parallel, we also model targeted source blending from beam overlaps, which contributes additional photometric noise without systematic redshift bias, provided that positions are known exactly. Together, confusion and blending vary with the depth of the selected reference sample, revealing a trade-off, where deeper selections reduce confusion but increase blending-induced noise. Our methodology informs optimization of the SPHEREx deep-field selection strategy and future treatments of stellar source blending and confusion.",
New submissions,13 Billion Years of MgII Absorber Evolution,"Christopher W. Churchill(1),Asif Abbas(1),Glenn G. Kapcrzak(2),Nikole M. Nielsen(2,3) ((1) New Mexico State University, (2) Swinburne University of Technology, (3) University of Oklahoma)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Applying ""apportioned integrals,"" we use dN/dX measurements to determine the MgII absorber equivalent width distribution function for Wr > 0.03 [angstroms] and 0 < z < 7. Adopting a Schechter distribution, f(z,W)dW = Phi* (W/W*)^alpha e^{-W/W*} dW/W*, we present the normalization, Phi*(z), the characteristic equivalent width, W*(z), and the weak-end slope, alpha(z), as smooth functions of redshift. Measurements of dN/dX are robust for z < 4 but less so at z > 4 for weaker absorbers (Wr < 0.3 [angstroms]). We bracketed two data-driven scenarios: from z ~ 7 to z ~ 4, dN/dX of weak absorbers is (1) constant, or (2) decreasing. For scenario #1, the evolution of Phi*(z), W*(z), and alpha(z) show that in the post-reionization universe, weak systems are nonevolving while the incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following Cosmic Noon, the strongest absorbers slowly evolve away while the incidence of weak absorbers rapidly increases. For scenario #2, the parameter evolution is such that, in the post-reionization universe, weak systems evolve away while the incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following Cosmic Noon, the behavior tracks the same as scenario #1. We argue in favor of scenario #2 based on corroborating OI, CII, and SiII measurements at z > 4. Our results provide a unified, quantitative description for MgII absorber evolution spanning 13 billion years of cosmic time and offer deeper insights into galactic baryon cycle physics. They also highlight the need for deep z > 5 MgII surveys and have implications for detectability of a MgII forest at z > 7.",
New submissions,Feeding frenzy in the mighty black holes: what we could learn from them?,"Swayamtrupta Panda,Hygor Benati Gonçalves,Thaisa Storchi-Bergmann,Marzena Śniegowska,Bożena Czerny,Edi Bon,Paola Marziani,Nataša Bon,Alberto Rodríguez Ardila,Daniel May,Marcos Fonseca Faría,Luciano Fraga,Francisco Pozo Nuñez,Eduardo Bañados,Jochen Heidt,Karla Garnica,Deborah Dultzin",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.",
New submissions,Strong Lensing Perturbers from the SIDM Concerto Suite,"Demao Kong,Ethan O. Nadler,Hai-Bo Yu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Motivated by recent detections of low-mass perturbers in strong gravitational lensing systems, we investigate analogs of these objects in the Concerto suite, a set of cosmological N-body zoom-in simulations of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with high-amplitude, velocity-dependent cross sections. We investigate characteristic halo properties relevant to gravitational imaging measurements, focusing on the projected enclosed mass and the central density slope. In SIDM, these quantities evolve continuously through gravothermal processes, spanning core-expansion and core-collapse phases, in sharp contrast to cold dark matter, where they remain nearly static after halo formation. This SIDM evolution further depends on tidal environment and merger history, which can be probed through strong lensing. We also identify simulated SIDM halos whose properties are consistent with the properties of low-mass perturbers inferred from recent observations, and we demonstrate that the core-collapse mechanism offers a compelling explanation for their observed high densities. Our results highlight the potential of strong gravitational lensing as a powerful probe of dark matter self-interactions.",
New submissions,Realistic Oscillon Interactions,"Angela Xue,Kyle Chen,Baylee Verzyde,Peter Hayman,Richard Easther",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Oscillons are long-lived nonlinear pseudo-solitonic configurations of scalar fields and many plausible inflationary scenarios predict an oscillon-dominated phase in the early universe. Many possible aspects of this phase remain unexplored, particularly oscillon-oscillon interactions and interactions between oscillons and their environment. However the primary long range forces between oscillons are gravitational and thus slow-acting relative to the intrinsic timescales of the oscillons themselves. Given that simulations with local gravity are computationally expensive we explore these effects by extracting individual specimens from simulations and then engineering interactions. We find that oscillons experience friction when moving in an inhomogeneous background and, because oscillons in non-relativistic collisions bounce or merge as a function of their relative phases, the outcomes of interactions between ``wild'' oscillons depend on their specific trajectories.",
New submissions,The Disk Plus (Failed) Wind System of 3C 47: A Story of Accretion Disks and Binary Black Holes,"P. Marziani,S. Terefe Mengistue,A. del Olmo,M. Povič,J. Perea,S. Komossa,E. Bon,N. Bon,L. Č. Popovič,A. Deconto-Machado,I. Marquez,M. A. Martínez Carballo",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"[Abridged] Optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disks around supermassive black holes are thought to contribute to broad-line emission in type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, observed emission line profiles most often deviate from those expected from a rotating disk. This report examines the role of accretion disks in broad-line emission of Population B AGN characterized by relatively low accretion rates in which broad lines show large redward asymmetry both in H$\beta$ and Mg II$\lambda$ 2800. An unbiased comparison matching black hole mass and Eddington ratio suggests that the most powerful radio-loud quasars show the highest red-ward asymmetries in H$\beta$. These shifts can be accounted for by gravitational and transverse redshift effects, especially for black hole masses larger than $\approx$10$^{8.7}$ M$_\odot$. The analysis of the extremely jetted quasar 3C 47 adds another piece to the puzzle: not only are the low ionization profiles of 3C 47 well-described by a relativistic Keplerian accretion disk model, with line emission in the range 100 - 1,000 gravitational radii, but also the high-ionization line profiles can be understood as a combination of disk plus a failed wind contribution that is in turn hiding the disk emission. Constraints on radio properties and line profile variability suggest that 3C 47 might involve the presence of a second black hole with secondary-to-primary mass ratio $\sim$ 0.5. We conjecture that the double peakers - type-1 AGN with Balmer line profiles consistent with accretion disk emission - might have their emission truncated by the sweeping effect of a second black hole. In non-starving systems, the disk signal is plausibly masked by additional line emission, rendering the disk contribution harder to detect.",
New submissions,BAO miscalibration cannot rescue late-time solutions to the Hubble tension,"Davide Pedrotti,Luis A. Escamilla,Valerio Marra,Leandros Perivolaropoulos,Sunny Vagnozzi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil's advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension ""no-go theorem"", and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.",
New submissions,Strong-lensing rates of massive black hole binaries in LISA,"Juan Gutiérrez,Macarena Lagos",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Similarly to electromagnetic (EM) signals, gravitational lensing by intervening galaxies can also affect gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we estimate the strong-lensing rate of massive black hole mergers observed with LISA. Given the uncertainties in the source populations as well as in the population of galaxies at high redshift, we consider: six different source population models, including light and heavy seeds, as well as three lens population models, including redshift-independent and redshift-dependent evolution properties. Among all the scenarios explored, the expected number of strong lensed events detected in a 4-year observation time in LISA ranges between 0.13-231 with most of them having two (one) images detectable in the heavy (light) seed scenarios. The event numbers obtained correspond to 0.2%-0.9% of all detected unlensed events. Out of all the detectable strong-lensed events, up to 61% (in the light-seed scenario) and 1% (in the heavy-seed scenario) of them are above the detectability threshold solely due to strong lensing effects and would otherwise be undetectable. For detectable pairs of strong-lensed events by galaxy lenses, we also find between 72%-81% of them to have time delays from 1 week to 1 year.",
New submissions,Scalar-induced gravitational waves including isocurvature perturbations with lattice simulations,Xiang-Xi Zeng,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) open a unique window into early-universe physics. While their generation from adiabatic perturbations has been extensively studied, the contribution from isocurvature perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a lattice simulation framework to compute the stochastic gravitational wave background from both pure isocurvature and mixed initial conditions. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with semi-analytical predictions in the pure isocurvature case. We further analyze multi-peak structures under general initial conditions and find that they closely match those produced in purely adiabatic scenarios. Additionally, we examine SIGWs in early matter-dominated eras, revealing that the peak amplitude and spectral slope are sensitive to the microphysical properties of the dominant field, such as the primordial black hole mass, abundance, or soliton decay rate. This study establishes lattice simulations as a robust tool for predicting SIGW spectra from complex primordial perturbations, with important implications for interpreting current and future gravitational wave observations.",
New submissions,In-situ globular clusters in alternative dark matter Milky Way galaxies: a first approach to fuzzy and core-like dark matter theories,"Pierre Boldrini,Paola Di Matteo",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a first analysis of the dynamics of in-situ globular clusters (GCs) in Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies embedded in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, combining cosmological assembly histories from the TNG50 simulation with dedicated orbital integrations and analytical models. GC populations are initialized with identical distributions in normalized $E$-$L_{z}$ in matched CDM and FDM halos. In a universe dominated by FDM, we identify three distinct regimes for the in-situ GC population depending on the particle mass $m_{22} \equiv m_{\chi}/ 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$. For $m_{22} < 7$, baryons dominate the inner potential, which remains steep and centrally concentrated, confining GC orbits to a narrow region and producing less massive, more compact systems than in CDM. For $m_{22} \sim 7$, GC properties resemble those in CDM, with similar mass and spatial distributions. For $m_{22} > 7$, the dark matter becomes both compact and globally dominant, generating a deeper and more extended gravitational potential that supports a wider range of stable GC orbits, resulting in more massive and spatially extended GC systems. Finally, we extend our framework to make predictions for GC populations in alternative DM models, including warm dark matter and self-interacting dark matter, in both MW-like and dwarf galaxies. Our findings demonstrate that in-situ GC systems offer a sensitive and independent probe of the underlying DM physics, opening new avenues for observational constraints with upcoming Euclid.",
New submissions,Angular BAO Measurements with the DESI DR1 BGS Sample,"Paula S. Ferreira,Ulisses Ribeiro,Pedro da Silveira Ferreira,Clécio R. Bom,Armando Bernui",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We employ a model-independent approach in both the correlation function estimation and the angular BAO feature estimation by computing the angular two-point correlation function. First, we conducted a series of tests to the available DESI tracers to check their representativeness to angular clustering; the result was that, considering the completeness of the first data release across the footprint, we could only make use of the BGS sample for the effective redshifts 0.21 (BGS1) and 0.25 (BGS2). For a reliable analysis in such low redshift, we consider Lagrangian Perturbation Theory at first order on our mocks, which approximately reproduces the expected non-linearities, and generate the corresponding random catalogues. We use a purely statistical method to correct the projection effects and find that our results show reasonable agreement with the $\theta_{\rm BAO}$ expected by the CPL parameters obtained by DESI DR1, being BGS1 $11.78 \pm 1.12$ degrees and BGS2 $11.81 \pm 1.20$ degrees. This means a tension at the $1.5\sigma$ ($2.6\sigma$) level for BGS1 (BGS2) CPL parametrization, while a $2\sigma$ ($3.3\sigma$) discrepancy within the predicted by $\Lambda$CDM. We conclude that, with the current sample available, the use of an angular correlation function serving as the BAO probe, although prefers the CPL parametrization, does not provide conclusive results regarding the best cosmological model.",
New submissions,Measurement of Dark Matter Substructure from the Kinematics of the GD-1 Stellar Stream,"Jacob Nibauer,Ana Bonaca,Adrian M. Price-Whelan,David N. Spergel,Jenny E. Greene",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Stellar streams are sensitive tracers of low-mass dark matter subhalos and provide a means to test the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm on small scales. In this work, we connect the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the GD-1 stream to the number density and internal structure of dark matter subhalos in the mass range $10^5$-$10^9\ M_\odot$. We measure the radial velocity dispersion of GD-1 based on 160 identified member stars across four different spectroscopic catalogs. We use repeat observations of the same stars to constrain binarity. We find that the stream's intrinsic radial velocity dispersion ranges from approximately 2-5 km/s across its length. The region of GD-1 with the highest velocity dispersion represents a $4\sigma$ deviation from unperturbed stream models formed in a smooth Milky Way potential, which are substantially colder. We use perturbation theory to model the stream's velocity dispersion as a function of dark matter subhalo population parameters, including the number of low-mass subhalos in the Milky Way, the dark matter half-mode mass, and the mass-concentration relation of subhalos. We find that the observed velocity dispersion can be explained by numerous impacts with low-mass dark matter subhalos, or by a single impact with a very compact subhalo with $M \gtrsim 10^8\ M_\odot$. Our constraint on the fraction of mass in subhalos is $f_{\mathrm{sub}} = 0.05^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$ (68\% confidence). In both scenarios, our model prefers subhalos that are more compact compared to CDM mass-size expectations. These results suggest a possible deviation from CDM at low subhalo masses, which may be accounted for by dark matter self-interactions that predict higher concentrations in lower-mass subhalos.",
Cross submissions,WISPFI Experiment: Prototype Development,"Josep Maria Batllori,Dieter Horns,Marios Maroudas",High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates that couple to photons in external magnetic fields. The parameter space around $m_a \sim 50~\mu$eV remains largely unexplored by haloscope experiments. We present the first prototype of WISP Searches on a Fiber Interferometer (WISPFI), a table-top, model-independent scheme based on resonant photon-axion conversion in a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF) integrated into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). Operating near a dark fringe with active phase-locking, combined with amplitude modulation, the interferometer converts axion-induced photon disappearance into a measurable signal. A 2 W, 1550 nm laser is coupled into a 1 m-long HC-PCF placed inside a 2 T permanent magnet array, probing a fixed axion mass of $m_a \simeq 49~\mu$eV with a projected sensitivity of $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \gtrsim 1.3 \times 10^{-9}~\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for a measurement time of 30 days. Future upgrades, including pressure tuning of the effective refractive index and implementation of a Fabry-Pérot cavity, could extend the accessible mass range and improve sensitivity, establishing WISPFI as a scalable platform to explore previously inaccessible regions of the axion parameter space.",
Cross submissions,Enhanced Matter Power Spectrum from Axion Kination after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,"Raymond T. Co,Nicolas Fernandez,Akshay Ghalsasi,Keisuke Harigaya,Jessie Shelton",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Despite stringent constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, it is still possible for well-motivated particle physics models to substantially alter the cosmic expansion history between BBN and recombination. In this work we consider two different axion models that can realize a period of first matter domination, then kination, in this epoch. We perform fits to both primordial element abundances as well as CMB data and determine that up to a decade of late axion domination is allowed by these probes of the early universe. We establish the implications of late axion domination for the matter power spectrum on the scales $1/\mathrm{Mpc}\lesssim k \lesssim 10^3/$Mpc. Our 'log' model predicts a relatively modest bump-like feature together with a small suppression relative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM predictions on either side of the enhancement. Our 'two-field' model predicts a larger, plateau-like feature that realizes enhancements to the matter power spectrum of up to two orders of magnitude. These features have interesting implications for structure formation at the forefront of current detection capabilities.",
Cross submissions,Robust bounds on MACHOs from the faintest galaxies,"Peter W. Graham,Harikrishnan Ramani,Maximilian Ruhdorfer",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We use the dynamical heating of stars in ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies to set limits on Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). In our analysis we study the robustness of the bounds under uncertainties in key UFD parameters, such as the half-light radius, stellar velocity dispersion, total halo mass and dark matter and stellar density profiles. We apply this framework to both well-established UFD candidates, as well as the recently discovered UFD candidate Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. We find that multiple UFDs yield consistently strong limits in the mass range $10\, M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm MACHO} \lesssim 10^9\, M_\odot$, underscoring the robustness of a previous analysis solely based on Segue I. We also demonstrate that Ursa Major III, if confirmed as an UFD, would improve the constraints significantly, providing the strongest constraints on MACHO dark matter in the mass range $1\, M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\rm MACHO} \lesssim 10^5\, M_\odot$.",
Cross submissions,Boltzmann Suppressed Ultraviolet Freeze-in,"Nicolás Bernal,Sagnik Mukherjee,James Unwin",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"If the dark matter mass $m$ exceed the maximum temperature of the Universe ($T_{\rm max} < m$), then its production rate will be Boltzmann suppressed. The important implications of this Boltzmann suppression have been explored for dark matter freeze-in via renormalizable operators. Here we extend these considerations to the case of ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in for which freeze-in proceeds via non-renormalizable operators. The UV freeze-in variant has a number of appealing features, not least that a given effective field theory can describe a multitude of UV completions, and thus such analyses are model agnostic for a given high dimension freeze-in operator. We undertake model independent analyses of UV freeze-in for portal operators of general mass dimensions. Subsequently, we explore a number of specific examples, namely, Higgs portals, bino dark matter, and gravitino dark matter. Finally, we discuss how significant differences arise if one departs from the standard assumptions regarding inflationary reheating (i.e. transitions from an early matter dominated era to radiation domination). As a motivated example we examine the implications of early kination domination. Boltzmann suppressed UV freeze-in is well motivated and permits a number of compelling scenarios. In particular, we highlight that for $T_{\rm max} \sim$ 1 TeV it is feasible that the freeze-in mechanism is entirely realized within a couple of orders of magnitude of the TeV scale, making it experimentally accessible in contrast to traditional freeze-in scenarios.",

Reilly,Lillian Santos-Olmsted",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We analyze the effect of Dark Matter (DM) - Standard Model (SM) non-gravitational interactions on the orbital dynamics of celestial bodies near the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, where the DM density is generically expected to be high. We outline the conditions under which a DM-SM scattering channel gives rise to a drag force on objects in this region, and show that for sufficiently large cross-sections, this effect can lead to observable orbital decay on timescales as short as a single orbital period. We identify the types of objects most strongly affected by this dark drag and place constraints on specific dark matter distributions and interaction strengths, assuming both elastic and inelastic scattering. For inelastic DM, we find sensitivity to mass splittings that reach the MeV scale. We also demonstrate that a DM-induced drag force could potentially contribute to the observed depletion of red giant branch stars in the innermost region of the Milky Way.",
Cross submissions,Six-dimensional cosmological models with conformal extensions,"Daniel Muller,Sergey G. Rubin,Ilya L. Shapiro,Alexey Toporensky",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider the background cosmological solutions in the $6D$ (six-dimensional) model with one time and five space coordinates. The theory of our interest has the action composed by the Einstein term, cosmological constant, and two conformal terms constructed from the third powers of the Weyl tensor. It is shown how the highest derivative terms in the equations of motion can be isolated that opens the way for their numerical integration. There are flat anisotropic solutions which make one of the flat isotropic subspaces to be static. Depending on the value of bare cosmological constant, either two-dimensional or three-dimensional subspace can be static. In particular, there is a physically favorable solution with three ``large'' space coordinates and two extra inner dimensions stabilized. This solution is stable for a wide range of coupling constants, but this requires a special value of the bare cosmological constant.",
Cross submissions,The trichotomy of primordial black holes initial conditions,"Cristiano Germani,Laia Montellà",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We show that the threshold to form a black hole, in an asymptotically flat and radiation dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe, is not solely (mainly) determined by the behaviour of the compaction function at its maximum, as earlier thought, but also by the three-dimensional curvature at smaller (but super-horizon) scales, which we call ""the core"". We find three classes of initial conditions characterized by an open (O), closed (C), or flat (F) FRW core surrounded by a shell with higher three-dimensional curvature. In the C case, the core helps the collapse so that the black hole formation threshold is there the lowest among all cases. Type-II black holes might only be generated by Type-O or F (each of those with different thresholds, with O being the highest) or by a Type-C with an effective F core. Finally, we argue that an F core is typically more probable for a sharp power spectrum, however, it is also more likely related to non-spherical initial conditions. On the other hand, a very broad power spectrum, which might be related to the observed NanoGrav signal, would favor the formation of Type-I black holes with a mass spectrum peaked at the Infra-Red scale.",
Cross submissions,Updating GUT-Scale Pole Higgs Inflation After ACT,C. Pallis,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider models of chaotic inflation driven by the real parts of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields involved in the spontaneous breaking of a grand unification symmetry at a scale assuming its value within MSSM. We combine a superpotential, which is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R symmetry, with two fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potentials introducing two free parameters (p,N). The inflationary observables provide an excellent match to the recent ACT data for 1.355<=p<=6.7 and 6x10^-5<= N<=0.7. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and possibly detectable primordial gravitational waves with (p,N) values of order unity. A solution to the mu problem of MSSM and baryogenesis via non-thermal leptogenesis can be also accommodated extending the superpotential of the model with suitable terms.",
Cross submissions,On the uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences,"Michael Ebersold,Tania Regimbau",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.",
