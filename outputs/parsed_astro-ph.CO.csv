New submissions,JWST Discovery of Strong Lensing from a Galaxy Cluster at Cosmic Noon: Giant Arcs and a Highly Concentrated Core of XLSSC 122,"Kyle Finner,Sangjun Cha,Zachary P. Scofield,M. James Jee,Yu-heng Lin,Hyungjin Joo,Hyosun Park,Takahiro Morishita,Andreas Faisst,Bomee Lee,Wuji Wang,Ranga-Ram Chary",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),Our observations with the James Webb Space Telescope have made the remarkable discovery of strong gravitational lensing arcs from XLSSC 122 ($z=1.98$) - setting the record for the most distant galaxy cluster that exhibits strong lensing. The discovery of giant arcs enables a strong-lensing analysis and a measurement of the concentration of the dark matter halo. We perform a strong-lensing analysis of the cluster and measure the radial projected mass density profile. Our measurements reveal an exceptionally high concentration in the core of XLSSC 122. A Navarro--Frenk--White profile fit to the inner 100 kpc estimates the concentration to be $6.3\pm0.5$. The high concentration of XLSSC 122 contributes to the emerging picture that massive structure formation in the early universe may proceed more rapidly than standard models suggest. We estimate the mass within 100 kpc to be $M$($R<$100 kpc) = $6.5\pm0.7\times10^{13}$ M$_\odot$. Our mosaic images are made public atthis https URL.,
New submissions,On bursty star formation during cosmological reionization -- influence on the metal and dust content of low-mass galaxies,"Anand Menon,Sreedhar Balu,Chris Power",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Observations indicate that high-redshift galaxies undergo episodic star formation bursts, driving strong outflows that expel gas and suppress accretion. We investigate the consequences for metal and dust content of galaxies at $z\geq\!5$ using our semi-analytical model, ASHVINI. We track gas-phase and stellar metallicities $(Z_\text{g}, Z_\star)$ and dust mass $(M_{\rm d})$ in dark matter haloes spanning $M_{\rm h} = 10^6 - 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, comparing continuous and bursty star formation scenarios, which reflect underlying assumptions of instantaneous and delayed feedback, and we allow for metallicity-dependent feedback efficiency. Delayed feedback induces oscillations in $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, with $Z_{\rm g}$ declining sharply at low stellar and halo masses. This decline shifts to higher stellar and halo masses as the redshift decreases. Reionization introduces significant scatter, producing an upturn followed by rapid $Z_{\rm g}$ decline. Metallicity-dependent feedback moderates this decline at $z=7-10$, flattening the $Z_{\rm g}$-mass relation to $\simeq 0.03 - 0.04\,Z_\odot$. Dust production tracks $Z_{\rm g}$ but is sensitive to burst history, causing delayed enrichment. Our results show that burst-driven feedback decouples $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, imprints intrinsic scatter in mass-metallicity relations, and delays dust growth. These effects are strongest in low-mass halos $(M_{\rm h}\sim 10^7\,M_\odot)$, where shallow potentials amplify the impact of feedback. Our results are consistent with recent hydrodynamical and semi-analytical simulations and provides context for interpreting JWST metallicity and dust measurements, highlighting the importance of episodic star formation in early galaxy chemical evolution.",
New submissions,Evolution of linear matter perturbations with error-bounded bundle physics-informed neural networks,"Luca Gomez Bachar,Augusto T. Chantada,Susana J. Landau,Claudia G. ScÃ³ccola,Pavlos Protopapas",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We consider the evolution of linear matter perturbations in the context of the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) and a phenomenological modified gravity model. We use the physics-informed neural network (PINN) bundle method, which allows to integrate differential systems as an alternative to the traditional numerical method. We apply the PINN bundle method to the equation that describes the matter perturbation evolution, to compare its outcomes with recent data on structure growth, $f\sigma_8$. Unlike our previous works, we can calculate a bound on the error of this observable without using the numerical solution of the equation. For this, we use a method developed previously by ourselves to calculate an exact bound on the PINN-based solution using only the outcomes of the network and its residual. On the other hand, the use of an updated data set allows us to obtain more stringent constraints on the plane $\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ than previous works.",
New submissions,Oscillations and parity violation in gravitational wave background from extra tensor modes,"Jaume Garriga,Mohammad Ali Gorji,Fazlollah Hajkarim,Misao Sasaki",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Spectator fields which provide additional tensor degrees of freedom, on top of the standard metric tensor perturbations, can produce significant amounts of gravitational waves (GWs). Employing the effective field theory approach for spin-2 fields, we find a universal prediction that linear mixing between the metric and extra tensor modes inevitably induces oscillatory features in the GW spectrum, reminiscent of the so-called neutrino oscillation. Moreover, parity-violating operators in the spin-2 sector can imprint chiral signatures on the resulting GW background. We consider a concrete scenario in which the spin-2 field generates observable chiral GWs with characteristic oscillatory patterns. These results provide a model-independent characterization of the key signatures and observational implications of such scenarios which can be detected with future GW detectors.",
New submissions,SKYSURF VIII -- Modeling SKYSURF Completeness Data for Comparison to the Hubble Space Telescope Exposure Time Calculator,"Zachary Goisman(1 and 2),Timothy Carleton(1),Seth H. Cohen(1),Delondrae Carter(1),Rogier A. Windhorst(1),Rosalia O'Brien(1),Eyan Weissbluth(1) ((1) Arizona State University School of Earth and Space Exploration, (2) Arizona State University School of Electrical and Computer Engineering)",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Accurately assessing image source completeness is critical for interpreting measurements on telescope data. Using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) data from the Hubble Space Telescope ($HST$) archival project ""SKYSURF"", we model galaxy completeness as a function of the exposure time and background of an image. This is accomplished by adding simulated objects with varying magnitudes and sizes into these images, and determining the detection rate for each set of parameters. The fifty percent completeness results are then compared to the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC), in order to assess the differences between the STSCI ETC and our analysis of the archival data. Ultimately, we find that, for extended galaxies, the ETC predicts a 1-2 magnitudes fainter completeness limit than our data. We believe the difference is due to the ETC's flat surface brightness profiles being less accurate at predicting for extended sources compared to our more realistic profiles.",
New submissions,Particle physics models of interacting bosonic dark energy and fermionic dark matter in Einstein scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity,"Simran Arora,Saddam Hussain,Benjamin Rose,Anzhong Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore a cosmological framework in which a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field, acting as dark energy, interacts with a fermionic dark matter field through a coupling obtained from the point of view of particle physics. This setup is inspired by string/M-theory, and two representative scalar field potentials are investigated: exponential and power-law. A distinctive feature of the GB-coupled models is their potential to alter the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs), a property with significant implications in light of recent multi-messenger astrophysical observations. To account for this, we analyze models under two scenarios: one where the GW speed differs from that of light and the other where they are equal, but all consistent with current observational constraints. The dynamical evolution of the system is investigated by reformulating the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system, enabling a detailed analysis of the Universe's long-term behavior, including the radiation-, matter- and dark energy-dominated epochs. We constrain the model parameters using a broad set of recent observational data, including mock high-redshift measurements from the Roman Space Telescope. Our findings indicate that both potentials yield cosmologies that are in excellent agreement with current data, closely tracking the expansion history predicted by the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model, while still allowing room for subtle deviations that could be tested by future observations.",
New submissions,"Halo Occupation Distribution of Quasars: Dependence on Luminosity, Redshift, Black Hole Mass and Feedback Modes","Anirban Chowdhary,Suchetana Chatterjee",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\sim 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function. We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias ({\bf a factor of $\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\sim 10-70\%$ in the satellite occupation fraction}) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \%$ of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.",
New submissions,Constraints on the varying electron mass and early dark energy in light of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 and the implications for inflation,"Yo Toda,Osamu Seto",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Primarily motivated by the Hubble tension, we analyze the varying electron mass model and axionlike early dark energy model (EDE) using baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2 data and including the recent results from ACT DR6. Our analysis indicates that $m_{e} / m_{e0} = 1.0081 \pm 0.0046 $ and the energy fraction of EDE is constrained as $f_\mathrm{EDE} < 0.016$. Since those cosmological models fit with different spectral index $n_s$, we show the posterior of those models on the ($n_s-r$) plane and point out that, for example, Starobinsky inflation works for varying electron mass model while the standard supersymmetric hybrid inflation is preferred in the EDE model.",
New submissions,Study of the Connected Four-Point Correlation Function of Galaxies from DESI Data Release 1 Luminous Red Galaxy Sample,"J. Hou,R. N. Cahn,J. Aguilar,S. Ahlen,D. Bianchi,D. Brooks,T. Claybaugh,P. Doel,S. Ferraro,J. E. Forero-Romero,E. GaztaÃ±aga,L. Le Guillou,G. Gutierrez,K. Honscheid,D. Huterer,M. Ishak,R. Joyce,S. Juneau,R. Kehoe,D. Kirkby,T. Kisner,A. Kremin,C. Lamman,M.

Silber,Z. Slepian,D. Sprayberry,G. TarlÃ©,B. A. Weaver,H. Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a measurement of the non-Gaussian four-point correlation function (4PCF) from the DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. For the gravitationally induced parity-even 4PCF, we detect a signal with a significance of 14.7$\sigma$ using our fiducial setup. We assess the robustness of this detection through a series of validation tests, including auto- and cross-correlation analyses, sky partitioning across multiple patch combinations, and variations in radial scale cuts. Due to the low completeness of the sample, we find that differences in fiber assignment implementation schemes can significantly impact estimation of the covariance and introduce biases in the data vector. After correcting for these effects, all tests yield consistent results. This is one of the first measurements of the connected 4PCF on the DESI LRG sample: the good agreement between the simulation and the data implies that the amplitude of the density fluctuation inferred from the connected 4PCF is consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The methodology and diagnostic framework established in this work provide a foundation for interpreting parity-odd 4PCF.",
New submissions,Tracing Large Scale Structure Morphology with Multiwavelength Line Intensity Maps,"Manas Mohit Dosibhatla,Suman Majumdar,Chandra Shekhar Murmu,Samit Kumar Pal,Saswata Dasgupta,Satadru Bag",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the large scale structure (LSS) in the post-reionisation era. This captures the integrated flux of a particular spectral line emission from multiple sources within a patch of the sky without resolving them. Mapping different galaxy line emissions, such as the HI $21$-cm and CO rotational lines via LIM, can reveal complementary information about the bias with which the line emitters trace the underlying matter distribution and how different astrophysical phenomena affect the clustering pattern of these signals. The stage where the structures in the cosmic web merge to form a single connected structure is known as the percolation transition. Using mock HI $21$-cm and CO($1-0$) LIM signals in the post-reionisation universe, we explore the connectivity of structures through percolation analysis and compare it with that of the underlying galaxy distribution. We probe the relative contributions of voids, filaments, and sheets to the galaxy density and line intensity maps using a morphological measure known as the local dimension. The CO($1-0$) map exhibits an increased filamentary behaviour and larger contribution from sheets than the $21$-cm map. We attempt to explain such an emission of the CO($1-0$) line from biased environments. The upcoming SKA-Mid will produce tomographic intensity maps of the $21$-cm signal at $z \lesssim 3$ in Band-1. CO maps can be produced at these redshifts in phase 2 of SKA-Mid, where the frequency coverage is expected to increase up to $\sim 50$ GHz. We present forecasts for the recovery of the local dimensions of these intensity maps contaminated by instrumental noise, considering SKA-Mid observations.",
New submissions,Measurement of Parity-Violating Modes of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 Luminous Red Galaxies' 4-Point Correlation Function,"Zachary Slepian,Alex Krolewski,Alessandro Greco,Simon May,William Ortola Leonard,Farshad Kamalinejad,Jessica Chellino,Matthew Reinhard,Elena Fernandez,Francisco Prada,Steven Ahlen,Davide Bianchi,David Brooks,Todd Claybaugh,Axel de la Macorra,Arnaud de Mattia,Biprateep Dey,Peter Doel,Enrique Gaztanaga,Gaston Gutierrez,Klaus Honscheid,Dragan Huterer,Dick Joyce,Robert Kehoe,David Kirkby,Theodore Kisner,Martin Landriau,Laurent Le Guillou,Marc Manera,Aaron Meisner,Ramon Miquel,Seshadri Nadathur,Will Percival,Ashley Ross,Eusebio Sanchez,David Schlegel,Michael Schubnell,Hee-Jong Seo,Joseph Silber,David Sprayberry,Gregory Tarle",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Here we report the first measurement of the parity-violating (PV) 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's Year 1 Luminous Red Galaxy (DESI Y1 LRG) sample, motivated by the potential detection of the PV 4PCF in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS BOSS) galaxies. In our auto-correlation (""auto"") analysis, we find a statistically significant excess of the PV signal compared to mocks without any PV, at 4-10$\sigma$ depending on details of the analysis. This could arise either from genuine PV or from an underestimation of the variance in the mocks; it is unlikely to arise, at the signal level, from a systematic. We then cross-correlate (""cross"") the putative PV signal between different, independent patches of sky, and there find no detection of parity violation. The two measurements are in significant tension: while the cross has somewhat larger error bars than the auto, this is not sufficient to explain the discrepancy. We thus present the current work as an intriguing addition to the PV work on BOSS and as motivation for exploring further the relationship between the auto and cross PV 4PCF analyses.",
Cross submissions,Super-heated first order phase transitions,"Giulio Barni,Andrea Tesi",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study first order phase transitions that occur when the temperature of the system increases and we identify the conditions that lead to super-heating, a phase where the system can heat up arbitrarily. First order phase transitions with super-heating behave as inverse transitions. We quantify these claims by studying a prototypical example of a dark sector with a large number of interacting light bosons at finite temperature. Depending upon thermalisation, a super-heated phase transition in cosmology is often associated with another transition when the system is eventually cooling down, enriching the spectrum of gravitational waves from bubble collisions.",
Cross submissions,Precision calculation of $N_{\text{eff}}$ with Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo,"Oleksii Ihnatenko,Maksym Ovchynnikov",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach ($\nu$DSMC) is a method of solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation in the Early Universe, proposed to study the evolution of neutrinos under various cosmological setups. We formulate a complete $\nu$DSMC solver, incorporating the effects of the electron mass, neutrino oscillations, and quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of the electromagnetic plasma. We then apply it for performing precise calculations of neutrino decoupling in the standard cosmological scenario. We obtain the value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.0439\pm 0.0006$, in agreement with the state-of-the-art calculations.",
Cross submissions,WIMP Dark Matter within the dark photon portal,"X. G. Wang,B. M. Loizos,A. W. Thomas",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),We test the dark photon as a portal connecting to the dark sector in the case of Dirac fermion and complex scalar dark matter with masses up to 1 TeV. Both the dark photon and the $Z$ boson contribute to the dark matter annihilation and dark matter--nucleon scattering processes. We derive the lower limits on the dark parameters from thermal relic density. The corresponding spin-independent dark matter--proton cross sections are compared with the upper bounds set by direct detection. We explore the allowed regions of the dark parameter space that are consistent with these constraints.,
Cross submissions,On quantum creation of a toroidal universe,"Alan H. Guth,Alexander Vilenkin",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider the quantum creation of a universe with flat spatial sections and the topology of a 3-torus, taking into account the effect of Casimir energy. We show that the corresponding instantons are singular. Since these instantons describe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that they cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum corrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the toroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic identifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime is geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical universe originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude that the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be described in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either impossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics. We therefore see no reasonable way to compare the probability of creation of a toroidal universe, if it is possible at all, with that of a spherical universe.",
Cross submissions,Inflation in $F(R)$ gravity models revisited after ACT,"Sergei V. Ketov,Ekaterina O. Pozdeeva,Sergey Yu. Vernov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The $F(R)$ gravity models of inflation are revisited in light of the recent observations of cosmic microwave background radiation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and DESI Collaboration. A detailed study of the evolution equations in the Jordan frame is given and a new description of the slow-roll approximation in the $F(R)$-gravity-based models of inflation is proposed. It is found that all those models of inflation are significantly constrained by demanding a higher (than the Planck Telescope value) cosmological tilt $n_s$ of scalar perturbations and a positive running index $\alpha_s$ favored by ACT. It is not difficult to meet the ACT constraints on the scalar tilt $n_s$ by modifying the existing models of inflation, but simultaneously demanding a positive running $\alpha_s$ would rule out many of them. Using the proposed slow-roll approximation in the Jordan frame, we provide a new modification of the Starobinsky inflation model in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity, which satisfies all ACT constraints.",
