New submissions,Kinetically Coupled Dark Matter Condensates,"Michael W. Toomey,Savvas M. Koushiappas,Stephon Alexander",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Dark matter consisting of ultralight bosons can form a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate with distinctive observational signatures. While this possibility has been extensively studied for axions and axion-like particles $-$ pseudoscalars with masses protected by shift symmetry $-$ realistic models from string theory and other higher-dimensional theories predict more complex structures. Here we investigate a two-field generalization where an axion couples to a moduli field through its kinetic term, representing the phase and radial modes of a complex scalar field. We demonstrate that when this system forms a gravitationally bound Bose-Einstein condensate, the kinetic coupling produces dramatic modifications to cosmological evolution compared to the canonical single-field case. Most notably, the axion Jeans scale becomes dynamically dependent on the moduli field's evolution, fundamentally altering structure formation. By mapping existing observational constraints from canonical axion models to our two-field scenario, we identify regions of parameter space that are already excluded by current observations. In particular, consistency with observations requires that the moduli field must take on small field values, $\chi/M_{\rm pl} \ll 1$, throughout most of cosmic history for this class of axions to remain a viable description of all dark matter.",
New submissions,Scale-dependent bias and mode coupling in redshift-space clustering near the BAO scale,"Aseem Paranjape(IUCAA),Ravi K. Sheth(UPenn/ICTP)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the 2-point clustering of biased tracers in redshift space can be described in a model-agnostic manner, relying only on the assumption that nonlinear growth approximately smears this feature with a Gaussian kernel sourced by gravitationally driven bulk flows as in the Zel'dovich approximation. An explicit model that demonstrated this in recent work did not account for two physical effects that are very likely observationally relevant in the context of ongoing surveys, namely, the scale-dependence of linear Lagrangian density and velocity bias and the effects of mode coupling. We rectify this shortcoming in this paper by showing that a simple model including these effects is able to accurately describe the multipoles of the 2pcf of realistic tracer samples at BAO scales. Our results indicate that the effects of scale-dependent bias will be important to model for surveys such as DESI, while those of mode coupling are relatively less significant. Our model for scale-dependent bias and mode coupling, which is motivated by model-agnostic arguments from peaks theory and the Zel'dovich approximation, lies in the class of `Laplace-Gauss' expansions, making it straightforward to incorporate these effects in the model-agnostic inference framework mentioned above.",
New submissions,"Large, fast and accurate HI intensity maps with latent overlap diffusion","Satvik Mishra,Roberto Trotta,Matteo Viel",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The distribution of 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen is a powerful cosmological and astrophysical probe, as it traces the underlying dark matter and cold gas distributions throughout cosmic times. However, the prediction of observable signals is hindered by the large computational costs of the required hydrodynamic simulations. We introduce a novel machine learning pipeline that, once trained on a hydrodynamical simulation, is able to generate both halo mass density maps and the three-dimensional 21 cm brightness temperature signal, starting from a dark matter-only simulation. We use an attention-based ResUNet (HALO) to predict dark matter halo maps, which are then processed through a trained conditional variational diffusion model (LODI) to produce 21 cm brightness temperature maps. LODI is trained on smaller sub-volumes that are then seamlessly combined in 512-times larger volume using a new method, called `latent overlap'. We demonstrate that, once trained on 25^3 (Mpc/h)^3 volume simulations, we are able to predict the 21 cm power spectrum on an unseen dark matter map (with the same cosmology) to within 10% for wavenumbers k <= 10 h Mpc^-1, deep inside the non-linear regime, with a computational effort of the order of two minutes. While demonstrated on this specific volume, our approach is designed to be scalable to arbitrarily large simulations.",
New submissions,The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST,"Pratika Dayal,Roberto maiolino",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of $z \sim 10.4$. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by $z \sim 10$ and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.1$. These pose a serious challenge for ""astrophysical"" seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with ``cosmological"" primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between $10^{0.5}-10^6 M_\odot$. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between $10^{1.25-11.25} ~(10^{0.75-7.25})M_\odot$ at $z \sim 5 (15)$ for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin $s=0$ or $-1$) naturally result in extremely high values of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.25$ at $z \sim 5-15$. For a typical stellar mass of $M_* =10^9 M_\odot$, we find an average value of $M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim 0.4~ (1.6)$ for $s=0~(-1)$ at $z=5$, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor ($Z \leq 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction $\leq 10^{-9}$ and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.",
New submissions,Integrated Galaxy Light from Stacking $10^5$ Random Pointings in the Dark Energy Survey Data,"Jenna E. Moore,Seth H. Cohen,Philip Mauskopf,Evan Scannapieco",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a new technique for measuring the integrated galaxy light (IGL) with stacked image data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We extract $1\times1$ arcminute cutouts from nearly 100,000 randomly selected positions in the g, r, i, z, and Y bands from the DES data release 2 (DR2) maps. We generate source catalogs and masks for each cutout and the images are subsequently stacked to generate deep images of the sky both with and without sources. The IGL is then calculated by taking the difference in average brightness between stacks that contain galaxies and stacks in which galaxies have been masked. We find IGL values of $g = 4.27 \pm 0.28, r = 6.97 \pm 0.42, i = 8.66 \pm 0.53, z = 10.16 \pm 0.7,$ and $Y = 13.78 \pm 2.35$ nW/m$^2$/sr. These measurements, which require no foreground estimation or removal, are in agreement with previously reported IGL values derived from galaxy number counts and other methods. This stacking technique reduces the sensitivity to diffuse local backgrounds but is not sensitive to large-scale diffuse extragalactic background light.",
New submissions,Unified reconstruction of the Lyman-alpha power spectrum with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,"N. G. Karaçaylı,P. L. Taylor",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The complex geometry of the Ly$\alpha$ forest data has motivated the use of various two-point statistics as alternatives to the three-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{3D}}$), which carries cosmological information in Fourier space. On large scales, the three-dimensional correlation function ($\xi_\mathrm{3D}$) has provided robust measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at 150 Mpc. On smaller scales, the one-dimensional power spectrum, $P_{\mathrm{1D}}(k_\|)$, has been the primary tool for extracting information. At the same time, the cross-spectrum, $P_\times(\theta, k_\|)$, has been introduced to incorporate angular information without the complications caused by survey window functions. We propose an analytical forward-modeling framework to reconstruct $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ from all these observables in a nearly model-independent way. We demonstrate the performance of our method using a hypothetical mock data vector representative of future Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements and show that the monopole of $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ can be reconstructed in 25 $k$ bins between $0.07~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $1.8~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, achieving a median precision of $8\%$ and a mean precision of $13\%$. Our method can serve as an intermediary for consistency checks, though it is not intended to replace direct $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ estimation.",
New submissions,A cosmology weakly dependent measurement of 2D Baryon Acoustic Oscillations scale from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey,"U. Ribeiro,F. Avila,C. R. Bom,C. Franco,A. Cortesi,C. Mendes de Oliveira,A. Kanaan,T. Ribeiro,W. Schoenell,E. Telles,A. Bernui",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) provide a robust standard ruler for observational cosmology, enabling precise constraints on the expansion history of the Universe. We present a weakly model-dependent measurement of the BAO angular scale in the low-redshift Universe using the blue galaxies from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). Our analysis is based on the 2-point angular correlation function applied to a selected photometric sample of $5977$ galaxies with redshifts $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.1$. To account for photometric redshift uncertainties, we implement a resampling technique using the probability distribution function of each galaxy. Angular correlations are computed using the Landy-Szalay estimator; the uncertainties are quantified using a set of $1000$ log-normal mock catalogues. Our 2-point angular correlation analyses reveal a prominent BAO signal that after a shift correction, due to the projection effect caused by the finite thickness of the redshift bin, provides the transversal BAO measurement: $\theta_{BAO} = 21.81^{\circ} \pm 0.85^{\circ}$, at $z_{eff} = 0.075$, detected with a statistical significance of $3.22 \sigma$. In addition, we performed consistency tests that support the robustness of our result. Our measurement constitutes the first robust detection of the transversal BAO scale: at the lowest-redshift in the Universe and using multi-band (narrow+wide) photometry data from the S-PLUS.",

The enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP), planned to be launched in 2030, has several key advantages, including advanced polarimetry, high sensitivity & large effective area, and wide energy range coverage, which make it a groundbreaking project in high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave (GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and TeV active galactic nucleus (AGNs), and so on. We discuss the advantages of future eXTP observations for detecting these sources, their detection capabilities, the abilities to distinguish theoretical models, and their applications in gravity and cosmology.",
New submissions,Discovery of Odd Radio Circles and Other Peculiars in the First Year of the EMU Survey using Object Detection,"Nikhel Gupta,Ray P. Norris,Zeeshan Hayder,Minh Huynh,Heinz Andernach,Andrew M. Hopkins,Stanislav Shabala,Lawrence Rudnick,Miroslav D. Filipović,Bärbel S. Koribalski,Lars Petersson,X. Rosalind Wang",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a systematic search for Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) and other unusual radio morphologies using data from the first year of the EMU (Evolutionary Map of the Universe) survey. ORCs are rare, enigmatic objects characterized by edge-brightened rings of radio emission, often found in association with distant galaxies. To identify these objects, we employ a hybrid methodology combining supervised object detection techniques and visual inspection of radio source candidates. This approach leads to the discovery of five new ORCs and two additional candidate ORCs, expanding the known population of these objects. In addition to ORCs, we also identify 55 Galaxies with Large-scale Ambient Radio Emission (GLAREs), which feature irregular, rectangular, or circular shapes of diffuse radio emission mostly surrounding central host galaxies. These GLAREs may represent different evolutionary stages of ORCs, and studying them could offer valuable insights into their evolutionary processes. We also highlight a subset of Starburst Radio Ring Galaxies (SRRGs), which are star-forming galaxies exhibiting edge-brightened radio rings surrounding their central star-forming regions. We emphasize the importance of multi-wavelength follow-up observations to better understand the physical properties, host galaxy characteristics, and evolutionary pathways of these radio sources.",
New submissions,Behaviour of $α$-attractors in Warm Inflation,"Dibya Chakraborty,Suratna Das",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation have remained one of the preferred inflationary models for nearly a decade now. The unique attractor nature of these models in the $n_s-r$ plane have put these models in the sweet-spot of the $n_s-r$ measurement of Planck observations. In this article, we analyse the behaviour of such attractor models in a Warm Inflation setup to investigate whether the attractor nature of these models can be retained even when the dynamics deviates from the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. We have chosen to analyse these models in a strongly dissipative Warm inflation setup, namely the Minimal Warm Inflation, as in such a setup the inflationary dynamics significantly departs from the standard Cold inflation dynamics. We observe that the departure from the standard Cold inflation dynamics destroys the unique attractor nature of such models. The analysis clearly indicates that the attractor nature of these $\alpha$-attractor models is quite unique to the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. However, on a positive note, the analysis indicates that the $\alpha$-attractor models may be made in tune with the recent ACT results in Warm inflation for certain parameter ranges.",
New submissions,Catalog of very-high-energy emitting active galactic nuclei at high Galactic latitudes,"A.Neronov,D.Semikoz",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Large number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) producing Very-High-Energy (VHE) gamma-rays (energies above 100~GeV) has been revealed using observations with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). However, our knowledge of the VHE emitting AGN population is limited in the absence of an unbiased sky survey. We use long exposure of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to perform a survey of VHE emitting AGN at Galactic latitudes |b|>10 degrees. We consider clustering of gamma-ray events with energies E>100 GeV around positions of AGN from the 4-th LAT source catalog to select sources detected in the VHE range. The VHE AGN catalog produced in this way contains overall 175 sources detected with high confidence and additional 100 sources detected at more than 3-sigma level. It is 90% complete at the flux limit 1.3e-12 erg/cm2s. Less than half of the source sample (71) are previously reported VHE emitters, other sources are new detections in the VHE band. The majority of VHE AGN detectable at the survey flux limit are BL Lac type objects. We find their luminosity function to derive their spatial density (6.5+/-0.5)e-7/ Mpc3 and the characteristic luminosity scale ~1e44 erg/s. Ten sources in the VHE AGN catalog are nearby radio galaxies and seven are flat spectrum radio quasars, while 20 sources are unclassified AGN. We also include in our catalog four unidentified sources that may or may not be VHE AGN. 63 source in the catalog are ""extreme"" blazars, with 41 of them being new VHE band detections. In spite of the fact that the VHE flux is heavily attenuated by the pair production in interactions with Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), the catalog includes 7 sources at redshift larger than 1. Some of these sources show peculiar hardening of the VHE band spectra that point either to errors in redshift determination, or to limitations of modeling of cosmological evolution of EBL.",

New submissions,syren-baryon: Analytic emulators for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum,"Lukas Kammerer,Deaglan J. Bartlett,Gabriel Kronberger,Harry Desmond,Pedro G. Ferreira",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE),"Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys, acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.",
New submissions,Testing scalar dark matter clumps with Pulsar Timing Arrays,"Philippe Brax,Patrick Valageas",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Scalar dark matter is a viable alternative to particle dark matter models such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS). This is particularly the case for scalars with a low mass $m \gtrsim 10^{-21} {\rm eV}$ as required to make quantum effects macroscopic on galactic scales. We point out that by synchronising the measurements of arrival times of pairs of pulsars, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) could probe ultralight dark matter (ULDM) scenarios with a mass $10^{-23} {\rm eV}\lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-19} {\rm eV}$ that is greater than the one reached in standard analysis. The upper limit on the mass $m$ is set by the time lag $\Delta t$ between the observations of the two pulsars and could be pushed above $10^{-19} {\rm eV}$ for $\Delta t$ smaller than one hour.",
New submissions,Evidence for a sign change of the ISW effect in the very recent universe: hot voids and cold overdensities at $z<0.03$,"Frode K. Hansen,Diego Garcia Lambas,Andrés N. Ruiz,Facundo Toscano,Luis A. Pereyra",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We find that CMB photons passing through local voids ($z<0.03$) are hotter than expected at the $2.7-3.6\sigma$ level. Combined with earlier findings showing a $>5\sigma$ cooling of CMB photons in galactic filaments in the same redshift range, we now have possible evidence for a negative Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in the very recent universe. In addition to having opposite sign, the observed amplitude is an order of magnitude larger than the predicted Rees-Sciama and ISW effects for the nearby universe. An altered growth of gravitational potentials at very low redshift, as predicted by some dark energy and modified gravity models, could give rise to the observed sign change. We discuss the results in light of the latest Data Release 2 results of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) showing evidence for dynamical dark energy. When removing the CMB quadrupole, we find the temperatures measured in voids to a large degree uncorrelated with the temperature measured in galaxies and the observed mean difference of $41\mu$K between void and galaxy temperatures is about $6.5\sigma$ larger than found in simulations.",
New submissions,Cosmic filaments confirm unexplained cooling of CMB photons in two independent redshift ranges,"Juan Ignacio Domínguez Feldman,Luis A. Pereyra,Frode K. Hansen,Facundo Toscano,Diego Garcia Lambas",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent papers have reported an unexplained cooling of CMB photons passing through galaxies in nearby cosmic filaments $z<0.02$ at the $>5\sigma$ level. Here we show for the first time that this effect is also present at higher redshifts $0.02<z<0.04$. Instead of calculating the CMB temperature around individual galaxies as in previous works, we analyze mean CMB temperature profiles associated to cosmic filaments in three dimensions. We have considered different thresholds in the linear K-band luminosity density of the filaments as a proxy to mass density. Furthermore, we have analyzed the dependence of the results on the average orientation of filaments with respect to the line of sight. These studies were implemented to test the expected dependence on mass density as well as on photon trajectory length within the cosmic filaments. We find a $3-4\sigma$ detection of a temperature decrement trend towards the spine of the filaments, the larger the mass and the more radially oriented the filament, the stronger the temperature decrement. This trend is seen independently in both redshift ranges $0.004<z<0.02$ and $0.02<z<0.04$. We therefore conclude that our results provide strong evidence for a lower CMB temperature along massive cosmic filaments in the nearby universe $z<0.04$.",

Wollack",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Diffuse, low surface-brightness radio emission in merging galaxy clusters provides insights into cosmic structure formation, the growth of magnetic fields, and turbulence. This paper reports a search for diffuse radio emission in a pilot sample of six high-redshift ($1.01 < z < 1.31$) galaxy clusters from the MeerKAT Massive Distant Cluster Survey (MMDCS). These six clusters are selected as the most massive $(M_{\rm 500c} = 6.7\,- 8.5 \times 10^{14}~\rm{M_{\odot}})$ systems based on their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich mass from the full MMDCS sample of 30 ACT DR5 clusters, and were observed first to explore the high-mass, high-redshift regime. Diffuse radio emission is confidently detected in four clusters and tentatively identified in two, with $k$-corrected radio powers scaled to 1.4 GHz ranging from $(0.46 \pm 0.16)$ to $(4.51 \pm 1.68) \times 10^{24}\, \mathrm{WHz^{-1}}$ and linear sizes between 0.47 and 1.08 Mpc. Combining $Chandra$ X-ray data with MeerKAT radio data, we find that 80$\%$ of clusters with X-ray observations exhibit disturbed morphologies indicative of mergers. These $z > 1$ galaxy clusters scatter around the established radio power-mass scaling relation observed at lower redshifts, supporting turbulent re-acceleration models in high-redshift mergers. However, their radio spectra are predicted to steepen ($\alpha < -1.5$) due to enhanced inverse Compton losses in the cosmic microwave background, rendering them under-luminous at 1.4 GHz and placing them below the correlation. Our results demonstrate that merger-driven turbulence can sustain radio halos even at $z > 1$ while highlighting MeerKAT's unique ability to probe non-thermal processes in the early universe.",

This cross-correlation signal measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16.41 allows us to infer a 3D number density profile which shows a significant steepening at the edges of these galaxy clusters, namely the splashback radius of $r_{sp}$ /$h^{-1} \mathrm{M_{\odot}} = 2.19^{+0.50}_{-0.43}$. We present the dependence of the splashback radius value over a range of absolute galaxy magnitude cuts to look for any evidence of dynamical friction affecting these results. The weak lensing signal around our galaxy clusters measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of 32.19 allows us to infer a halo mass $\text{log} (M_{\rm 200m} / h^{-1} \text{Mpc}) = 14.68_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$.

Cosmological models are constrained with GRBs at high-redshift and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical approach. For the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model within a flat universe, we obtain \(\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.321^{+0.078}_{-0.069}\), \(h = 0.654^{+0.053}_{-0.071}\), \(w_0 = -1.02^{+0.67}_{-0.50}\), and \(w_a = -0.98^{+0.58}_{-0.58}\) at the 1-\(\sigma\) confidence level, which indicating a preference for dark energy with potential redshift evolution (\(w_a \neq 0\)).

By cross-correlating the dispersion of background FRBs with the locations of foreground galaxies, we can study the relative spatial distributions of plasma and galaxies on scales of 0.1 to 50 Mpc, which are strongly affected by feedback processes in galaxy formation. Here we present the measurement of the dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy angular cross-power spectrum between 2873 FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog and nearly 6 million galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Over five photometric galaxy redshift bins spanning $0.05 < z <0.5$ and at 5.1$\sigma$ significance, we make the first definitive detection of spatial correlations in FRB dispersion measure due to cosmic structure. While parameter inferences should be interpreted with caution because of incomplete modelling of both the signal and systematic errors, our data indicate that the plasma$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy cross-power spectrum cuts off relative to the matter power spectrum at a scale $k_\textrm{cut}^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\,\textrm{Mpc}$. This scale is consistent with those X-ray stacking analyses that suggest dark-matter halos with group-scale masses are largely evacuated of their baryons by feedback processes.

These foregrounds can introduce mode coupling at small-scales (multipoles $\ell \geq 3000$) that mimic true lensing signals, thereby complicating analyses such as CMB lensing reconstruction. We present a novel approach to learn their full joint distribution using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained on paired CIB-tSZ patches at 150 GHz, from the Agora suite of extragalactic sky simulations. While simulations like Agora, which are based on N-body calculations, can take thousands of CPU hours, DDPM can synthesize realistic CIB-tSZ patches that faithfully reproduce both auto- and cross-spectral statistics of the 2-point, 3-point, and 4-point correlation functions, in a matter of seconds. We further demonstrate matching pixel-value histograms and Minkowski functionals, confirming that conventional non-Gaussian benchmarks are also satisfied. This framework provides a powerful generative tool for forward-modeling correlated extragalactic foregrounds in current and future CMB analyses. Although we mainly demonstrate the joint modeling of tSZ and CIB at a single frequency, we also include examples of its extension to multiple frequencies, showing that the framework can learn the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) across different bands. While establishing DDPMs as a promising tool for addressing foreground contamination in next-generation CMB surveys, we also outline remaining challenges to their practical deployment in analysis pipelines, such as scaling to larger sky areas and reliance on the underlying cosmological and astrophysical assumptions in the simulations used for training.",
Cross submissions,Perturbative Kähler Moduli Inflation,"Mishaal Hai,Ahmed Rakin Kamal,Noshin Ferdous Shamma,Md Shaikot Jahan Shuvo",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this work, we present two classes of inflationary models in the framework of type IIB string theory. The inflatons correspond to blow-up Kähler modulus arising from compactifying type IIB on a Calabi-Yau. Using perturbative corrections, we first highlight a procedure for stabilising more than one Kähler modulus. For the case of two Kähler moduli, we explicitly construct two class of inflationary potentials within the Kähler cone which satisfy both EFT and cosmological constraints. The first class of models, arising from moduli redefinition of the blow-up mode, have a potential of the form $V(\phi)=V_0(1+C_1 \phi^{2/3})$ align with CMB data with scalar-to-tensor ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-2}$. The second class of models, which have been recently proposed in the name of loop blow-up inflation, have a form $V(\phi)=V_0(1+C_2\phi^{-2/3})$ also agrees with CMB data with scalar-to tensor-ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-8}$.",
Cross submissions,Discovering the Higgsino at CTAO-North within the Decade,"Shotaro Abe,Tomohiro Inada,Emmanuel Moulin,Nicholas L. Rodd,Benjamin R. Safdi,Weishuang Linda Xu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We demonstrate that higgsino dark matter (DM) could be discovered within the next few years using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory's soon-to-be-operational northern site (CTAO-North). A 1.1 TeV thermal higgsino is a highly motivated yet untested model of DM. Despite its strong theoretical motivation in supersymmetry and beyond, the higgsino is notoriously difficult to detect; it lies deep within the neutrino fog of direct detection experiments and could pose a challenge even for a future muon collider. We show that, in contrast, higgsino detection could be possible within this decade with CTAO-North in La Palma, Spain. The Galactic Center is the region where the dominant DM annihilation signature emerges, but it only barely rises above the horizon at the CTAO-North site. However, we project that this challenge can be overcome with large-zenith-angle observations at the northern site, enabling the conclusive detection of a higgsino signal by 2030 for a range of DM density profiles in the inner Galaxy.",
Cross submissions,Impostor Among $ν$s: Dark Radiation Masquerading as Self-Interacting Neutrinos,"Anirban Das,P. S. Bhupal Dev,Christina Gao,Subhajit Ghosh,Taegyun Kim",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Multiple cosmological observations hint at neutrino self-interactions beyond the Standard Model, yet such interactions face severe constraints from terrestrial experiments. We resolve this tension by introducing a model where active neutrinos resonantly convert to self-interacting dark radiation after BBN but before CMB epoch. This exploits the fact that cosmological observables cannot distinguish between neutrinos and dark radiation with the same abundance and free-streaming properties. Our mechanism, based on a simple Type-I seesaw framework along with a keV-scale scalar mediator, achieves two objectives: (1) it produces strongly self-interacting dark radiation that imitates neutrino self-interactions favored by cosmological data, and (2) it depletes the active neutrino energy density, relaxing cosmological neutrino mass bounds and easing the tension with neutrino oscillation data. The model naturally evades laboratory constraints through suppression of the neutrino-mediator coupling by the squared mass ratio of active and sterile neutrinos. We demonstrate how this scenario is favored over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined Planck and DESI data, while being consistent with all other constraints. Our mechanism is testable in future laboratory probes of absolute neutrino mass and searches for sterile neutrinos.",
Cross submissions,GW170817 Viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation Compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data,"S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we investigate several Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models that are compatible with the GW170817 event, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the BICEP/Keck updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We consider two distinct classes of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories, which are equally successful for GW170817-compatible model building and we examine their viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The two models are distinct since the first class relates directly the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function with the scalar potential and yields $c_T^2=1$ while in the second class, the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function and the scalar potential are freely but conveniently chosen and the class of models respects the constraint $\left| c_T^2 - 1 \right| < 6 \times 10^{-15}$. We provide several examples of models belonging to both the two classes of GW170817-compatible Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories and we demonstrate that Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories provide a promising theoretical framework for inflationary dynamics.",
Cross submissions,The Highest-Energy Neutrino Event Constrains Dark Matter-Neutrino Interactions,"Toni Bertólez-Martínez,Gonzalo Herrera,Pablo Martínez-Miravé,Jorge Terol Calvo",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Dark Matter-neutrino interactions affect the propagation of astrophysical neutrinos, attenuating the flux of neutrinos arriving at Earth. Using the highest-energy neutrino event detected to date by the KM3NeT collaboration as an example, and assuming an extragalactic origin, we derive limits on these interactions at $E_\nu = 220^{+570}_{-110}\, \mathrm{PeV}$. Considering only the propagation on the Milky Way Dark Matter halo, we constrain the interaction cross section over the mass of the Dark Matter candidate to be, $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 10^{-22}$~cm$^2$~GeV$^{-1}$. If a transient source was positively identified, the high-energy neutrino would have crossed the dark-matter halo of the source host as well, resulting in more stringent constraints (e.g., up to $ \sim$ 6 orders of magnitude assuming the blazar PKS 0605-085 is the source). These bounds on the Dark Matter-neutrino interaction cross section are translated into limits on the mass of the Dark Matter candidate, the mass of the mediator, and the coupling strength for different simplified models. In particular, we find that the KM3-230213A high-energy event sets the most stringent constraints on models where the scattering cross section rises in the high-energy limit. We identify vector Dark Matter interacting with neutrinos via vector mediators as the most promising scenario, and show that high-energy neutrinos provide world-leading limits in this model, testing the region of parameter space motivated by thermal freeze-out.",
