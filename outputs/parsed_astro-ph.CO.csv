New submissions,CLAPP: The CLASS LLM Agent for Pair Programming,"Santiago Casas,Christian Fidler,Boris Bolliet,Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro,Julien Lesgourgues",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA),"We introduce CLAPP (CLASS LLM Agent for Pair Programming), an interactive AI assistant designed to support researchers working with the Einstein-Boltzmann solver CLASS. CLAPP leverages large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific retrieval to provide conversational coding support for CLASS-answering questions, generating code, debugging errors, and producing plots. Its architecture combines multi-agent LLM orchestration, semantic search across CLASS documentation, and a live Python execution environment. Deployed as a user-friendly web application, CLAPP lowers the entry barrier for scientists unfamiliar with AI tools and enables more productive human-AI collaboration in computational and numerical cosmology.

New submissions,"A long time ago in an LAE far, far away: a signpost of early reionization or a nascent AGN at $z=13$?","Joshua Cohon,Christopher Cain,Rogier Windhorst,Anson D'Aloisio,Timothy Carleton,Yongda Zhu",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The JADES survey recently reported the discovery of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA at $z = 13$, the highest redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) ever observed. This observation suggests that either the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is highly ionized, or the galaxy's intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission properties are extreme. We use radiative transfer simulations of reionization that capture the distribution of ionized gas in the $z = 13$ IGM to investigate the implications of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA for reionization. We find that if JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is a typical star forming galaxy (SFG) with properties characteristic of LAEs at $z \sim 6$, its detection suggests that the universe is $\gtrsim 5\%$ ionized by $z = 13$. We also investigate the possibility that the extreme properties of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA are driven by an AGN. Using a simple analysis based on the fact that AGN are expected to produce more ionizing photons than SFGs, we estimate that the likelihood that JADES-GS-z13-1-LA hosts an AGN is $88\%$, $66\%$, and $33\%$ if the IGM is $< 1\%$, $\approx 5\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ ionized, respectively. We also highlight other features in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA that may be indicative of AGN activity, including strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption extending to $\sim 1300$ angstroms, and a possible CII*$\lambda1335$ emission line. Our findings strongly motivate dedicated follow-up observations of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA to determine whether it hosts an AGN.",
New submissions,Detecting Model Misspecification in Cosmology with Scale-Dependent Normalizing Flows,"Aizhan Akhmetzhanova,Carolina Cuesta-Lazaro,Siddharth Mishra-Sharma",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Current and upcoming cosmological surveys will produce unprecedented amounts of high-dimensional data, which require complex high-fidelity forward simulations to accurately model both physical processes and systematic effects which describe the data generation process. However, validating whether our theoretical models accurately describe the observed datasets remains a fundamental challenge. An additional complexity to this task comes from choosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant cosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original dataset. In this work we present a novel framework combining scale-dependent neural summary statistics with normalizing flows to detect model misspecification in cosmological simulations through Bayesian evidence estimation. By conditioning our neural network models for data compression and evidence estimation on the smoothing scale, we systematically identify where theoretical models break down in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate a first application to our approach using matter and gas density fields from three CAMELS simulation suites with different subgrid physics implementations.",
New submissions,"Can dynamic dark energy explain the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low' effect, or strong baryon feedback?","S. Heydenreich,A. Leauthaud,J. DeRose",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the impact of a DESI motivated dynamic dark energy cosmology on three cosmological anomalies, the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low' effect, and observations of strong baryonic feedback. We analyze how these observations vary in $\Lambda$CDM versus dynamic dark energy. We find that the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal is reduced by up to 7% with respect to galaxy clustering and that cosmic shear is suppressed by 14%. These differences are primarily caused by changes to cosmological distance measures which enter the lensing efficiency kernels. In contrast, we find that dynamic dark energy increases the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich signal by about 15%, but that this is insufficient to substantially reduce the magnitude of baryonic effects. Thus, we find that dynamic dark energy may help explain two out of these three cosmological anomalies. DESI's dynamic dark energy has an important impact on cosmic expansion at $z\lesssim 0.5$, a regime where baryon acoustic oscillations are limited by the small volume. Because lensing is sensitive to distances, in addition to growth, we argue that lensing measurements are a promising alternative to constrain expansion deviations from $\Lambda$ at low redshifts.",
New submissions,Cosmological Parameter Estimation using Particle Swarm Optimization,"Daniel Morales Hernández,Gabriela Garcia-Arroyo,J. Alberto Vazquez",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The search for the model or ingredients that describe the current vision of our cosmos has led to the creation of a set of highly favorable experiments, and therefore a great flow of information. Due to this torrent of information and the need to analyze it exhaustively, the main aim of this paper is to introduce the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a complement to traditional cosmological data analysis. The PSO is one of the most representative Bio-inspired algorithms as provides excellent robustness in high-dimensional or complex problems with relative simplicity and small number of parameters during the implementation. In this work we implemented two versions of the canonical PSO algorithm: global best and local best, to explore dark energy models in the light of Type Ia Supernovae and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations observations, in particular, DESI and DESI+Union3 datasets. The results achieved validate the performance of the PSO algorithm in finding the best-fit parameters from observational data and confirm that PSO, under certain conditions, can deliver competitive results, at a fraction of time, compared to standard MCMC methods. Finally, the PSO output can also serve as a valuable input to the MCMC methods to speed up its analysis.",
New submissions,Stacked Hybrid RNN-CNN Reconstruction of X-ray Influence on 21-cm Brightness Temperature,"S. Mobina Hosseini,Bahareh Soleimanpour Salmasi",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The X-ray photons substantially affect the thermal and ionization states of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), thereby significantly influencing the 21-cm line observables such as its sky-averaged (global) brightness temperature. Nevertheless, the complicated dependency of astrophysical processes on a broad spectrum of parameters, including X-ray efficiency, spectral characteristics, and gas dynamics, makes precisely simulating the effect of X-ray flux challenging. Traditional approaches, including N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, are computationally intensive and struggle to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces efficiently. We present a stacked hybrid model trained on a specific simulation intended to reconstruct the effect of X-ray flux on the global 21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR. Along with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this architecture combines two substantial forms of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), therefore enabling fast adaptation to several X-ray flux levels. Without demanding repeated simulations, this emulator preserves temporal and spatial dependencies and generalizes to unseen parameter combinations. This matter reduces computation time by a factor of one million while preserving excellent prediction accuracy of 99.93\%, facilitating studies on high-dimensional parameter inference and sensitivity with an error margin of less than 0.35 mK. Our LSTM-GRU-CNN emulator combines recurrent and convolutional architectures to enable a robust and scalable analysis of X-ray heating effects on the global 21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR.",
New submissions,AllBRICQS: The Discovery of Luminous Quasars in the Northern Hemisphere,"Yunyi Choi,Yuming Fu,Myungshin Im,Xue-Bing Wu,Christopher A. Onken,Christian Wolf,Seo-Won Chang,Hyeonho Choi,Mankeun Jeong,Yongjung Kim,Gu Lim,Yuxuan Pang,Taewan Kim,Jubee Sohn,Dohyeong Kim,Ji Hoon Kim,Eunhee Ko,Gregory S. H. Paek,Sungho Jung",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present the second catalog of bright quasars from the All-sky BRIght, Complete Quasar Survey (AllBRICQS), focusing on spectroscopically observed quasars in the Northern Hemisphere with Galactic latitude $|b| > 10^\circ$. This catalog includes their spectral data, redshifts, and luminosities. AllBRICQS aims to identify the last remaining optically bright quasars using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Gaia all-sky survey Data Release 3 (DR3). AllBRICQS searches for quasars that are brighter than $B_P = 16.5$ or $R_P = 16$ mag in Gaia DR3, based on simple selection criteria. Here, we report 62 new AllBRICQS quasars spanning various types, which include typical broad emission line quasars and the most luminous iron low-ionization broad absorption line quasars discovered to date. Spectroscopic observations were conducted using the Long-Slit Spectrograph on the 1.8-meter telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, YFOSC on the 2.4-meter telescope at Lijiang Observatory, and BFOSC on the 2.16-meter telescope at Xinglong Observatory. We applied flux calibration using ZTF broadband photometry to correct for attenuation due to intermittent thin clouds during the observations. Redshifts were determined using inverse-variance weighted cross-correlation methods. Our targets span the bolometric luminosity range of $44.9<\log \left( L_{\rm bol} / {\rm erg~s^{-1}} \right)<48.0$ at redshifts between 0.09 and 2.48. These confirmed AllBRICQS quasars provide a valuable resource for future research into quasar evolution, black holes, their environments, and their host galaxies across multiple wavelengths.",
New submissions,A Targeted Gamma-Ray Search of Five Prominent Galaxy Merger Systems with 17 years of Fermi-LAT Data,"Siddhant Manna,Shantanu Desai",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission. The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $< 5$). This is the first targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger systems.",
New submissions,Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess morphology of dark matter in simulations of the Milky Way galaxy,"Moorits Mihkel Muru,Joseph Silk,Noam I. Libeskind,Stefan Gottloeber,Yehuda Hoffman",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The strongest experimental evidence for dark matter is the Galactic Center gamma-ray excess observed by the Fermi telescope and even predicted prior to discovery as a potential dark matter signature via WIMP dark matter self-annihilations. However, an equally compelling explanation of the excess gamma-ray flux appeals to a population of old millisecond pulsars that also accounts for the observed boxy morphology inferred from the bulge old star population. We employ a set of Milky Way-like galaxies found in the Hestia constrained simulations of the local universe to explore the rich morphology of the central dark matter distribution, motivated by the GAIA discovery of a vigorous early merging history of the Milky Way galaxy. We predict a significantly non-spherical gamma-ray morphology from the WIMP interpretation. Future experiments, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array, that extend to higher energies, should distinguish between the competing interpretations.",
Cross submissions,Stable Islands of Weak Gravity,"Linus Thummel,Benjamin Bose,Alkistis Pourtsidou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$, and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force. Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI $w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.",
Cross submissions,Illuminating Scalar Dark Matter Co-Scattering in EFT with Monophoton Signatures,"Geneviève Bélanger,Manimala Mitra,Rojalin Padhan,Abhishek Roy",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the co-scattering mechanism for dark matter production in an EFT framework which contains new $Z_2$-odd singlets, namely two fermions $N_{1,2}$ and a real scalar $\chi$. The singlet scalar $\chi$ is the dark matter candidate. The dimension-5 operators play a vital role to set the observed DM relic density. We focus on a nearly degenerate mass spectrum for the $Z_2$ odd particles to allow for a significant contribution from the co-scattering or co-annihilation mechanisms. We present two benchmark points where either of the two mechanisms primarily set the DM relic abundance. The main constraint on the model at the LHC arise from the ATLAS mono-$\gamma$ search. We obtain the parameter space allowed by the observed relic density and the mono-$\gamma$ search after performing a scan over the key parameters, the masses $M_{N_{1,2}}, M_\chi$ and couplings $c_3^\prime, Y^\prime_{11,22}$. We find the region of parameter space where the relic abundance is set primarily by the co-scattering mechanism while being allowed by the LHC search. We also determine how the model can be further probed at the HL-LHC via the mono-$\gamma$ signature.",
Cross submissions,Dark Sector Electroweak Baryogenesis In Light Of The Galactic Center Excess,"Jean-Samuel Roux,James M. Cline",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We revisit a model of electroweak baryogenesis that includes a dark matter candidate, and sequesters the new CP violation required to produce the baryon asymmetry in a dark sector. The model can successfully explain the baryon asymmetry, dark matter relic density, and the long-standing excess of gamma rays from the galactic center. The first order electroweak phase transition induced by the new physics can give rise to gravitational waves that may be observed in future experiments. The model predicts dark matter signals in direct detectors, and a significant contribution to the Higgs boson invisible decay width.",
