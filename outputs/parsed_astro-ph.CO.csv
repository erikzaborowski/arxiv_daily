New submissions,Patchy Helium and Hydrogen Reionization from the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect and Galaxies,"Neha Anil Kumar,Mesut Çalışkan,Selim C. Hotinli,Marc Kamionkowski,Simone Ferraro,Kendrick Smith",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments will measure temperature fluctuations on small angular scales with unprecedented precision, enabling improved measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. This secondary anisotropy has emerged as a valuable probe of the distribution of ionized electrons in the post-recombination Universe. Although the sensitivity of the kSZ effect has recently been utilized to study the high-redshift epoch of hydrogen (H) reionization, its redshift-integrated nature -- combined with anticipated improvements in measurement precision -- suggests that accounting for the later epoch of helium (He) reionization will become increasingly important in the near future. Joint characterization of the epochs will allow for a more coherent understanding of early-star and -quasar formation, as these sources drive the ionization of H and He in the intergalactic medium. In this paper, we extend the kSZ higher-order statistic introduced by Smith \& Ferraro (2017) to forecast the ability of upcoming CMB surveys to probe the morphology of both H and He reionization. Moreover, given that upcoming large-scale structure surveys will trace density fluctuations at redshifts overlapping with the epoch of He reionization, we propose a novel cross-correlation between the kSZ higher-order statistic and galaxy survey measurements. Using a joint information-matrix analysis of H and He reionization, we show that next-generation CMB and galaxy surveys will have sufficient statistical power to characterize the patchy morphology of H reionization and set constraints on the redshift evolution of its He counterpart.",
New submissions,Modeling Gravitational Wave Bias from 3D Power Spectra of Spectroscopic Surveys,"Dorsa Sadat Hosseini,Amir Dehghani,J. Leo Kim,Alex Krolewski,Suvodip Mukherjee,Ghazal Geshnizjani",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present a framework for relating gravitational wave (GW) sources to the astrophysical properties of spectroscopic galaxy samples. We show how this can enable using clustering measurements of gravitational wave (GW) sources to infer the relationship between the GW sources and the astrophysical properties of their host galaxies. We accomplish this by creating mock GW catalogs from the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 galaxy survey. We populate the GWs using a joint host-galaxy probability function defined over stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity. This probability is modeled as the product of three broken power-law distributions, each with a turnover point motivated by astrophysical processes governing the relation between current-day galaxy properties and BBH mergers, such as galaxy quenching and BBH delay time. Our results show that GW bias is most sensitive to host-galaxy probability dependence on stellar mass, with increases of up to $\sim O (10)\%$ relative to galaxy bias as the stellar mass pivot scale rises. We also find a notable relationship between GW bias and SFR: when the host-galaxy probability favors low-SFR galaxies, the GW bias significantly increases. In contrast, we observe no strong correlation between GW bias and metallicity. These findings suggest that the spatial clustering of GW sources is primarily driven by the stellar mass and SFR of their host galaxies and shows how GW bias measurements can inform models of the host-galaxy probability function.",
New submissions,JWST lens model for A370: A very low dark matter fraction for a brightest cluster galaxy and lensing properties for the Dragon arc,"Jose M. Diego,Fengwu Sun,Jose M. Palencia,Xiaojing Lin,Marceau Limousin,Rachel Gledhill,Anna Niemiec,Wenlei Chen,Rogier A. Windhorst,Mitchell F. Strubble,Tom Broadhurst",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present a new lens model for the $z=0.375$ galaxy cluster Abell 370 based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program. Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more consistent with alternative models to $\Lambda$CDM. We discuss possible causes for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation. We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at $z=0.7251$. The new lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening microlenses.",
New submissions,Primordial black holes in cosmological simulations: growth prospects for supermassive black holes,"Lewis R. Prole,John A. Regan,Daxal Mehta,Peter Coles,Pratika Dayal",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"It has long been suggested that a fraction of the dark matter in the Universe could exist in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have existed since the radiation dominated era. Recent studies have suggested that these PBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we have included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink to the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions experience significant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of $f_{\rm PBH}$ = $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M$_\odot$, as inspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-3}$, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow to $10^{4}$-$10^{5}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=20$. These intermediate black holes (IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such as GNZ-11 ($10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=10$), outperforming light seed black hole (BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding prescriptions. On the other hand, $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-4}$ resulted in no significant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH seeds is sensitive to the true value of $f_{\rm PBH}$ in the Universe, and showing that the $f_{\rm PBH} =10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ boundary marks the threshold above which SMBH seeding via 1000 M$_\odot$ PBHs becomes effective. This is the first step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological simulations.",
New submissions,Large-Scale-Structure Observables in General Relativity Validated at Second Order,"Antoine Villey,Yonadav Barry Ginat,Vincent Desjacques,Donghui Jeong,Fabian Schmidt",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a second-order calculation of relativistic large-scale-structure observables in cosmological perturbation theory, specifically the ""cosmic rulers and clock"", which are the building-blocks of any other large-scale-structure observable, including galaxy number counts, on large scales. We calculate the scalar rulers (longitudinal perturbation and magnification) and the cosmic clock to second order, using a fully non-linear covariant definition of the observables. We validate our formulae on three non-trivial space-time metrics: two of them are null tests on metrics which are obtained by applying a gauge transformation to the background space-time, while the third is the ""separate universe"" curved background, for which we can also compute the observables exactly. We then illustrate the results by evaluating the second-order observables in a simplified symmetric setup. On large scales, they are suppressed over the linear contributions by $\sim 10^{-4}$, while they become comparable to the linear contributions on mildly non-linear scales. The results of this paper form a significant (and the most complicated) part of the relativistic galaxy number density at second order.",
New submissions,Semi-empirical constraints on the HI mass function of star-forming galaxies and $Ω_{\rm HI}$ at $z\sim 0.37$ from interferometric surveys,"Francesco Sinigaglia,Alessandro Bianchetti,Giulia Rodighiero,Lucio Mayer,Miroslava Dessauges-Zavadsky,Ed Elson,Mattia Vaccari,Matt J. Jarvis",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The HI mass function is a crucial tool to understand the evolution of the HI content in galaxies over cosmic times and to constrain both the baryon cycle in galaxy evolution and the reionization history of the Universe. We aim to derive semi-empirical constraints at $z\sim 0.37$ by combining literature results on the stellar mass function from optical surveys with recent findings on the $M_{\rm HI}-M_\star$ scaling relation derived via spectral stacking analysis applied to 21-cm line interferometric data from the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys, conducted with MeerKAT and the VLA, respectively. We draw synthetic stellar mass samples directly from the publicly-available results underlying the analysis of the COSMOS2020 galaxy photometric sample. Afterwards, we convert $M_\star$ into $M_{\rm HI}$ using analytical fitting functions to the data points from HI stacking. We then fit a Schechter function to the median HIMF from all the samples via MCMC. We finally derive the posterior distribution for $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ by integrating the models for the HIMF built from the posteriors samples of the Schechter parameters. We find evolution of the HIMF at $z\sim 0.37$ with respect to results at $z\sim 0$ from the ALFALFA survey and at $z\sim 1$ from uGMRT data. Our results for $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ are in broad agreement with other literature results, and follow the trend on $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ as a function of redshift. The derived value $\Omega_{\rm HI}=\left(7.02^{+0.59}_{-0.52}\right)\times10^{-4}$ at $z\sim 0.37$ from the combined analysis deviates at $ \sim 2.9\sigma$ from the ALFALFA result at $z\sim 0$. We conclude that the HIMF and $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ constraints that we derive from state-of-the-art deep interferometric surveys suggest an evolution of the HIMF and of the cosmic HI density, supporting a picture of smooth transition of the HI content of galaxies from $z\sim 0$ to $z\sim 1$.",
New submissions,Merger History of Clustered Primordial Black Holes,Viktor Stasenko,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Primordial black hole (PBH) binaries experience strong gravitational perturbations in the case of their initial clustering, which significantly affects the dynamics of their mergers. In this work, we develop a new formalism to account for these perturbations and track the evolution of the binary orbital parameters distribution. Based on this approach, we calculate the merger rate of PBH binaries and demonstrate that its temporal evolution differs greatly from that of isolated binary systems. Moreover, PBH clustering produces distinctive features in the stochastic gravitational-wave background: the canonical $2/3$ spectral slope transforms to $\Omega_{\rm gw} \propto \nu^{-65/28}$ in a certain frequency band. These predictions can be probed in future gravitational wave observations, opening up new opportunities to test the clustering of PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.",
New submissions,Geometric Cosmology models: statistical analysis with observational data,"Matías Leizerovich,Luisa G. Jaime,Susana J. Landau,Gustavo Arciniega",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Although the standard cosmological model is capable of explaining most current observational data, it faces some theoretical and observational issues. This is the main motivation for exploring alternative cosmological models. In this paper, we focus on a novel proposal that consists in adding an infinite tower of higher-order curvature invariants to the usual Einstein-Hilbert action. We obtain the late-time background evolution for three families of models that can be obtained from this proposal. We use recent data from Cosmic Chronometers and type Ia supernovae to test the late-time predictions of our models. In addition, we consider estimations from the Age of the Older Globular Clusters to constrain our models. While some of the studied cases are ruled out by the data, we show that there are particular cases of the GILA model that can explain current data.",
New submissions,X-ray investigation of the remarkable galaxy group Nest200047,"Anwesh Majumder,A. Simionescu,T. Plšek,M. Brienza,E. Churazov,I. Khabibullin,F. Gastaldello,A. Botteon,H. Röttgering,M. Brüggen,N. Lyskova,K. Rajpurohit,R.A. Sunyaev,M.W. Wise",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Galaxy groups are more susceptible to feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5) \times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of $2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation. Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.",
New submissions,Addressing the $H_0$ tension through matter with pressure and no early dark energy,"Youri Carloni,Orlando Luongo,Marco Muccino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose that the Hubble tension arises due to an unaccounted additional component, that behaves as \emph{matter with pressure}. We demonstrate that this fluid remains subdominant compared to both dust and radiation throughout nearly the entire universe expansion history. Specifically, the additional fluid satisfies the Zel'dovic limit with a constant equation of state, $\omega_s > 0$, and a quite small normalized energy density, $\Omega_s$. Accordingly, this component modifies both the sound horizon and the background expansion rate, \emph{acting quite differently from early dark energy models}, without significantly affecting the other cosmological parameters. To show this, we perform a Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis of our model, hereafter dubbed $\Lambda_{\omega_s}$CDM paradigm, using the publicly available \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code. Our results confirm the presence of this fluid, with properties that closely resemble those of radiation. We find best-fit values that satisfy $\omega_s \lesssim \omega_\gamma$ and a relative energy density $\Omega_s / \Omega_\gamma = 0.45$, with $\omega_r$ and $\Omega_r$ the equation of state and density of photons, respectively. The effective fluid may be associated with generalized K-essence models or, alternatively, with Proca-type vector fields, albeit we do not exclude \emph{a priori} more exotic possibilities, i.e., dark radiation, axions, and so on. Physical implications of our results are analyzed in detail, indicating a statistical preference for the $\Lambda_{\omega_s}$CDM scenario over the conventional $\Lambda$CDM background.",
New submissions,Unveiling a Population of Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lensed Faint Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies,"Ting-Kai Yang,Chian-Chou Chen,Zhen-Kai Gao,Bovornpratch Vijarnwannaluk,Adarsh Ranjan,Wei-Hao Wang,Caitlin M. Casey,Tomotsugu Goto,Jeyhan S. Kartaltepe,Chayan Mondal,James Pearson,Chris Sedgwick,Stephen Serjeant",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The measurements of the number density of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses can be used to put statistical constraints on the foreground mass distributions. Dusty galaxies uncovered in submillimeter surveys are particularly useful in this regard because of the large volume probed by these surveys. Previous discoveries of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed dusty galaxies are predominantly the brightest in the sky discovered by Herschel, SPT, and Planck. However, models have also predicted a non-negligible fraction of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty galaxies, which were difficult to confirm due to technical difficulties. Utilizing the deepest SCUBA-2 submillimeter survey, STUDIES, in both the COSMOS and the UDS fields, together with a red JWST color selection method, we discover a population of 13 strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty galaxies. The rich ancillary data allow us to confirm their strongly lensed nature via estimates of redshifts and lens modeling. Our systematic search has allowed us to construct the 450$\mu$m number counts of strongly lensed sources down to the flux levels about an order of magnitude fainter than previous measurements. The measured lensing fractions of $\sim$1% are consistent with predictions from models that also successfully produce the number density of the strong galaxy-galaxy lensed bright dusty galaxies. Future searches from Euclid and Roman are expected to discover orders of magnitude more strongly lensed faint dusty galaxies.",
New submissions,Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the Weighted Function Regression method,"Alex González-Fuentes,Adrià Gómez-Valent",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed.",
New submissions,Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice II: Nonperturbative Curvature Perturbation,"Angelo Caravano,Gabriele Franciolini,Sébastien Renaux-Petel",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Building on the recent lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics presented inarXiv:2410.23942, we investigate the role of the nonlinear relation between the inflaton field configuration and the curvature perturbation $\zeta$, the key observable after inflation. Using a nonperturbative $\delta N$ approach applied to the lattice output, we generate fully nonlinear three-dimensional maps of $\zeta$. This calculation captures both the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear mapping between $\phi$ and $\zeta$, and the intrinsic non-Gaussianity generated around Hubble crossing by the nonlinear field dynamics, which is neglected in stochastic approaches. We find that the nonlinear mapping has a profound impact on the statistics, significantly enhancing the positive tail of the $\zeta$ probability distribution, with important implications for observable quantities. A central part of this work is the comparison with the standard perturbative treatment based on a gauge transformation, which allows us to quantify when and how the perturbative picture breaks down as fluctuations grow large. Together witharXiv:2410.23942, this work sets the basis for robust, nonperturbative predictions of primordial black hole production and scalar-induced gravitational wave emission from inflation using lattice simulations.",
New submissions,InflationEasy: A C++ Lattice Code for Inflation,Angelo Caravano,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"InflationEasy is the first lattice code specifically developed for cosmological inflation. It simulates the nonlinear dynamics of a scalar field on a three-dimensional lattice in an expanding FLRW universe, using finite-difference spatial derivatives and a staggered leapfrog integrator for time evolution. Based in part on the well-known LATTICEEASY, it incorporates several improvements tailored to inflationary applications. Among other features, InflationEasy implements a nonperturbative $\delta N$ method to compute the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation $\zeta$ directly from the lattice, enabling fully nonlinear studies of scenarios with large fluctuations or nonperturbative non-Gaussianities. The code supports a broad range of inflationary models, including those relevant for primordial black hole formation, gravitational wave production, and large-scale structure. This makes InflationEasy a versatile and lightweight tool for studying inflationary dynamics beyond the reach of perturbation theory.",
New submissions,Testing Coasting Cosmologies with Large-Scale Structure Growth,"Dávid A. Ködmön,Péter Raffai",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We derive analytical expressions for the growth factor, $D(z)$, and density-weighted growth rate, $f\sigma_8(z)$, for coasting cosmologies, in which the scale factor is a linear function of time. We fit the latter to data from redshift space distortion measurements in the redshift range $z<2$ using the \texttt{dynesty} implementation of a nested sampling algorithm. In total, four models are tested: three coasting models with curvature parameters ${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ in $H^2_0c^{-2}$ units, as well as a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We evaluate each model's consistency with the data by applying an Anderson-Darling test for normality on the normalized residuals. For the coasting models, we obtained ${\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=\{ 0.206^{+0.073}_{-0.061},\, 0.297^{+0.085}_{-0.073},\, 0.412^{+0.097}_{-0.086}}\}$ and ${\sigma_{8}(z=0)=\{1.071^{+0.213}_{-0.151},\,0.867^{+0.128}_{-0.097},\,0.725^{+0.080}_{-0.065}\}}$. Fitting the $\Lambda$CDM model yielded ${\{\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=0.286_{-0.047}^{+0.053},\,\sigma_{8}(z=0)= 0.764_{-0.035}^{+0.039}\}}$. All four models are consistent with the data, though coasting models are weakly favored over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\log$-Bayes factors of ${\log_{10}{\mathcal{B}} = \{0.197,\, 0.234,\,0.272\}}$. We also examined whether the $S_8$ tension can be resolved by linear expansion restricted to $z<2$. The curve fitting yielded ${S_8=\{0.890^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.865^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.850^{+0.026}_{-0.026}\}}$ for the ${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ coasting models, respectively, resulting in ${\Delta S^\mathrm{Coasting}_8=\{1.94\sigma,\,1.07\sigma,\,0.52\sigma\}}$ discrepancies with the standard $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 value. The tension level was the highest for the $\Lambda$CDM model, as the constraint from our fit is $S_8=0.746^{+0.041}_{-0.039}$, indicating a tension level of ${\Delta S_8^{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}=2.00\sigma}$.",
New submissions,On the prospects of thermalization of axion-SU(2) inflation,"Sukannya Bhattacharya,Matteo Fasiello,Alexandros Papageorgiou,Ema Dimastrogiovanni",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Axion inflation models coupled to a gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of conservative criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.",

Ivy Wong",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Atomic hydrogen constitutes the gas reservoir from which molecular gas and star formation in galaxies emerges. However, the weakness of the line means it has been difficult to directly detect in all but the very local Universe. Here we present results from the first search using the MeerKAT International Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey for high-redshift ($z>0.25$) H{\sc i} emission from individual galaxies. By searching for 21-cm emission centered on the position and redshift of optically-selected emission-line galaxies we overcome difficulties that hinder untargeted searches. We detect 11 galaxies at $z>0.25$, forming the first sample of $z>0.25$ detections with an interferometer, with the highest redshift detection at $z = 0.3841$. We find they have much larger H{\sc i} masses than their low-redshift H{\sc i}-selected counterparts for a given stellar mass. This can be explained by the much larger cosmological volume probed at these high redshifts, and does not require any evolution of the H{\sc i} mass function. We make the first-ever measurement of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFr) with H{\sc i} at $z>0.25$ and find consistency with the local bTFr, but with tentative evidence of a flattening in the relation at these redshifts for higher-mass objects. This may signify evolution, in line with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations, or that the molecular gas mass in these high-mass galaxies could be significant. This study paves the way for future studies of H{\sc i} beyond the local Universe, using both searches targeted at known objects and via pure H{\sc i} selection.",
New submissions,Calibrating baryonic effects in cosmic shear with external data in the LSST era,"Amy Wayland,David Alonso,Matteo Zennaro",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Cosmological constraints derived from weak lensing (WL) surveys are limited by baryonic effects, which suppress the non-linear matter power spectrum on small scales. By combining WL measurements with data from external tracers of the gas around massive structures, it is possible to calibrate baryonic effects and, therefore, obtain more precise cosmological constraints. In this study, we generate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon Correction Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to which the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the cosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of baryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and determine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\sim 10$-$20\%$ to avoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints. We forecast that long-term X-ray data from $\sim 5000$ clusters should be able to reach this threshold for the parameters that characterise the abundance of hot virialised gas. Constraining the distribution of ejected gas presents a greater challenge, however, but we forecast that long-term kSZ data from a CMB-S4-like experiment should achieve the level of precision required for full self-calibration.",
New submissions,Bayesian and frequentist perspectives agree on dynamical dark energy,"Laura Herold,Tanvi Karwal",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) show evidence of a deviation from a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ within a Bayesian analysis. In this work, we validate that frequentist constraints from profile likelihoods on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameters $w_0$, $w_a$ are in excellent agreement with the Bayesian constraints when combining with Planck cosmic microwave background, Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing, and either Pantheon+ or Dark Energy Survey Y5 supernova data. Further, we assess which datasets drive these constraints by considering the contributions to the $\chi^2$ from the individual datasets. For profile likelihoods of the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, such an investigation shows internal inconsistencies when assuming $\Lambda$, which are resolved when assuming a $w_0w_a$ dark-energy model. We infer the equations of state $w(z)$ at the pivot redshifts, supporting previous interpretations that current data appears to be more sensitive to the derivative of $w(z)$ rather than a mean offset from $\Lambda$. Thus our frequentist analysis corroborates previous findings on dynamical DE.",
Cross submissions,Phase space and Data analyses of a non-minimally coupled scalar field system with decaying dark energy model,"Yerlan Myrzakulov,Saddam Hussain,M. Shahalam",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate a class of scalar field dark energy models non-minimally coupled to gravity, characterized by a double exponential potential and parameterized coupling {\xi}. First, we study the cosmological dynamics for a recently proposed Q-SC-CDM model. Initially, we choose two distinct values of {\xi}: 0.1 and 0.5. In case of {\xi}=0.1, the evolution of the universe is split up into three different phases: deceleration, acceleration and slow-contraction, and provide Big Crunch Singularity at distant future. However, in case of {\xi}=0.5, the phase of slow-contraction vanishes, correspondingly Big Crunch Singularity is redundant. Second, we perform the phase space analysis for Q-SC-CDM, bring new asymptotic regimes and find stable de-Sitter solution. Finally, fixing {\xi} to two representative values: {\xi} = 0.1 and 0.05, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using recent late-time cosmological observations, including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (DESI DR2) data. Our results demonstrate that both models yield constraints on key cosmological parameters \Omega_{0m}, H_0 and the sound horizon r_d that are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM within 68\% confidence level, yet exhibit mild tension with Pantheon+ measurements. We analyze the evolution of the effective equation of state, showing that the model transitions from a stiff matter phase at high redshift to a dark energy dominated phase with effective equation of state less than -0.5 at late times. Additionally, we employ the Om(z) diagnostic to distinguish our model from {\Lambda}CDM, finding minimal deviation up to redshift z \sim 2. Statistical model comparison using Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) Information Criteria reveals moderate support for the model with {\xi} = 0.1, though {\Lambda}CDM remains statistically preferred.",
Cross submissions,Acoustically driven dark matter freeze-out,"Iason Baldes,Ryusuke Jinno",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We extend the study of the effect of density perturbations to the well known thermal dark matter freeze-out scenario. We find $\sim 10 \, \%$ enhancements in the cross section are required to match onto the observed relic abundance for primordial curvature perturbations $\sim 0.2$ at length scales $\sim 1/$Hubble at freeze-out. Such corrections may be of importance in scenarios in which such perturbations are present and observational signals, such as the indirect detection rate, depend sensitively on the DM mass and freeze-out cross section, e.g. near resonances associated with DM bound states.",
