New submissions,Super-Eddington accretion in protogalactic cores,"Tommaso Zana,Pedro R. Capelo,Mairo Boresta,Raffaella Schneider,Alessandro Lupi,Alessandro Trinca,Lucio Mayer,Rosa Valiante,Luca Graziani",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding $10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ already at redshift $z > 6$ challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \sim 15$, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\sim$1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.",
New submissions,The COLIBRE project: cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution,"Joop Schaye,Evgenii Chaikin,Matthieu Schaller,Sylvia Ploeckinger,Filip Huško,Rob McGibbon,James W. Trayford,Alejandro Benítez-Llambay,Camila Correa,Carlos S. Frenk,Alexander J. Richings,Victor J. Forouhar Moreno,Yannick M. Bahé,Josh Borrow,Anna Durrant,Andrea Gebek,John C. Helly,Adrian Jenkins,Cedric G. Lacey,Aaron Ludlow,Folkert S. J. Nobels",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present the COLIBRE galaxy formation model and the COLIBRE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. COLIBRE includes new models for radiative cooling, dust grains, star formation, stellar mass loss, turbulent diffusion, pre-supernova stellar feedback, supernova feedback, supermassive black holes and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The multiphase interstellar medium is explicitly modelled without a pressure floor. Hydrogen and helium are tracked in non-equilibrium, with their contributions to the free electron density included in metal-line cooling calculations. The chemical network is coupled to a dust model that tracks three grain species and two grain sizes. In addition to the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback, a subset of simulations uses black hole spin-dependent hybrid jet/thermal AGN feedback. To suppress spurious transfer of energy from dark matter to stars, dark matter is supersampled by a factor 4, yielding similar dark matter and baryonic particle masses. The subgrid feedback model is calibrated to match the observed $z \approx 0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes, and black hole masses in massive galaxies. The COLIBRE suite includes three resolutions, with particle masses of $\sim 10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7\,\text{M}_\odot$ in cubic volumes of up to 50, 200, and 400 cMpc on a side, respectively. The two largest runs use 136 billion ($5 \times 3008^3$) particles. We describe the model, assess its strengths and limitations, and present both visual impressions and quantitative results. Comparisons with various low-redshift galaxy observations generally show very good numerical convergence and excellent agreement with the data.",
New submissions,Cosmic Variance in Anisotropy Searches at Pulsar Timing Arrays,"Valerie Domcke,Gabriele Franciolini,Mauro Pieroni",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses show evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) with angular correlations consistent with the Hellings-Downs curve. Anisotropies are a key discriminator of the origin of this GWB, as they are expected to be at 1--20\% for astrophysical sources, but suppressed for cosmological GWBs. However, contrary to gravitational wave detectors at higher frequencies, PTAs only take a few independent measurements of a GWB and consequently are highly sensitive to cosmic variance, which induces apparent anisotropies in individual realizations of an isotropic GWB. We demonstrate explicitly that statistical inference nevertheless remains robust, i.e., measurements are consistent with the underlying assumption of isotropy. This confirms that searches for anisotropies will be able to robustly discriminate astrophysical from cosmological GWBs. En route, we demonstrate that the maximum multipole constrained by a PTA dataset scales linearly with the number of pulsars $\ell_{\rm max} \sim N_p$.",
New submissions,How does feedback affect the star formation histories of galaxies?,"Kartheik G. Iyer,Tjitske K. Starkenburg,Greg L. Bryan,Rachel S.

Wu",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Star formation in galaxies is regulated by the interplay of a range of processes that shape the multiphase gas in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Using the CAMELS suite of cosmological simulations, we study the effects of varying feedback and cosmology on the average star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at $z\sim0$ across the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and ASTRID galaxy formation models. We find that galaxy SFHs in all three models are sensitive to changes in stellar feedback, which affects the efficiency of baryon cycling and the rates at which central black holes grow, while effects of varying AGN feedback depend on model-dependent implementations of black hole seeding, accretion and feedback. We also find strong interaction terms that couple stellar and AGN feedback, usually by regulating the amount of gas available for the central black hole to accrete. Using a double power-law to describe the average SFHs, we derive a general set of equations relating the shape of the SFHs to physical quantities like baryon fraction and black hole mass across all three models. We find that a single set of equations (albeit with different coefficients) can describe the SFHs across all three CAMELS models, with cosmology dominating the SFH at early times, followed by halo accretion, and feedback and baryon cycling at late times. Galaxy SFHs provide a novel, complementary probe to constrain cosmology and feedback, and can connect the observational constraints from current and upcoming galaxy surveys with the physical mechanisms responsible for regulating galaxy growth and quenching.",
New submissions,Probing the H0 Tension with Holographic Dark Energy in Unimodular Gravity: Insights from DESI DR2,"Francisco Plaza,Gabriel León,Lucila Kraiselburd",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Motivated by the recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI DR2 collaboration, this works presents an extended analysis of a cosmological model based on holographic dark energy within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. We probe the model with an extensive set of observations: cosmic chronometers, Pantheon Plus$+$SH0ES Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO distances, quasar X-ray/UV fluxes (two independent calibrations), and Planck 2018 CMB data. The results are analyzed to assess the modelś ability to alleviate the Hubble tension and, in comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, to determine which of the two scenarios is preferred according to Bayesian evidence. We conclude that the present implementation of holographic dark energy in Unimodular Gravity, while theoretically appealing, does not alleviate the Hubble tension and is not statistically preferred by Bayesian criteria when compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, in neither case does the preference become very strong or conclusive against it.",
New submissions,The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements,"Shengyu He,Jiaxi Yu,Antoine Rocher,Daniel Forero-Sánchez,Jean-Paul Kneib,Cheng Zhao,Etienne Burtin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. We investigate their impact on full-shape clustering analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a damping effect on the power spectrum. This damping is scale-dependent and absorbed by counterterms in the clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$ for the DESI survey. Catastrophic failures reduce the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor scaling with contamination rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for the DESI ELG populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. For this case, shifts from $6\%$ to $16\%$ ($\sim2.2\sigma$ level) arise in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying a correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value during fitting successfully restores the unbiased posterior without loss in constraint. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, an accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological constraints. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, we find that redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but lead to slightly weaker constraints on $\sum m_\nu$.",

New submissions,One-Loop Nonlinear Matter Power Spectrum from Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory: Fast Computation and Comparison with Emulators,Naonori Sugiyama,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a fast and accurate formulation for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum at one-loop order based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). ULPT decomposes the density field into the Jacobian deviation, capturing intrinsic nonlinear growth, and the displacement-mapping factor, accounting for large-scale distortions due to bulk flows. This structural separation leads to a natural division of the power spectrum into a source term and a displacement-mapping factor, ensuring infrared (IR) safety by construction. We implement an efficient numerical algorithm using FFTLog and FAST-PT, achieving approximately 2-second evaluations on a standard laptop. The results are validated against simulation-based emulators, including the Dark Emulator and Euclid Emulator 2. Across 100 sampled cosmologies, ULPT agrees with emulator predictions at the 2--3\% level up to \( k \simeq 0.4\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \) for \( z \geq 0.5 \), without any nuisance parameters. Similar agreement is found in configuration space, where the two-point correlation function remains accurate down to \( r \simeq 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc} \). Compared to standard perturbation theory, which fails at small scales due to series expansion of the displacement factor, ULPT maintains convergence by preserving its full exponential form. We also clarify the mechanism of BAO damping: exponential suppression by displacement and peak sharpening by nonlinear growth. The combination accurately reproduces BAO features seen in simulations. ULPT thus offers a robust, IR-safe, and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. The numerical implementation developed in this work is publicly released as the open-source Python package \texttt{ulptkit} (this https URL).",
New submissions,The Bigfoot: A footprint of a Coma cluster progenitor at z=3.98,"Hanwen Sun,Tao Wang,Emanuele Daddi,Qiaoyang Hao,Ke Xu,David Elbaz,Luwenjia Zhou,Houjun Mo,Huiyuan Wang,Longyue Chen,Yangyao Chen,Shuowen Jin,Yipeng Lyu,Nikolaj Sillassen,Kai Wang,Tiancheng Yang",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Protoclusters, galaxy clusters' high redshift progenitors, hold the keys to understanding the formation and evolution of clusters and their member galaxies. However, their cosmological distances and spatial extensions (tens of Mpc) have inhibited complete mapping of their structure and constituent galaxies, which is key to robustly linking protoclusters to their descendants. Here we report the discovery of the Bigfoot, a tridimensional structure at $z = 3.98$ including 11 subgroups traced by 55 (700) spectroscopic (photometric) redshifts with JWST, extending over $15\times 37$ $\times 49{\rm{cMpc^3}}$ in the PRIMER-UDS field. Bigfoot's large-scale and mass function of member galaxies closely match constrained simulations' predictions for the progenitors of today's most massive clusters (${M_0} > 10^{15} {M_{_ \odot }}$). All subgroups with ${M_{\rm{h}}} > {10^{12.5}}{M_{_ \odot }}$ exhibit enhanced fractions of massive galaxies ($>{10^{10.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) compared to lower-mass halos and the field, demonstrating the accelerated formation of massive galaxies in massive halos. The presence of this massive protocluster with a large central halo (${10^{13.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) in a JWST deep field bears important cosmological implication that favors high ${\sigma _8}$ of PLANCK cosmology over low-redshift probes.",
New submissions,Mixed Dark Matter and Galaxy Clustering: The Importance of Relative Perturbations,"Şafak Çelik,Fabian Schmidt",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We develop a perturbative model to describe large-scale structure in cosmologies where dark matter consists of a mixture of cold (CDM) and warm (WDM) components. In such mixed dark matter (MDM) scenarios, even a subdominant warm component can introduce distinctive signatures via its free-streaming effects, altering the evolution of density and velocity perturbations. We present linear-order solutions for both total and relative perturbations in the two-fluid system, identifying novel contributions to galaxy bias caused by the relative density and velocity modes between the components. Incorporating these effects into the galaxy bias expansion, we compute the linear galaxy power spectrum in both real and redshift space. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we assess the sensitivity of upcoming surveys such as DESI and PFS to MDM scenarios. Our results demonstrate that neglecting relative perturbations can lead to significant biases in inferred constraints on the warm dark matter fraction, particularly for lighter WDM masses ($\lesssim 150~\mathrm{eV}$ and $\lesssim 80~\mathrm{eV}$) for PFS and DESI, respectively. This framework provides a consistent and generalizable approach for incorporating multi-component dark matter dynamics into galaxy clustering analyses.",
New submissions,Hyper Suprime-Cam Y3 results: photo-$z$ bias calibration with lensing shear ratios and cosmological constraints from cosmic shea,"Divya Rana,Surhud More,Hironao Miyatake,Sunao Sugiyama,Tianqing Zhang,Masato Shirasaki",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present an independent calibration of the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) distributions for source galaxies in the HSC-Y3 weak lensing survey using small-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing. By measuring the tangential shear around spectroscopic lens galaxies from GAMA, SDSS, and DESI, divided into fifteen narrow redshift bins, we compute shear ratios that are sensitive to the mean redshift of source galaxies. Using a blinded analysis, we derive constraints on the photo-$z$ bias parameters in source bins 2, 3 and 4, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of 59, 75, and 62, respectively. Our constraints for $\Delta z_2$, $\Delta z_3$ and $\Delta z_4$ are consistent with those from HSC-Y3 cosmic shear modeling. We observe a mild shift in the $\Delta z_3$-$\Delta z_4$ plane due to the heterogeneous depth of the lens sample, which disappears when using only DESI-DR1 lenses. Combining shear-ratio measurements with cosmic shear data, we obtain joint constraints on cosmological parameters: $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.286_{-0.074}^{+0.038}$ and $S_8 = 0.760_{-0.145}^{+0.044}$, consistent with cosmic shear-only results. This work demonstrates the utility of small-scale lensing as an independent probe for calibrating photometric redshift bias in weak lensing cosmology.",
New submissions,Inferring local quasar IGM damping wing constraints,"Timo Kist,Joseph F. Hennawi,Frederick B. Davies",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wings towards quasars are a highly sensitive probe of the neutral hydrogen (HI) content in the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM), not only constraining the global timing of reionization but also the \textit{local} ionization topology near the quasar. Near-optimal extraction of this information is possible with the help of two recently introduced reionization model-independent summary statistics of the HI distribution in the IGM \textit{before} the quasar started shining, complemented with the quasar's lifetime encoding the effect of its ionizing radiation as a third parameter. We introduce a fully Bayesian JAX-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference framework that allows us to jointly reconstruct the quasar's unknown continuum and constrain these local damping wing statistics. We put forward a probabilistic framework that allows us to tie these local constraints to any specific reionization model and obtain model-dependent constraints on the global timing of reionization. We demonstrate that we are able to constrain the (Lorentzian-weighted) HI column density in front of the quasar to a precision of $0.69_{-0.30}^{+0.06}\,\mathrm{dex}$ and its original distance to the first neutral patch before the quasar started shining to $31.4_{-28.1}^{+10.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc}$ (if a noticeable damping wing is present in the spectrum), extracting hitherto unused local information from the IGM damping wing imprint. Once tied to a specific reionization model, we find that the statistical fidelity of our constraints on the global IGM neutral fraction and the lifetime of the quasar improves, while retaining the same precision as achieved by pipelines that infer these parameters directly.",

Jun,Yichen Liu,Jinyi Yang,Feige Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Thus far, Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wings towards quasars have been used to probe the \textit{global} ionization state of the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM). A new parameterization has demonstrated that the damping wing signature also carries \textit{local} information about the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) in front of the quasar before it started shining. Leveraging a recently introduced Bayesian \texttt{JAX}-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference framework, we derive constraints on the Lorentzian-weighted HI column density $N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW}$, the quasar's distance $r_\mathrm{patch}$ to the first neutral patch and its lifetime $t_\mathrm{Q}$ based on JWST/NIRSpec spectra of the two $z \sim 7.5$ quasars J1007+2115 and J1342+0928. After folding in model-dependent topology information, we find that J1007+2115 (and J1342+0928) is most likely to reside in a $\langle x_\mathrm{HI} \rangle = 0.32_{-0.20}^{+0.22}$ ($0.58_{-0.23}^{+0.23}$) neutral IGM while shining for a remarkably short lifetime of $\log_{10} t_\mathrm{Q} /\mathrm{yr} = 4.14_{-0.18}^{+0.74}$ (an intermediate lifetime of $5.64_{-0.43}^{+0.25}$) along a sightline with $\log_{10} N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW} /\mathrm{cm}^{-2} = 19.70_{-0.86}^{+0.35}$ ($20.24_{-0.22}^{+0.25}$) and $r_\mathrm{patch} = 28.9_{-14.4}^{+54.0} \,\mathrm{cMpc}$ ($10.9_{-5.9}^{+5.6} \,\mathrm{cMpc}$). In light of the potential presence of local absorbers in the foreground of J1342+0928 as has been recently suggested, we also demonstrate how the Lorentzian-weighted column density $N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW}$ provides a natural means for quantifying their contribution to the observed damping wing signal.",
Cross submissions,Interact or Twist: Cosmological Correlators from Field Redefinitions Revisited,"Donggang Wang,Xiangwei Wang,Yi Wang,Wenqi Yu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In cosmology, correlation functions on a late-time boundary can arise from both field redefinitions and bulk interactions, which are usually believed to generate distinct results. In this letter, we propose a counterexample showcasing that correlators from local field redefinitions can be identical to the ones from bulk interactions. In particular, we consider a two-field model in de Sitter space, where the field space gets twisted by field redefinitions to yield a nontrivial reheating surface. We then exploit conformal symmetry to compute the three-point function, and show that the result takes the form of contact correlators with a total-energy singularity. Our finding suggests that in the effective field theory, a class of lower-dimensional operators, which were overlooked previously, may lead to nontrivial signals in cosmological correlators. As an illustration, we apply our result to cosmic inflation and derive a possibly leading signature of the Higgs in the primordial bispectrum.",

In this work, we introduce a dark photon portal to the Standard Model in order to establish thermal equilibrium in the early Universe, and discuss the ensuing phenomenological constraints, including the stability of DM. The resulting dynamics accounts for the observed DM relic abundance and yields velocity-dependent DM self-interactions in astrophysical halos. Due to the sharp velocity dependence arising from a Breit-Wigner resonance, dedicated studies are required to assess the gravothermal evolution in detail, especially in the core-collapse regime. This is particularly timely in light of self-interacting DM interpretations of strong-lensing systems such as SDSS J0946+1006, which can be naturally explained within our framework.",

Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.",
