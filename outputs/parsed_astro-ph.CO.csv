New submissions,The isotropy of cosmic expansion in the early and late Universe,"Alan Junzhe Zhou,Scott Dodelson,Daniel Scolnic",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We test the isotropy of cosmic expansion by combining several probes for the first time, constructing full-sky maps of expansion rate variation using Type Ia supernovae, fundamental plane galaxies, and CMB temperature fluctuations. We find no hint of anisotropy or correlation between early- and late-Universe expansion across all systematic models. The 99% confidence upper limits on expansion rate anisotropy are 0.39% for low-redshift supernovae, 0.95% for high-redshift CMB, and 0.37% when combined at a 60-degree smoothing scale. A significant anomaly in the fundamental plane residual map may reflect systematics in the current DESI dataset, as evidenced by the absence of cross-correlation with other tracers and its correlation with spatial density variations.",
New submissions,Self-consistent population synthesis of AGN from observational constraints in the X-rays,"D. Gerolymatou,S. Paltani,C. Ricci,M. Regamey",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is produced by the emission of unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN), thus providing key information about the properties of the primary and reprocessed X-ray emission components of the AGN population. Equally important, studies of individual sources provide additional constraints on the properties of AGN, such as their luminosity and obscuration. Until now, these constraints have not been self-consistently addressed by intrinsically linking emission, absorption, and reflection. Here we perform numerical simulations with the ray-tracing code, RefleX, which allows us to self-consistently model the X-ray emission of AGN with flexible geometries for the circumnuclear medium. Using the RefleX-simulated emission of an AGN population, we attempt to simultaneously reproduce the CXB and absorption properties measured in the X-rays, namely the observed fraction of $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ in bins of log($N_{\mathrm{H}}$) and the fraction of absorbed AGN, including their redshift and luminosity evolution. We sample an intrinsic X-ray luminosity function and construct gradually more complex physically motivated geometrical models. We examine how well each model can match all observational constraints using a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach. We find that, while the simple unification model can reproduce the CXB, a luminosity dependent dusty torus is needed to reproduce the absorption properties. When adding an accretion disc, the model best matches all constraints simultaneously. Our synthetic population is able to reproduce the dependence of the covering factor on luminosity, the AGN number counts from several surveys, and the observed correlation between reflection and obscuration. Finally, we derive an intrinsic Compton-thick fraction of 21$\pm$7%, consistent with local observations.",
New submissions,Overmassive Black holes live in compact galaxies in the early Universe,"Yuxuan Wu,Tao Wang,Daizhong Liu,Qinghua Tan,Luis C. Ho,Zhiyu Zhang,Yong Shi,Ke Xu,Kotaro Kohno,Ran Wang,Takuma Izumi,Zhaozhou Li",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A significant population of quasars have been found to exist within the first Gyr of cosmic time. Most of them have high black hole (BH) masses ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8-10} M_{\odot}$) with an elevated BH-to-stellar mass ratio compared to typical local galaxies, posing challenges to our understanding of the formation of supermassive BHs and their coevolution with host galaxies. Here, based on size measurements of [CII] 158$\mu$m emission for a statistical sample of $z \sim 6$ quasars, we find that their host galaxies are systematically more compact (with half-light radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 1.6$ kpc) than typical star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. Specifically, the sizes of the most compact quasar hosts, which also tend to contain less cold gas than their more extended counterparts, are comparable to that of massive quiescent galaxies at $z \sim 4-5$. These findings reveal an intimate connection between the formation of massive BHs and compactness of their host galaxies in the early universe. These compact quasar hosts are promising progenitors of the first population of quiescent galaxies.",
New submissions,Self-Interacting Dark Matter with Mass Segregation: A Unified Explanation of Dwarf Cores and Small-Scale Lenses,"Daneng Yang,Yi-Zhong Fan,Siyuan Hou,Yue-Lin Sming Tsai",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"In two-component SIDM models with inter-species interactions, mass segregation arises naturally from collisional relaxation, enhancing central densities and gravothermal evolution without requiring large cross sections. We propose a model with velocity-dependent interactions, both within and between species, that connects observations across several halo mass scales while remaining consistent with cluster-scale constraints. This combination enables modest mass segregation in low-mass and typical-concentration halos, consistent with recent dwarf galaxy clustering measurements. Using cosmological zoom-in simulations and controlled isolated halo studies, we show that this model produces dwarf galaxy cores that grow over time, explains the structure of dark perturbers observed in strong lensing systems, and significantly increases the number and efficiency of small-scale lenses, consistent with the galaxy-galaxy strong lensing excess reported in clusters. Our results establish mass segregation in two-component SIDM as a self-consistent and testable model capable of simultaneously addressing multiple small-scale challenges in structure formation.",
New submissions,Detection of pure warm-hot intergalactic medium emission from a $7.2$ Mpc long filament in the Shapley supercluster using X-ray spectroscopy,"Konstantinos Migkas,Florian Pacaud,Toni Tuominen,Nabila Aghanim",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"A significant fraction of the local Universe's baryonic content remains undetected. Cosmological simulations indicate that most of the missing baryons reside in cosmic filaments in the form of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). The latter shows low surface brightness and soft X-ray emission, making it challenging to detect. Until now, X-ray WHIM emission has been detected only in very few individual filaments, whereas in even fewer filaments, WHIM has been spectroscopically analyzed. In this work, we used four Suzaku pointings to study the WHIM emission of a filament in the Shapley supercluster, connecting the galaxy cluster pairs A3530/32 and A3528-N/S. We additionally employ XMM-Newton observations to robustly account for point sources in the filament and to fully characterize the neighboring clusters and their signal contamination to the filament region. We report the direct imaging and spectroscopic detection of extended thermal WHIM emission from this single filament. Our imaging analysis confirms the existence of $(21\pm 3)\% $ excess X-ray emission throughout the filament compared to the sky background at a $6.1\sigma$ level. We constrain the filament gas temperature, electron density, and baryon overdensity to be $k_{\text{B}}T\approx (0.8-1.1)$ keV, $n_{\text{e}}\approx 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and $\delta_{\text{b}}\approx (30-40)$, respectively, at a $>3\sigma$ detection level, in agreement with cosmological simulations for the first time for a single filament. Independent of the X-ray analysis, we also identify a spectroscopic galaxy overdensity throughout the filament using the Shapley Supercluster velocity Database and constrain the filament's 3D length to be 7.2 Mpc. Overall, this is the first X-ray spectroscopic detection of pure WHIM emission from an individual, pristine filament without significant contamination from unresolved point sources and gas clumps.",
New submissions,Revealing Limitation in the Standard Cosmological Model: A Redshift-Dependent Hubble Constant from Fast Radio Bursts,"Surajit Kalita(Warsaw),Akhil Uniyal(TDLI),Tomasz Bulik(Warsaw),Yosuke Mizuno(TDLI)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$, which contradicts the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.",
New submissions,Extended datasamples under the lens of Brane World Theory,"Kyra Jacobo,Dorian Araya",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work revises the Brane World Theory known as Randall-Sundrum with the modification of an exponential, redshift-dependent brane tension. This model is studied in a scenario assuming no dark energy, with the aim of determining whether it can reproduce the universe's acceleration on its own, without the addition of a dark energy fluid. Bayesian statistical analysis is performed in order to constrain the free parameters of each scenario using SLS, SNIa, OHD, and BAO data samples, the last two considering newly added data points. Both Planck and Riess priors for h are used and compared. In both cases, we are able to reproduce the late-time accelerated expansion in agreement with observational data. Interesting consistencies at the transition redshift zt with LCDM are found, suggesting that this might be a suitable model for studying the evolution of the universe up to the present date. However, some pathologies are detected in this model, namely a ""Big Rip"" divergence of H(z) at z = 1, as well as a strong dependence between the functional form of the brane tension and the future evolution of the universe.",
New submissions,GalaxyGenius: A Mock Galaxy Image Generator for Various Telescopes from Hydrodynamical Simulations,"Xingchen Zhou,Hang Yang,Nan Li,Qi Xiong,Furen Deng,Xian-Min Meng,Renhao Ye,Shiyin Shen,Peng Wei,Qifan Cui,Zizhao He,Ayodeji Ibitoye,Chengliang Wei,Yuedong Fang",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"To advance research on galaxies in the era of large-scale sky surveys, we introduce GalaxyGenius, a Python package designed to produce synthetic galaxy images tailored to different telescopes based on hydrodynamical simulations. The package comprises three main modules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube generation, and mock observation. Specifically, the preprocessing module extracts necessary properties of star and gas particles for a selected subhalo from hydrodynamical simulations and creates the execution file for the following radiative transfer procedure. Subsequently, building on the above information, the ideal data cube generation module executes a widely-used radiative transfer project, specifically the SKIRT, to perform the SED assignment for each particle and the radiative transfer procedure to produce an IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock observation module takes the ideal data cube and applies the throughputs of aiming telescopes while also incorporating the relevant instrumental effects, point spread functions (PSFs), and background noise to generate desired mock observational images of galaxies. To showcase the outcomes of GalaxyGenius, We create a series of mock images of galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and ground-based surveys spanning from the ultraviolet to infrared wavelength coverages, including CSST, Euclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius offers a flexible framework developed to generate mock galaxy images with customizable recipes. These generated images can serve as valuable references for verifying and validating new approaches in astronomical research, and they can also act as training sets for deep learning relevant studies where real observational data are insufficient.",
New submissions,Soft X-ray line emission from hot gas in intervening galaxy halos and diffuse gas in the cosmic web,"Yuning Zhang,Dandan Xu,Chengzhe Li,Wei Cui",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Cosmic hot gas emission is closely related to halo gas acquisition and galactic feedback processes. Their X-ray observations reveal important physical properties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However, the measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always include contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the target. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via different strategies. In this work, we aim at answering an interesting theoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from intervening hot gases of different origins. We tackle this problem with the aid of the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field lightcone and estimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting galaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the intervening hot gases into three categories, that is, the hot gas that is gravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the diffuse gas which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web structures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that permeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line emissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray band can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound to intervening galaxy halos. While the hot gas emission from the quiescent galaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along the line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as measured in the energy band of 0.4--0.85 keV can reach ~20--200 % of the emission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.",
New submissions,EMUSE: Evolutionary Map of the Universe Search Engine,"Nikhel Gupta,Zeeshan Hayder,Minh Huynh,Ray P. Norris,Lars Petersson,Andrew M. Hopkins,Simone Riggi,Bärbel S. Koribalski,Miroslav D. Filipović",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present EMUSE (Evolutionary Map of the Universe Search Engine), a tool designed for searching specific radio sources within the extensive datasets of the EMU (Evolutionary Map of the Universe) survey, with potential applications to other Big Data challenges in astronomy. Built on a multimodal approach to radio source classification and retrieval, EMUSE fine-tunes the OpenCLIP model on curated radio galaxy datasets. Leveraging the power of foundation models, our work integrates visual and textual embeddings to enable efficient and flexible searches within large radio astronomical datasets. We fine-tune OpenCLIP using a dataset of 2,900 radio galaxies, encompassing various morphological classes, including FR-I, FR-II, FR-x, R-type, and other rare and peculiar sources. The model is optimized using adapter-based fine-tuning, ensuring computational efficiency while capturing the unique characteristics of radio sources. The fine-tuned model is then deployed in EMUSE, allowing for seamless image- and text-based queries over the EMU survey dataset. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in retrieving and classifying radio sources, particularly in recognizing distinct morphological features. However, challenges remain in identifying rare or previously unseen radio sources, highlighting the need for expanded datasets and continuous refinement. This study showcases the potential of multimodal machine learning in radio astronomy, paving the way for more scalable and accurate search tools in the field. The search engine is accessible atthis https URLand can be used locally by cloning the repository atthis https URL.",
New submissions,Could We Be Fooled about Phantom Crossing?,"Ryan E. Keeley,Arman Shafieloo,William L. Matthewson",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent data from DESI Year 2 BAO, Planck CMB, and various supernova compilations suggest a preference for evolving dark energy, with hints that the equation of state may cross the phantom divide line ($w = -1$). While this behavior is seen in both parametric and non-parametric reconstructions, comparing reconstructions that support such behavior (such as the best fit of CPL) with those that maintain $w>-1$ (like the best fit algebraic quintessence) is not straightforward, as they differ in flexibility and structure, and are not necessarily nested within one another. Thus, the question remains as to whether the crossing behavior that we observe, suggested by the data, truly represents a dark energy model that crosses the phantom divide line, or if it could instead be a result of data fluctuations and the way the data are distributed. We investigate the likelihood of this possibility. For this analysis we perform 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations based on a fiducial algebraic quintessence model. We find that in $3.2 \% $ of cases, CPL with phantom crossing not only fits better, but exceeds the real-data $\chi^2$ improvement. This Monte Carlo approach quantifies to what extent statistical fluctuations and the specific distribution of the data could fool us into thinking the phantom divide line is crossed, when it is not. Although evolving dark energy remains a robust signal, and crossing $w=-1$ a viable phenomenological solution that seems to be preferred by the data, its precise behavior requires deeper investigation with more precise data.",
New submissions,The effects of continuum fitting on Lyman-$α$ forest correlations,"Nicolas Busca,James Rich,Julian Bautista,Andrei Cuceu,Andreu Font-Ribera,Julien Guy,Hiram K.

Sanchez,D. Schlegel,H. Seo,J. Silber,D. Sprayberry,G. Tarlé,B. A. Weaver,R. Zhou,H. Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Correlations of fluctuations of the flux in Lyman-$\alpha$ forests of high-redshift quasars have been observed by the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation Spectroscopy Survey (BOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI) survey where they have revealed the effects of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). In order to fit the correlation functions to a physical model and thereby constrain cosmological parameters, it is necessary to take into account the effects of fitting the observed spectra to a template about which the fluctuations are measured. In this paper we use mock spectra to test the distortion matrix technique that has been used since the final BOSS data release to appropriately distort the models. We show that while percent-level effects on the derived forest bias parameters may be present, the technique works sufficiently well that the determination of the BAO peak position is not affected at the percent level. We introduce modifications in the technique used by DESI that were not in the original applications and suggest further possibilities for improvements.",
New submissions,Unveiling the small-scale web around galaxies with miniJPAS and DESI: the role of local connectivity in star formation,"Daniela Galárraga-Espinosa,Guinevere Kauffmann,Silvia Bonoli,Luisa Lucie-Smith,Rosa M.

Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is channeled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct observational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of mapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data combined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a high-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2<z<0.8. Local filaments are detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M* $> 10^9$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$, using other nearby galaxies as tracers and a probabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm, designed to overcome limitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is tested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models and reference lightcone simulations. We recover the expected increase in galaxy connectivity, defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy, with stellar mass. Interestingly, we find a persistent correlation between connectivity and star formation in medium mass galaxies (M* $= 10^{10-11}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$) in the low redshift bins. These results are consistent with the cosmic web detachment scenario, suggesting that reduced connectivity to local filaments hinders the inflow of star-forming material. We propose galaxy connectivity to local (small-scale) filaments as a powerful and physically motivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic structure in galaxy evolution.",
New submissions,What new physics can we extract from inflation using the ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 Observations?,"Sayantan Choudhury,Bauyrzhan Gulnur,Swapnil Kumar Singh,Koblandy Yerzanov",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.",
New submissions,Cosmic curl -- Features and convergence of the vorticity power spectrum in $N$-body simulations,"Camilla T. G. Sørensen,Steen Hannestad,Thomas Tram",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Observations of the cosmic velocity field could become an important cosmological probe in the near future. To take advantage of future velocity-flow surveys we must however have the theoretical predictions under control. In many respects, the velocity field is easier to simulate than the density field because it is less severely affected by small-scale clustering. Therefore, as we also show in this paper, a particle-mesh (PM) based simulation approach is usually sufficient, yielding results within a few percent of a corresponding P$^3$M simulation in which short-range forces are properly accounted for, but which also carry a much larger computational cost.However, in other respects the velocity field is much more challenging to deal with than the density field: Interpolating the velocity field onto a grid is significantly more complicated, and the vorticity field (the curl-part of the velocity field) is severely affected by both sample variance and discretisation effects. While the former can be dealt with using fixed amplitude initial conditions, the former makes it infeasible to run fully converged simulations in a cosmological volume. However, using the $N$-body code CONCEPT we show that one can robustly extrapolate the cosmic vorticity power spectrum from just 4 simulations with different number of particles. We expect our extrapolated vorticity power spectra to be correct within 5\% of the fully converged result across three orders of magnitude in $k$.",
Cross submissions,Micro Black Hole Dark Matter,"Manuel Ettengruber,Florian Kuhnel",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The influence of a possible low gravity scale, concretely through the presence of extra dimensions or additional species, on radiation properties of micro black holes is investigated. In particular, the suppression of evaporation through the so-called memory-burden effect is shown to be stronger, occurs earlier and with sharper transition compared to the canonical Planck-scale regime. It is furthermore shown how this affects the possibility of light primordial black hole dark matter, constraints on which may weaken substantially and allow them to be as light as $10^{-5}\,M_{\rm P}$, thereby lying in the particle regime.",
Cross submissions,Primordial Black Holes are 5D,"Luis A. Anchordoqui,Alek Bedroya,Dieter Lüst",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We revisit well-established mechanisms for primordial black hole (PBH) production, namely inflation, phase transitions, and cosmic strings, in the context of the Dark Dimension Scenario, which is motivated by Swampland principles. Applying quantum gravity constraints, we demonstrate that any viable mechanism, barring exotic new physics at low energies, inevitably leads to the formation of five-dimensional PBHs. We further show that PBHs formed from cosmic strings can have lifetimes comparable to the age of the universe. We comment on the observational implications of this result, including a potential connection to the recent detection of a high-energy neutrino by KM3NeT, whose energy is intriguingly close to the five-dimensional Planck scale in the Dark Dimension Scenario.",
Cross submissions,The Cosmological Constant from a Quantum Gravitational $θ$-Vacua and the Gravitational Hall Effect,"Stephon Alexander,Heliudson Bernardo,Aaron Hui",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We provide a new perspective on the cosmological constant by exploring the background-independent Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of general relativity. The Chern-Simons-Kodama state of quantum gravity, a generalization of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin states, has a striking structural similarity to the topological field theory of the quantum Hall effect. As a result, we study the gravitational topological $\theta$-sectors in analogy to Yang-Mills theory. We find that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is intimately linked to the $\theta$-parameter by $\theta=12\pi^2/(\Lambda \ell^2_{\rm Pl}) \mod 2\pi$ due to the fact that Chern-Simons-Kodama state must live in a particular $\theta$-sector. This result is shown in the canonical, non-perturbative formalism. Furthermore, we explain how the physics of the Hamiltonian constraint is analogous to the quantum Hall effect, with the cosmological constant playing the role of a quantum gravitational Hall resistivity. These relations suggest that $\Lambda$ is topologically protected against perturbative graviton loop corrections, analogous to the robustness of quantized Hall conductance against disorder in a metal.",
Cross submissions,"Can weak-gravity, causality-violation arguments constrain modified gravity?","Stephon Alexander,Heliudson Bernardo,Nicolás Yunes",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate limitations of causality arguments from flat-spacetime amplitudes, based on the eikonal limit of gravitational scattering, to place constraints on modified gravity. We show that causality constraints are only valid in the weak-gravity regime even for transplanckian scattering, and that such constraints are much less stringent than astrophysical ones, obtained for example from gravitational waves emitted in black hole coalescence. Special attention is given to the weakness of causality constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, but our results apply to other modified gravity theories as well. In the context of that theory, we also discuss how to obtain a time-delay formula from black hole, neutron stars, and shockwave solutions. For scattering with compact objects, we explicitly show that time delays are greatly suppressed by the ratio of the object's mass to the impact parameter, so time advances only occur greatly outside the cut off of the theory. For the shockwave solution, we find that the time delay is always positive within the regime of validity of the solution. We also comment on the impact of graviton nonlinearities for time-delay calculations in the nonlinear, strong gravity regime. We conclude that amplitude-based causality constraints on modified gravity are typically not stringent relative to other experimental and observational bounds.",
