New submissions,"Viability of generalized $Î±$-inflation from Planck, ACT, and DESI Data","Gabriel German,Juan Carlos Hidalgo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study two classes of single-field inflationary models - a generalization of the alpha-attractor and the alpha-Starobinsky model - and examine their compatibility with current observational data from Planck, ACT DR6, and BAO measurements from DESI DR2. Our analysis focuses on the reheating phase that follows inflation, characterized by the equation-of-state parameter omega_re, the reheating temperature T_re, and the number of e-folds N_re. We use a semi-analytical approach based on an equation linking inflationary dynamics to reheating, allowing us to compute the inflaton value at horizon crossing phi_k and other related cosmological quantities. We consider different decay channels for the inflaton: gravitational, Yukawa, and scalar. We are particularly interested in studying these models in the r-n_s and T_re-n_s planes, especially in regions close to the P-ACT-LB2 combination, which is the area most distant from the Planck data. To do this, we explore a wide range of values for the model parameters and show the graphs where the closest approximation to the P-ACT-LB2 region occurs. Other authors have already carried out related work; where there is overlap, our results are consistent with those obtained by other means.",
New submissions,Energy-dependent anisotropy of cosmic-ray muons: A twelve-year study with IceCube Neutrino Observatory,"Nabin Upadhya Dhakal,Nabin Bhusal,Manjeet Kunwar,Manil Khatiwada,Shiv Narayan Yadav",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a comprehensive, energy-resolved study of cosmic-ray muon anisotropy using 12 years (2011-2023) of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, comprising 7.92 x 10^11 events in the 13 TeV to 5.3 PeV energy range. Dividing the spectrum at log-scale energy 5 GeV, we contrast low- and high-energy anisotropy features via sidereal modulation, angular profiles, Fourier analysis, and full-sky HEALPix mapping. Gaussian and power-law fits to energy distributions are evaluated using chi-squared, reduced chi-squared, and Bayesian Information Criterion. Results show strong dipolar and large-scale anisotropy at low energies, likely due to geomagnetic and atmospheric effects, while high-energy muons display weaker, more localized structures consistent with reduced scattering and source-related anisotropy. Energy distributions are well fit by Gaussians, especially in the 6.5 to 100 bin, validating IceCube's reconstruction at PeV scales. These findings confirm energy-dependent anisotropy and support cosmic-ray diffusion models.",
New submissions,"Cosmological Constraints on $f(T,B)$ Gravity from Observations of Early and Late Universe","Yahia Al-Omar,Majida Nahili,Nidal Chamoun,Marwan Al-Raeei",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study proposes a unified framework comprising two complementary approaches to constrain three functional forms of $f(T,B)$ gravity, namely the linear, quadratic, and general power law models, by jointly utilizing early and late Universe observations. First, we impose bounds on deviations in the weak interaction freeze-out temperature, informed by the latest measurements of the primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we incorporate direct Hubble parameter data, $H(\mathcal{z})$, obtained from Cosmic Chronometers in the redshift range $0.07\le\mathcal{z}\le2.0$, to trace the expansion history of the Universe. By minimizing a combined chi-square statistic across both datasets, we derive the best-fit values and confidence intervals for each model parameter. The joint analysis significantly refines the parameter constraints compared to methods based solely on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, thereby offering a more robust test of $f(T,B)$ gravity across cosmic epochs. The results support the viability of torsion-based modifications to General Relativity and provide a consistent methodology for future evaluation using upcoming observational data.",
New submissions,Resolving the Planck-DESI tension by non-minimally coupled quintessence,"Jia-Qi Wang,Rong-Gen Cai,Zong-Kuan Guo,Shao-Jiang Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The Planck measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between DESI-$\Lambda$CDM and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we will illustrate with a string-theory-motivated model that, when the DM non-minimally couples to gravity via a quintessence field, a misidentification with the $w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, while the coupled quintessence never crosses $w=-1$ but behaves as a standard CDM in the early Universe and approaches a cosmological constant in the late Universe. Such a non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. The worsened $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension and $S_8$ tension in the $w_0w_a$CDM model are also resolved in our model.",
New submissions,$\texttt{GENGARS}$: Accurate non-Gaussian initial conditions with arbitrary bispectrum for N-body simulations,"Emanuele Fondi,Licia Verde,Marco Baldi,William Coulton,Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro,Benjamin Dan Wandelt",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Primordial non-Gaussianity is predicted by various inflationary models, and N-body simulations are a crucial tool for studying its imprints on large-scale structure. In this work, we present \texttt{GENGARS} ( GEnerator of Non-Gaussian ARbitrary Shapes), a framework for generating accurate non-Gaussian initial conditions for N-body simulations. It builds upon the formulation introduced by Wagner \& Verde (2012), enabling to generate a primordial gravitational potential with a desired separable bispectrum $B_{\Phi}(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. For the local, equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussian templates, we benchmark our method against the well-established \texttt{2LPT-PNG} code. We show that \texttt{GENGARS} achieves improved accuracy and lower noise by suppressing spurious contributions to the primordial power spectrum. This paper aims at presenting the method, quantifying its performance and illustrating the benefits and applicable use cases over existing approaches.",
New submissions,Clustering of Primordial Black Holes in Excursion Set Theory,"Hamed Kameli,Encieh Erfani",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate the clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) within the framework of Excursion Set Theory (EST). The EST formalism is extended to compute the joint probability of forming PBH pairs within a clustering distance, based on two stochastic trajectories with a shared history. Our results show that an enhanced power spectrum not only increases the formation of PBHs in specific mass ranges but also enhances their clustering probability. We find a one-to-one correspondence between the blue-tilted spectral index and the mass ranges in which PBHs form and cluster. Additionally, we demonstrate that the clustering probability decreases asymptotically with increasing clustering distance, while a higher critical density threshold (barrier) leads to a suppression of clustering abundance.",
New submissions,Wiener filtering and multi-tracer techniques for dark matter cross-correlations between gamma-ray emission and galaxy catalogs,"Andrea Rubiola,Stefano Camera,Nicolao Fornengo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Cross-correlations between a gravitational tracer of dark matter and the contribution to the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) from the radiation produced by the annihilation of the particles responsible for the dark matter, have been established as a powerful tool to investigate the particle physics nature of dark matter. Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs, cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of 5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the best option for heavier dark matter.",
New submissions,New Radio Data on Sources of the Big Trio Program for Searching for Distant Radio Galaxies,"Olga Zhelenkova,Adelina Temirova,Yurij Parijskij,Natalia Soboleva",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A sample of objects with steep and ultra-steep spectra was prepared from radio sources of the Cold experiment surveys conducted on the RATAN-600 radio telescope. It formed the basis for the Big Trio program for searching for distant radio galaxies. With the advent of high-sensitivity, high-angular-resolution radio sky surveys, as well as deep optical and infrared surveys, it became possible to conduct additional studies of the sample. We refined the morphology and spectra of continuous radio emissions from radio galaxies.A detailed study of the morphological features of the sample sources revealed that 4 of the sample sources are formed by close radio sources with a distance of about 60 kpc between the parent galaxies. 8% of the radio sources demonstrate a restart of activity in the radio range, 20% of the sources are in an environment that leads to the deformation of the lobes, 11% are young sources and 2% are fading.A high percentage of sources with a variability index greater than 3 is associated with a large difference in the angular resolution of the compared TXS and VCSS surveys, as well as an underestimated flux density for some double sources in the latter survey. Comparison of spectral indices obtained from old and new data showed that in the studied sample the share of sources with steep spectra has significantly decreased. Most likely, this is due to the addition of low-frequency GLEAM data, although for some radio sources a possible evolution of the continuum spectrum over an interval of several decades is not excluded -- a shift towards low frequencies.",
New submissions,Higher order methods for Radiative Transfer in Astrophysical simulations: $\rm P_n$ vs $\rm M_1$,"Mei Palanque,Pierre Ocvirk,Emmanuel Franck,Pierre Gerhard,Dominique Aubert,Olivier Marchal",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In current cosmological simulations, the radiative transfer modules generally rely on the M_1 approximation, which has some glaring flaws related to its fluid-like behaviour, such as spurious pseudo-sources and loss of directionality when radiation fronts from different directions collide. P_n, another moment-based model used in other fields of physics, may correct these issues. We aim at testing out P_n in an astrophysical setting and compare it to M_1, in order to see if it can indeed correct M_1's flaws. Also, we want to use P_n's solutions to better pinpoint M_1 errors. We implement a P_n radiation transport method and couple it to a photo-thermo-chemistry module to account for the interaction of ionising radiation with the Hydrogen gas, and benchmark it using tests for radiative transfer models comparison in astrophysics as defined inarXiv:astro-ph/0603199. We find that high order P_n (e.g. P_9) indeed correct M_1's flaws, while faring as well or even better in some aspects in the tests, in particular when directionality is important or colliding radiation fronts occur. By comparing P_9 and M_1 radiation fields in an idealised and cosmological test case, we highlight a new, thus far unreported artefact of M_1, the 'dark sombrero'. A dark sombrero appears as a spherical photon-deficit shell around the source. The photon density in dark sombreros can be underestimated by a factor up to 2-3. They occur in regions where a source's radiation field connects with that of another source or group of sources. These basic properties (position and amplitude) of the dark sombreros may depend on the sources' relative intensities, positions, spatial resolution, although we have not been able to test this in detail in this study.",
New submissions,EDGES-3: Instrument Design and Commissioning,"Rigel C. Cappallo,Alan E. E. Rogers,Colin J. Lonsdale,Judd D. Bowman,John P. Barrett,Steven G. Murray,Nivedita Mahesh,Peter Sims,Akshatha K. Vydula,Raul A. Monsalve,Christopher J. Eckert,Parker Steen,Kenneth M. Wilson",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"EDGES-3 is the third iteration of the EDGES experiment, designed to measure the predicted global absorption feature in the radio spectrum produced by neutral hydrogen gas at cosmic dawn, a critical observation determining when and how the first stars populated the universe. The EDGES-3 instrument has been redesigned to include both the analog and digital electronics within the antenna, allowing for in-situ calibration and removal of the lossy balun found in EDGES-2. EDGES-3 has been on multiple deployments in the past 4 years; to Oregon, Devon Island, Adak Island, and is currently installed and taking data in the outback of Western Australia. This paper provides an accounting of the challenges inherent in the detection of the global, cosmological 21-cm signal, the strategies EDGES employs to mitigate each of these challenges, a description of the instrument, and a report on the Western Australia deployment along with observational data.",
New submissions,Testing Dark Matter with Generative Models for Extragalactic Stellar Streams,"Jacob Nibauer,Sarah Pearson",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Upcoming ground and space-based surveys are poised to illuminate low surface brightness tidal features, providing a new observable connection to dark matter physics. From imaging of tidal debris, the morphology of stellar streams can be used to infer the geometry of dark matter halos. In this paper, we develop a generative approach, X-Stream, which translates stream imaging into constraints on the radial density profile of dark matter halos--from the inner region out to the virial radius. Using the GPU-accelerated code streamsculptor, we generate thousands of stream realizations in trial gravitational potentials and apply nested sampling with a custom objective function to explore viable regions of parameter space. We find that multiple stellar streams can be used to constrain the entire radial density profile of a halo, including both its inner and outer density slopes. These constraints provide a test for alternatives to cold dark matter, such as self-interacting dark matter, which predicts cored density profiles. From cosmological simulations, the outer density slope is expected to correlate with merger histories though remains underexplored observationally. With ongoing and upcoming missions such as Euclid, the Rubin Observatory, ARRAKIHS, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, X-Stream will enable detailed mapping of dark matter for thousands of galaxies across a wide range of redshifts and halo masses.",
Cross submissions,(Non-)Perturbative Dynamics of a Light QCD Axion: Dark Matter and the Strong CP Problem,"Raymond T. Co,Taegyu Lee,Owen P. Leonard",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Considerable theoretical efforts have gone into expanding the reach of the QCD axion beyond its canonical mass--decay-constant relation. The $Z_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion model reduces the QCD axion mass naturally, by invoking a discrete $Z_\mathcal{N}$ symmetry through which the axion field is coupled to $\mathcal{N}$ copies of the Standard Model. Before the QCD phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm QCD}$, the $Z_\mathcal{N}$ potential has a minimum at misalignment angle $\theta=\pi$. At $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta =\pi$ becomes a maximum; the axion potential becomes exponentially suppressed and develops $\mathcal{N}$ minima -- only one of which actually solves the strong CP problem. Before $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta$ relaxes towards $\pi$. After $T_{\rm QCD}$, the axion field starts from around the hilltop and may have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the newly suppressed potential barriers. Such a field evolution leads to nonlinear effects via the self-interactions near the hilltop, which can cause the exponential growth of fluctuations and backreaction on the coherent motion. This behavior can influence the relic density of the field and the minimum in which it settles. We conduct the first lattice simulations of the $Z_{\mathcal{N}}$ QCD axion using ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice to accurately calculate dark matter abundances and find nonlinear dynamics reduce the abundance by up to a factor of two. We furthermore find that the probability of solving the strong CP problem tends to diverge considerably from the naive expectation of $1/\mathcal{N}$.",
Cross submissions,A General Model for Dark Energy Crossing the Phantom Divide,"Zhibang Yao,Gen Ye,Alessandra Silvestri",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Within the framework of spatially covariant theories, we propose a general model for dark energy (DE) in which the cosmological background and perturbations are independently controlled by different sets of coefficients, and the equation of state of DE is directly determined by two free functions of time from the Lagrangian. These properties allow to realize arbitrary background evolutions while avoiding ghost and gradient instabilities in linear perturbations. They also enable a more direct analysis of phantom crossing without having to first solve the background equations of motion. In this model, the sound speed of the scalar mode is scale-dependent and approaches infinity at large scale, so that the field becomes non-dynamical in the infrared (IR) limit. Even though this usually indicates a strong coupling issue, we speculate that this is avoided because the scalar degree of freedom becomes frozen not only at linear order but also at any higher order in IR limit. Given this characteristic large scales behavior, we dub the model \emph{Freezing Gravity}. On smaller scales, the scalar mode propagates with a finite speed of sound. The theory has a cut-off in energy, signaled by the pole in the speed of sound, when the effective Planck mass exceeds Planck mass.",
Cross submissions,Geometric multipartite entanglement from gravitational particle production,"Alessio Belfiglio,Roberto Franzosi,Orlando Luongo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore novel generation of genuine multipartite entanglement within gravitational particle production processes during inflationary stages. To this end, we focus on perturbative production mechanisms, considering a non-minimally coupled scalar inflaton field with quartic self-coupling potential and computing probability amplitudes arising from its gravitational interaction with background perturbations. The corresponding entanglement amount is quantified using the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, that provides a \emph{geometric interpretation of particle entanglement, in terms of the Fubini-Study metric}. We observe that, in the limit of negligible squeezing, the total amount of entanglement is dominated by the infrared cutoff scale, in agreement with previous studies analyzing the von Neumann entropy within bipartite scenarios. We then show that \emph{non-negligible multipartite entanglement signatures may emerge across inflation, even during the latest stages of slow-roll}, highlighting their dependence on inflationary momentum scales. Generalizations to regimes with non-negligible squeezing, cubic non-Gaussianities, additional spectator fields and possible observational signatures are also discussed.",
Cross submissions,Revisiting Polynomial Hybrid Inflation: Planck and ACT Compatibility via Radiative Corrections,"Waqas Ahmed,Saleh O. Allehabi,Mansoor Ur Rehman",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the impact of one-loop radiative corrections in a non-supersymmetric model of hybrid inflation with a chaotic (polynomial-like) potential,$V(\phi) = V_0 + \lambda_p \phi^p$, in the light of the latest constraints from \textit{Planck} and \textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope} (ACT) observations. Here, $V_0$ denotes the energy scale of inflation, and $\lambda_p$ is a coupling associated with the polynomial term of power $p$. These corrections can naturally arise from couplings of the inflaton to other matter fields, which also facilitate the reheating process. At the tree level, the predictions of such models for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ typically lie outside the current observational bounds. However, incorporating one-loop radiative corrections modifies the potential to, \[ V(\phi) = V_0 + \lambda_p \phi^p + A \phi^4 \ln (\phi/ \mu), \] where $A$ characterizes the strength of the inflaton's coupling to other fields, and \(\mu\) is an appropriate renormalization scale. This radiatively corrected potential can reconcile the model with the combined \textit{Planck}+ACT data over a suitable range of parameter space explored in this work. In particular, radiative corrections from fermionic loops ($A < 0$) suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, while simultaneously yielding a red-tilted spectrum with $n_s < 1$, even for sub-Planckian field excursions. This brings the prediction in line with current observations, while still allowing for potentially detectable signatures of primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, the inflaton's couplings enable successful reheating and naturally accommodate non-thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified framework for inflation and baryogenesis.",
Cross submissions,Lepton parity dark matter and naturally unstable domain walls,"Ernest Ma,Partha Kumar Paul,Narendra Sahu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a simple and predictive setup that connects neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and gravitational waves. A minimal lepton parity DM scenario is considered where the residual symmetry $(-1)^L$ from the type I seesaw acts as the dark parity $D=(-1)^{L+2j}$, ensuring DM stability without imposing any new symmetry. A singlet Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity serves as the DM candidate, interacting via a real scalar $\sigma$ which is also even lepton parity. The scalar potential possesses an accidental $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, whose spontaneous breaking gives rise to unstable domain walls (DW) in the presence of explicit $\mathcal{Z}_2$ breaking terms allowed by the lepton parity. The subsequent DW annihilation generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background potentially observable at different GW experiments.",
