New submissions,Symmetry-protected conservation of superhorizon inflationary perturbations to all loops,"Cheng-Jun Fang,Zhen-Hong Lyu,Chao Chen,Zong-Kuan Guo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We demonstrates that the single-field inflation field system exhibits a symmetry that constrains its evolution via the Ward identity even for non-attractor inflation. By analyzing loop diagram structures, we derive a superhorizon conserved quantity directly related to the two-point correlation function of curvature perturbations, generalizing previous one-loop results to arbitrary loop orders. This symmetry-based approach provides a framework for understanding quantum conservation laws beyond the leading perturbative order.",
New submissions,Constraining the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster Abell 2142 using MeerKAT L-band polarisation data,"A. Pagliotta,C. J. Riseley,A. Bonafede,C. Stuardi,F. Loi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Magnetic fields permeate the Universe, including galaxy clusters, and affect the thermodynamical properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that seed magnetic fields are amplified up to the $\mu$G-level in the ICM, but the magnetic field strength and structure have been studied in only a few clusters. Abell 2142 is a local massive cluster that shows evidence of a post-merger dynamical state. In this work, we aim to constrain the magnetic field intensity, radial profile and power spectrum within its ICM, providing key insights into the nature of this non-thermal component in galaxy clusters. We present MeerKAT observations of Abell 2142 in the L-band (872-1712 MHz), imaged in polarisation for the first time with this purpose. We derive the Rotation Measure (RM) from the radio galaxies' polarised emission by applying the RM synthesis technique and analyse both the RM and fractional polarisation ($\mathrm{F_p}$). To investigate the magnetic field distribution within the ICM, we compare our results with mock RM maps generated from 3D simulations of the cluster. We find that the RM dispersion, $\sigma_{\mathrm{RM}}$, decreases with projected radius, whereas the $\mathrm{F_p}$ increases. Both trends suggest that the magnetic field intensity decreases at larger distances from the cluster center, in agreement with studies on other clusters. Assuming that the magnetic field energy density scales with the gas thermal energy ($B \propto n_e^{0.5}$), a magnetic field with a power spectrum ranging from scales between 7 and 470 kpc, with peak at $\sim 140$ kpc and mean central strength of $9.5 \pm 1.0 \ \mu$G, provides the best fit to our data. The high central magnetic field lies at the upper end of the range observed in other systems and supports the possibility of an hadronic contribution to the diffuse radio emission previously detected at the cluster center.",
New submissions,Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$Λ$CDM parameter with cosmological data,"Oliver H. E. Philcox,Eva Silverstein,Gonzalo Torroba",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.",
New submissions,Constraining Dynamical Dark Energy from Galaxy Clustering with Simulation-Based Priors,"Shu-Fan Chen,Mikhail M. Ivanov",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The effective-field theory based full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors (EFT-SBP) is the novel analysis of galaxy clustering data that allows one to combine merits of perturbation theory and simulation-based modeling in a unified framework. In this paper we use EFT-SBP with the galaxy clustering power spectrum and bispectrum data from BOSS in order to test the recent preference for dynamical dark energy reported by the DESI collaboration. While dynamical dark energy is preferred by the combination of DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, \textit{Planck} Cosmic Microwave Background, and Pantheon+ supernovae data, we show that this preference disappears once these data sets are combined with the usual BOSS EFT galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum likelihood. The use of the simulation-based priors in this analysis further weakens the case for dynamical dark energy by additionally shrinking the parameter posterior around the cosmological constant region. Specifically, the figure of merit of the dynamical dark energy constraints from the combined data set improves by $\approx 20\%$ over the usual EFT-full-shape analysis with the conservative priors. These results are made possible with a novel modeling approach to the EFT prior distribution with the Gaussian mixture models, which allows us to both accurately capture the EFT priors and retain the ability to analytically marginalize the likelihood over most of the EFT nuisance parameters. Our results challenge the dynamical dark energy interpretation of the DESI data and enable future EFT-SBP analyses of BOSS and DESI in the context of non-minimal cosmological models.",
New submissions,Lya2pcf: an efficient pipeline to estimate two- and three-point correlation functions of the Lyman-$α$ forest,"Josue De-Santiago,Rafael Gutiérrez-Balboa,Gustavo Niz,Alma X. González-Morales",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Studying the matter distribution in the universe through the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest allows us to constrain small-scale physics in the high-redshift regime. Spectroscopic quasar surveys are generating increasingly large datasets that require efficient algorithms to compute correlation functions. Moreover, cosmological analyses based on Lyman-$\alpha$ forests can significantly benefit from incorporating higher-order statistics alongside traditional two-point correlations. In this work, we present Lya2pcf, a pipeline designed to compute three-dimensional two-point and three-point correlation functions using Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. The code implements standard algorithms widely used in current spectroscopic surveys for computing the two-point correlation function with its distortion matrix, covariance matrices; and it naturally extends the two-point estimator to three-point correlations. Thanks to GPU optimization, Lya2pcf achieves a substantial reduction in computational time for both the two-point correlation function and its distortion matrix when compared to the widely used PICCA code. We apply Lya2pcf to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sixteenth data release (DR16) and a Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year-5 (DESI Y5) mock dataset, demonstrating overall performance gains over PICCA, especially on GPUs. We show the first measurement of the anisotropic three-point correlation function on a large spectroscopic sample for all possible triangles with scales up to 80 Mpc/h. The estimator's fast computation and the resulting signal-to-noise ratio -- above one for many triangle configurations -- demonstrate the viability of incorporating three-point statistics into future cosmological inference analyses, particularly with the larger datasets expected from Stage IV spectroscopic surveys.",
New submissions,CHEX-MATE: New detections and properties of the radio diffuse emission in massive clusters with MeerKAT,"M. Balboni,F. Gastaldello,A. Bonafede,A. Botteon,I. Bartalucci,R. Cassano,S.

Sereno,R.J. van Weeren",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Modern radio telescopes are revolutionising our understanding of non-thermal phenomena within galaxy clusters, collecting large samples of extended sources with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. In this work, we present novel MeerKAT observations for a sample of 21 galaxy clusters being part of the CHEX-MATE project. These systems were selected based on their high mass and displaying signs of dynamical activity. Thanks to the high-quality data in hand, we detect extended radio emission in every target considered. We report two new halos, three new relics and confirm a previous candidate halo and two candidate radio relics. When investigating the scaling relations with the cluster properties, we confirm the presence of a radio halo power-mass correlation and relate it to a higher radio halo emissivity in more massive clusters. For radio relics, we highlight the MeerKAT capabilities to significantly extend the depth of radio observations to a new, unexplored field of low radio power sources ($\lesssim 10^{23} ~ {\rm W~Hz^{-1}} $ at 1.28 GHz). Thanks to such high-sensitivity data, we show that the radio relic power can display a wide range of values for a given cluster mass and relic size. Ultimately, we discuss how current radio observations, in combination with large radio surveys, are becoming capable of testing numerical simulation predictions and being close to perform direct comparison with them, in order to gain new insights on the evolution of radio relics.",
New submissions,DeepCHART: Mapping the 3D dark matter density field from Ly$α$ forest surveys using deep learning,"Soumak Maitra(TIFR),Matteo Viel,Girish Kulkarni",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present DeepCHART (Deep learning for Cosmological Heterogeneity and Astrophysical Reconstruction via Tomography), a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density field at redshift $z=2.5$ from Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra. Leveraging a 3D variational autoencoder with a U-Net architecture, DeepCHART performs fast, likelihood-free inference, accurately capturing the non-linear gravitational dynamics and baryonic processes embedded in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. When applied to joint datasets combining Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption and coeval galaxy positions, the reconstruction quality improves further. For current surveys, such as Subaru/PFS, CLAMATO, and LATIS, with an average transverse sightline spacing of $d_\perp=2.4h^{-1}$cMpc, DeepCHART achieves high-fidelity reconstructions over the density range $0.4<\Delta_{\rm DM}<15$, with a voxel-wise Pearson correlation coefficient of $\rho\simeq 0.77$. These reconstructions are obtained using Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra with signal-to-noise ratios as low as 2 and instrumental resolution $R=2500$, matching Subaru/PFS specifications. For future high-density surveys enabled by instruments such as ELT/MOSAIC and WST/IFS with $d_\perp\simeq 1h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$, the correlation improves to $\rho\simeq 0.90$ across a wider dynamic range ($0.25<\Delta_{\rm DM}<40$). The framework reliably recovers the dark matter density PDF as well as the power spectrum, with only mild suppression at intermediate scales. In terms of cosmic web classification, DeepCHART successfully identifies 81% of voids, 75% of sheets, 63% of filaments, and 43% of nodes. We propose DeepCHART as a powerful and scalable framework for field-level cosmological inference, readily generalisable to other observables, and offering a robust, efficient means of maximising the scientific return of upcoming spectroscopic surveys.",
New submissions,The formation and evolution of Supermassive disks in IllustrisTNG,"Diego Pallero,Gaspar Galaz,Patricia B. Tissera,Facundo A. Gómez,Antonela Monachesi,Cristobal Sifón,Brian Tapia-Contreras",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Supermassive disks are outstanding galaxies whose formation and evolution are still poorly understood. They comprise a large variety of objects, ranging from large, low-surface-brightness galaxies, such as Malin 1, to the most spectacular superluminous spirals. However, we still do not know the physical mechanisms behind its formation, and whether they will be long-lived objects or whether their mass could destroy them in time. We aim to investigate the formation and evolution of these galaxies using the magnetohydrodynamical state-of-the-art simulation IllustrisTNG-100. We defined supermassive disks as galaxies with $\lambda / \sqrt{\varepsilon} \geq 0.31$ or 0.71, and with stellar mass log$_{10}M_\star/M_\odot > 10^{11}$. We studied the color, merging history, AGN history, and environment in which these galaxies reside. Supermassive disk galaxies typically experience a quiescent merging history, with $48\%$ experiencing no significant mergers at $z \leq 1$. Their stellar mass growth is driven mainly by star formation, unlike spheroidal galaxies, which require a significant number of mergers to form. Moreover, the mergers experienced by disk galaxies are generally rich in gas content, irrespective of whether they are minor or major events. Supermassive disks exist across various environments, from isolation to clusters, with $\sim 60\%$ inhabiting in isolation or low-mass groups, $\sim 25\%$ residing in massive groups, and $\sim15\%$ residing within galaxy clusters. When studying the evolution of supermassive disks selected at $z=0.5$, we show that when they gain sufficient mass, the probability of them maintaining their disk-like structure up to $z=0$ is relatively high ($\sim 60\%$). Lastly, while AGN significantly influences the regulation of star formation in galaxies, it does not directly alter their morphological structure.",
New submissions,Forecast for growth-rate measurement using peculiar velocities from LSST supernovae,"Damiano Rosselli,Bastien Carreres,Corentin Ravoux,Julian E. Bautista,Dominique Fouchez,Alex G. Kim,Benjamin Racine,Fabrice Feinstein,Bruno Sánchez,Aurelien Valade, TheLSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we investigate the feasibility of measuring the cosmic growth-rate parameter, $f\sigma_8$, using peculiar velocities (PVs) derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We produce simulations of different SN types using a realistic LSST observing strategy, incorporating noise, photometric detection from the Difference Image Analysis (DIA) pipeline, and a PV field modeled from the Uchuu UniverseMachine simulations. We test three observational scenarios, ranging from ideal conditions with spectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts and spectroscopic SN classification, to more realistic settings involving photometric classification and contamination from non-Ia supernovae. Using a maximum-likelihood technique, we show that LSST can measure $f\sigma_8$ with a precision of $10\%$ in the redshift range $ 0.02 < z < 0.14 $ in the most realistic case. Using three tomographic bins, LSST can constrain the growth-rate parameter with errors below $18\%$ up to $z = 0.14$. We also test the impact of contamination on the maximum likelihood method and find that for contamination fractions below $\sim 2\%$, the measurement remains unbiased. These results highlight the potential of the LSST SN Ia sample to complement redshift-space distortion measurements at high redshift, providing a novel avenue for testing general relativity and dark energy models.",
New submissions,Modeling the Cosmological Lyman-$α$ Forest at the Field Level,"Roger de Belsunce,Mikhail M. Ivanov,James M. Sullivan,Kazuyuki Akitsu,Shi-Fan Chen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The distribution of absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars, called the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$) forest, is a unique probe of cosmology and the intergalactic medium at high redshifts and small scales. The statistical power of ongoing redshift surveys demands precise theoretical tools to model the Ly-$\alpha$ forest. We address this challenge by developing an analytic, perturbative forward model to predict the Ly-$\alpha$ forest at the field level for a given set of cosmological initial conditions. Our model shows a remarkable performance when compared with the Sherwood hydrodynamic simulations: it reproduces the flux distribution, the Ly-$\alpha$ - dark matter halo cross-correlations, and the count-in-cell statistics at the percent level down to scales of a few Mpc. Our work provides crucial tools that bridge analytic modeling on large scales with simulations on small-scales, enabling field-level inference from Ly-$\alpha$ forest data and simulation-based priors for cosmological analyses. This is especially timely for realizing the full scientific potential of the Ly-$\alpha$ forest measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.",
New submissions,Fuzzy dark matter halos with repulsive self-interactions: coherent soliton and halo vortex network with moderate self-coupling,"Milos Indjin,Nick Keepfer,I-Kang Liu,Nick P. Proukakis,Gerasimos Rigopoulos",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas),"We examine the impact of repulsive self-interactions of moderate strength on fuzzy dark matter halos focusing on the core and granule size, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton. Our analysis extends across the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the gravitationally bound solitonic core. Within this examined range of self-coupling strengths, we find that mergers with a given initial spatial configuration and an increasing self-interaction strength $g$, result in cores with increased size that exhibit a reduced central density and oscillate with decreased frequency. All of these features are in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. The characteristic size of the granules in the surrounding halo also grows but by a much smaller amount relative to the core; accordingly, typical inter-vortex distances are also only mildly affected. We also measure the total length of the vortex network which, although less robust, shows no clear dependence on increasing $g$ and no signs of decay over the timescales of our simulations. Measures of coherence of the field behave as in the non-interacting case, again clearly separating the coherent core form the quasi-coherent halo. Interestingly, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing self-coupling strength, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.",
New submissions,"Dark from light (DfL): Inferring halo properties from luminous tracers with machine learning trained on cosmological simulations. I. Method, proof of concept & preliminary testing","Asa F. L. Bluck,Joanna M. Piotrowska,Paul Goubert,Roberto Maiolino,Camilo Casimiro,Thomas Pinto Franco,Nicolas Cea",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present Dark from Light (DfL) - a novel method to infer the dark sector in wide-field galaxy surveys, leveraging a machine learning approach trained on contemporary cosmological simulations. The aim of this algorithm is to provide a fast, straightforward, and accurate route to estimating dark matter halo masses and group membership in wide-field spectroscopic galaxy surveys. This approach requires a highly limited number of input parameters and yields full probability distribution functions for the output halo masses. To achieve this, we train a series of Random Forest (RF) regression models on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations at z=0-3, which provide model-dependent mappings from luminous tracers to dark matter halo properties. We incorporate the individual regression models into a virial group-finding algorithm (DfL), which outputs halo properties for observational-like input data. We test the method at z=0-2 for both the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG models, as well as in a cross-validation mode. We demonstrate that known halo masses can be recovered with a mean systematic bias of $\langle b \rangle = \pm 0.10\,$dex (resulting from simulation choice), a mean statistical uncertainty of $\langle \sigma \rangle = 0.12 \,$dex across epochs, and a central - (core) satellite classification accuracy of 96%. We establish that this approach yields superior halo mass recovery to standard abundance matching applied to groups identified through a friends-of-friends algorithm. Additionally, we compare the outputs of DfL to observational constraints on the $M_* - M_{\rm Halo}$ relation from strong gravitational lensing at $z \sim 0$, demonstrating the promise of this novel approach. Finally, we systematically quantify how DfL performs on observational-like input data with varying stellar mass uncertainty and spectroscopic incompleteness, enabling robust error calibration.",
New submissions,The Density Profile of Dynamical Halos,"Tristen Shields,Edgar M. Salazar,Eduardo Rozo,Aakanksha Adya,Calvin Osinga,Ze'ev Vladimir",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Among the most fundamental properties of a dark matter halo is its density profile. Motivated by the recent proposal by García et al. [R. García et. al., MNRAS 521, 2464 (2023)] to define a dynamical halo as the collection of orbiting particles in a gravitationally bound structure, we characterize the mean and scatter of the orbiting profile of dynamical halos as a function of their orbiting mass. We demonstrate that the orbiting profile of individual halos at fixed mass depends on a single dynamical variable -- the halo radius $r_{\rm h}$ -- which characterizes the spatial extent of the profile. The scatter in halo radius at fixed orbiting mass is $\approx 16\%$. Only a small fraction of this scatter arises due to differences in halo formation time, with late-forming halos being more compact (smaller halo radii). Accounting for this additional correlation results in an $\approx 11\%$ scatter in halo radius at fixed mass and halo formation time.",
New submissions,Hints of noncold dark matter? Observational constraints on barotropic dark matter with a constant equation of state parameter,"Yan-Hong Yao,Jian-Qi Liu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This study investigates the potential of a cosmological model termed $\Lambda w$DM, in which a cosmological constant play the role of dark energy and dark matter is barotropic and has a constant equation of state parameter ($w_{\rm dm}$), to address the $S_8$ tension between early- and late- universe observations. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets -- including Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Redshift Space Distortions (RSD), and weak lensing (WL) -- we constrain the $\Lambda w$DM compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis reveals a marginal preference for a non-zero $w_{\rm dm}=2.7^{+2.0}_{-1.9}\times10^{-7}$( at 95\% confidence level) when combining CMB, SDSS BAO, SNe Ia, RSD, and WL data, and a marginal preference for a non-zero $w_{\rm dm} = 2.29^{+1.9}_{-2.0} \times 10^{-7}$( at 95\% confidence level) when combining CMB, DESI Y1 BAO, SNe Ia, RSD, and WL data. In addition, we find that, compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\Lambda w$DM can alleviate the $S_8$ tension from $>3\sigma$ to $<1\sigma$. Furthermore, we find that, for CMB+SDSS+PP+RSD+WL datasets, the $\Lambda w$DM model is close to being positively preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model.",

New submissions,Head-on collisions of fuzzy/cold dark matter subhalos,Hyeonmo Koo,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We perform head-on collision simulations of compact dark matter subhalos using distinct numerical methods for fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) models. For FDM, we solve the Schrödinger-Poisson equations with a pseudospectral solver, while for CDM, we utilize a smoothed particle hydrodynamics N-body code. Our results show that velocity decrease of subhalos is significantly greater in FDM model than in CDM, particularly at lower initial velocities, attributed to gravitational cooling-a unique mechanism of stabilizing in FDM with dissipating kinetic energy. This stark contrast in energy dissipation between two DM models suggests that FDM may offer valuable insights into understanding the dynamic behaviors of DM during galaxy cluster collisions, such as those observed in the Bullet cluster and Abell 520. These findings strongly suggest that FDM is not only capable of explaining these complex astrophysical phenomena but also serves as a compelling alternative to the traditional CDM model, offering resolutions to longstanding discrepancies in DM behavior.",
New submissions,Testing Nambu-Goto approximation of cosmic string by lattice field simulations,"Zizhuo Zhao,Ligong Bian,Jing Shu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The precise calculation of gravitational wave (GW) and particle emissions from cosmic string networks is of significant theoretical and experimental interest. In this Letter, we perform numerical simulations of near-global and local string networks, comparing the GW spectra predictions from both lattice field simulation and the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation methods. We find the discrepancy between the GW spectra computed via the NG approximation and the lattice field simulation is negligible for near-global string and grow with increasing gauge coupling. Additionally, we confirm that particle emission significantly dominates energy emission, with the ratio of GW energy to particle energy approximately $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ for both near-global and local string scenarios.",
New submissions,Ultralight fuzzy dark matter review,"Andrew Eberhardt,Elisa G. M. Ferreira",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Ultralight dark matter refers to the lightest potential dark matter candidates. We will focus on the mass range that has been studied using astrophysical and cosmological observations, corresponding to a mass $10^{-24} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{eV}$. We will discuss the motivations for this mass range. The most studied model in this range corresponds to a minimally coupled, single, classical, spin-0 field comprising all dark matter. However, the work exploring extensions of this model (for example, higher spin, self-coupled, multiple field, and mixed models) will be one of the focuses of this review. The phenomenology associated with ultralight dark matter is rich and includes linear effects on the primordial power spectrum, core structures forming at the center of halos, nonlinear effects resulting in heating of stellar distributions, and non-relativistic effects relating to pulsar signals and black hole superradiance, to name a few. This set of effects has been studied using an equally extensive set of numerical tools. We will summarize the most common ones and discuss their applications and limitations. Ultralight dark matter also has a wide variety of observational constraints, including halo mass functions, the Lyman-alpha forest, halo density profiles, stellar dynamics, and black hole spins. We will review them focusing on the observations made, the method of study, and the major systematics. We will end with a discussion of the current status of the field and future work needed.",
New submissions,Microlensing of dark matter models in the Milky Way,"Bichu Li,Chan-Yu Tang,Zhuo-Ran Huang,Lei-Hua Liu",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim 2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1 - 0.3$ days) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles -- affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive 95\% C.L. upper bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under the Einasto and Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results underscore the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.",
New submissions,Is $ω_0 ω_a$CDM a good model for the clumpy Universe?,"Fernanda Oliveira,Felipe Avila,Camila Franco,Armando Bernui",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The DESI collaboration just obtained a set of precise BAO measurements, that combined with CMB and SNIa datasets show that the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at more than $4\,\sigma$, to describe the dynamics of the expanding Universe. This raises the question whether this model also suitably describes the clumpy Universe. Also lately, detailed analyses of diverse cosmic tracers resulted in a new dataset of measurements of an observable from the clumpy Universe: $\sigma_8(z)$, spanning a high-redshift data $z \in [0.013, 3.8]$. In this work we use this dataset of 15 $\sigma_8(z_i)$ measurements to study the viability of the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM cosmological model to explain the clustered Universe. Our analyses compare the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM model with the $\sigma_8(z)$ function reconstructed from the data points using Gaussian Process. Moreover, we perform a similar evaluation of the $\Lambda$CDM model considering Planck and~DESI best-fit parameters. In addition, we implemented robustness tests regarding Gaussian Process reconstruction to support our results.",
New submissions,Probing Generalized Emergent Dark Energy with DESI DR2,"Vipin kumar Sharma,Himanshu Chaudhary,Sanved Kolekar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"As an update on the initial findings of DESI, the new results provide the first hint of potential deviations from a cosmological constant ($w=-1$), which, if confirmed with significance $>5\sigma$, will falsify the $\Lambda$CDM model. We consider a novel generalised form of an emergent dark energy model and confront this through various data sets (Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release (DESI DR2), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) compilation, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors) and simultaneously constrain the dark energy (DE) equation of state and energy density $f_{DE}(z)$. The results for the joint posteriors of cosmological parameters and the reconstructed dark energy EoS $w(z)$ with the energy density $f_{DE}(z)$ for various combinations of data sets are discussed, which favors quintessence nature. Specifically, $w(0) = -0.820$ with DESI DR2 + CMB, $-0.845$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + PP$^+$, $-0.828$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + Union3, and $-0.804$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + DESY5. We adopted a novel method to probe shifts in the generalized emergent dark energy (GEDE) parameter ($\Delta$) by mapping 2D marginalized posterior distributions in the $\Delta-\Omega_{m0}$ plane. Our analysis consistently reveals a preference for negative $\Delta$ across multiple combinations of observational datasets. Incorporating these values into the matter power spectrum further supports the GEDE framework's viability. We quantify the model's performance using the Bayes factor.",
New submissions,New Agegraphic Dark Energy Driven Reconstruction of \boldmath{$f(Q)$} Gravity and its Cosmological Implications,"Rajdeep Mazumdar,Kalyan Malakar,Mrinnoy M. Gohain,Kalyan Bhuyan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we perform reconstruction of \( f(Q) \) gravity inspired by the New Agegraphic Dark Energy (NADE) model, aiming to account for the Universe's late time acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant. Utilizing a power law scale factor \( a(t) = a_0 t^h \), we derive an analytic form for \( f(Q) \) based on a correspondence with NADE, where the conformal time serves as the infrared cutoff. The resulting model naturally recovers General Relativity in the limit and exhibits a geometrically motivated dark energy component. We constrain the model parameters using recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2 BAO and previous BAO observations through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter \( H(z) \) demonstrates excellent agreement with observational data, achieving high \( R^2 \) values and low \(\chi^2_{\min}\), AIC, and BIC scores, outperforming the standard \( \Lambda \)CDM model. Further, we investigate the cosmological evolution using the deceleration parameter \( q(z) \), effective equation of state \( \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) \), and Om diagnostics. The model exhibits a clear transition from deceleration to acceleration with a present value \( q(0) \in \left[-0.5879, -0.3333\right] \) and transition redshift $z_{\mathrm{tr}} \sim 0.5209-0.8126$, while maintaining \( -1 < \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) < -1/3 \), indicating quintessence like behavior. Om diagnostics consistently show a negative slope, further confirming deviation from \( \Lambda \)CDM. Energy condition analysis reveals that WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied, while SEC is violated only at low redshifts which is consistent with cosmic acceleration. Overall, the reconstructed \( f(Q) \) model provides a viable, observationally consistent, and theoretically motivated alternative to standard dark energy scenarios.",
Cross submissions,Power-Law Bounces in $f(R)$ Gravity: Analysis of the Ekpyrosis and Accelerating Regimes,"Saurya Das,Peter Dunsby,S. Shajidul Haque,Seturumane Tema",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.",
Cross submissions,"Stability of Thin Shell and Wormhole Configurations: Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild -- (Anti-) de Sitter, and FLRW Spacetimes","Travis Seth Rippentrop,Avijit Bera,Mustapha Ishak",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The stability of thin shell wormholes and black holes to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations about a static equilibrium is analyzed. Thin shell formalism is explored and junctions formed from combinations of Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild - de Sitter, and Schwarzschild - anti-de Sitter, as well as Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes are considered. The regions of stability for these different combinations are thoroughly described and plotted as a function of mass ratios of the Schwarzschild masses and radii of the wormhole throats. A taxonomy of the qualitative features of the various configurations and parameter spaces is developed, illustrating the stability regions when present. The considered wormholes are all found to be unstable in the causal region.",
Cross submissions,Earth-Scattering Induced Modulation in Low-Threshold Dark Matter Experiments,"Xavier Bertou,Ansh Desai,Timon Emken,Rouven Essig,Tomer Volansky,Tien-Tien Yu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Dark matter particles with sufficiently large interactions with ordinary matter can scatter in the Earth before reaching and scattering in a detector. This induces a modulation in the signal rate with a period of one sidereal day. We calculate this modulation for sub-GeV dark matter particles that interact either with a heavy or an ultralight dark-photon mediator and investigate the resulting signal in low-threshold detectors consisting of silicon, xenon, or argon targets. The scattering in the Earth is dominated by dark matter scatters off nuclei, while the signal in the detector is easiest to observe from dark matter scattering off electrons. We investigate the properties of the modulation signal and provide projections of the sensitivity of future experiments. We find that a search for a modulation signal can probe new regions of parameter space near the energy thresholds of current experiments, where the data are typically dominated by backgrounds.",
Cross submissions,"Uniform rate inflation in $f(T, \mathcal{T})$-gravity","Priyanka Mandal,B. C. Paul",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present uniform rate inflation in a modified $f(T, \mathcal{T}) $ gravity. It is found that early inflation can be realized even with a scalar field field with a quadratic potential and a negative cosmological constant. We construct inflationary model for the inflaton field without slow-roll approximation. The inflaton field rolling at a constant speed permits a universe with sufficient inflation which encompasses the present universe fairly well. The initial value of the scalar satisfies a lower limit which is sufficiently large compared to the field required for chaotic inflation. The Planck prediction for cosmological perturbations are estimated. It is found that the cosmological model is stable.",
Cross submissions,A Non-Inflationary Axion and ALP Misalignment Mechanism,Robert Brandenberger(McGill University),High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Based on considerations of quantum gravity, global symmetries which lead to axions as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons after low scale symmetry breaking cannot be exact at the Planck scale. Here, we show that Planck-suppressed terms which yield this symmetry breaking may provide a non-inflationary misalignment mechanism which can generate coherent oscillations of the axion and axion-like particle (ALP) fields at low temperatures.",
Cross submissions,Perturbative unitarity bounds on field-space curvature in de Sitter spacetime: purity vs scattering amplitude,"Qianhang Cai,Tomoya Inada,Masataka Ishikawa,Kanji Nishii,Toshifumi Noumi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study perturbative unitarity bounds on the field-space curvature in de Sitter spacetime, using the momentum-space entanglement approach recently proposed by Pueyo, Goodhew, McCulloch, and Pajer. As an illustration, we perform a perturbative computation of the purity in two-scalar models and compare the resulting unitarity bounds with those obtained via a flat space approximation. In particular, we find that perturbative unitarity imposes an upper bound on the field-space curvature of the Hubble scale order, in addition to a bound analogous to the flat space result. This reflects the thermal nature of de Sitter spacetime. We also discuss generalizations to higher-dimensional field spaces.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Wave Signatures of Periodic Motion near Higher-Derivative Einstein-Æther Black Holes,"Sayantan Choudhury,Md Khalid Hossain,Gulnur Bauyrzhan,Koblandy Yerzhanov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Higher-derivative modifications of general relativity are generically expected from effective field theory approaches to quantum gravity, and they arise naturally in Lorentz-violating theories such as Einstein-Ether gravity. In this work, we investigate black hole spacetimes within Einstein-Ether theory supplemented by quadratic curvature corrections, including terms proportional to $R^2$, $R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu}$, and $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho} R^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$. We derive the corrected static, spherically symmetric metric perturbatively and examine its effects on the geodesic structure and gravitational wave emission. In particular, we analyze periodic timelike orbits in this background and compute the associated tensor-mode gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole approximation. Our results demonstrate that even small higher-derivative corrections can induce distinguishable shifts in the orbital dynamics and imprint characteristic phase modulations and harmonic deformations in the gravitational wave signal. These effects modify the frequency spectrum and amplitude envelope of $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$ in a manner sensitive to the coupling constants $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$, and the Ether parameter $c_{13}$. The resulting signatures provide a potential observational window into ultraviolet deviations from general relativity and Lorentz symmetry in the strong-field regime.",
Cross submissions,Khronon-Tensor theory reproducing MOND and the cosmological model,"Luc Blanchet,Constantinos Skordis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose an alternative scalar-tensor theory based on the Khronon scalar field labeling a family of space-like three-dimensional hypersurfaces. This theory leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at galactic scales for stationary systems, recovers GR plus a cosmological constant in the strong field regime, and is in agreement with the standard cosmological model and the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies.",
Cross submissions,New Constraints on Neutrino-Dark Matter Interactions: A Comprehensive Analysis,"P. S. Bhupal Dev,Doojin Kim,Deepak Sathyan,Kuver Sinha,Yongchao Zhang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present a comprehensive analysis of the interactions of neutrinos with the dark sector within the simplified model framework. We first derive the exact analytic formulas for the differential scattering cross sections of neutrinos with scalar, fermion, and vector dark matter (DM) for light dark sector models with mediators of different types. We then implement the full catalog of constraints on the parameter space of the neutrino-DM and neutrino-mediator couplings and masses, including cosmological and astrophysical bounds coming from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background, DM and neutrino self-interactions, DM collisional damping, and astrophysical neutrino sources, as well as laboratory constraints from 3-body meson decays and invisible $Z$ decays. We find that most of the benchmarks in the DM mass-coupling plane adopted in previous studies to get an observable neutrino-DM interaction effect are actually ruled out by a combination of the above-mentioned constraints, especially the laboratory ones which are robust against astrophysical uncertainties and independent of the cosmological history. To illustrate the consequences of our new results, we take the galactic supernova neutrinos in the MeV energy range as a concrete example and highlight the difficulties in finding any observable effect of neutrino-DM interactions. Finally, we identify new benchmark points potentially promising for future observational prospects of the attenuation of the galactic supernova neutrino flux and comment on their implications for the detection prospects in future large-volume neutrino experiments such as JUNO, Hyper-K, and DUNE. We also comment on the ultraviolet-embedding of the effective neutrino-DM couplings.",
