New submissions,"pop-cosmos: Insights from generative modeling of a deep, infrared-selected galaxy population","Stephen Thorp,Hiranya V. Peiris,Gurjeet Jagwani,Sinan Deger,Justin Alsing,Boris Leistedt,Daniel J. Mortlock,Anik Halder,Joel Leja",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present an extension of the pop-cosmos model for the evolving galaxy population up to redshift $z\sim6$. The model is trained on distributions of observed colors and magnitudes, from 26-band photometry of $\sim420,000$ galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog with Spitzer IRAC $\textit{Ch. 1}<26$. The generative model includes a flexible distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters, and a depth-dependent photometric uncertainty model, both represented using score-based diffusion models. We use the trained model to predict scaling relationships for the galaxy population, such as the stellar mass function, star-forming main sequence, and gas-phase and stellar metallicity vs. mass relations, demonstrating reasonable-to-excellent agreement with previously published results. We explore the connection between mid-infrared emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-formation rate, finding high AGN activity for galaxies above the star-forming main sequence at $1\lesssim z\lesssim 2$. Using the trained population model as a prior distribution, we perform inference of the redshifts and SPS parameters for 429,669 COSMOS2020 galaxies, including 39,588 with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts. The resulting redshift estimates exhibit minimal bias ($\text{median}[\Delta_z]=-8\times10^{-4}$), scatter ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=0.0132$), and outlier fraction ($6.19\%$) for the full $0<z<6$ spectroscopic compilation. These results establish that pop-cosmos can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to forward-model modern wide--deep surveys for Stage IV cosmology. We publicly release pop-cosmos software, mock galaxy catalogs, and COSMOS2020 redshift and SPS parameter posteriors.",
New submissions,Early Growth of Structure in Warm Wave Dark Matter,"Mustafa A. Amin,Simon May,Mehrdad Mirbabayi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore the growth of structure in wave-like dark matter models, where the field and density spectra are peaked at sub-horizon wavenumbers. Starting with the Schrödinger-Poisson system, we derive the scale-dependent evolution of the matter power spectrum during radiation and matter domination. We find a suppression of adiabatic perturbations during radiation domination, controlled by a free-streaming length, and scale-dependent growth of the initially white-noise isocurvature power, controlled by a Jeans scale during matter domination. The results are in qualitative, and in some regimes quantitative, agreement with the quasi-particle picture. We verify the analytic results of the power spectrum with 3+1-dimensional cosmological Schrödinger-Poisson simulations. We propose an analytic formula for the halo mass function, which is in rough agreement with the simulation results at early times after matter-radiation equality. Our simulations show that early halos typically host a soliton.",
New submissions,Effective Viscosity in the Intracluster Medium During Magnetic Field Amplification via Turbulent Dynamo,"S. Adduci Faria,R. Santos-Lima,E. M. de Gouveia Dal Pino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Galaxy clusters host a hot, diffuse plasma with poorly understood viscosity and magnetic field amplification. Astrophysical plasmas are often modeled with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but low collision rates in environments like the intracluster medium (ICM) hinder thermodynamic equilibrium, causing pressure anisotropies and high viscosity. High-$\beta$ plasmas, dominated by thermal pressure, are prone to instabilities (e.g., firehose, mirror) that limit anisotropy, reduce viscosity, and enable small-scale dynamo-driven magnetic amplification. This study examines viscosity evolution in the ICM during turbulent magnetic field amplification. We performed 3D MHD simulations of forced turbulence with an initially weak, uniform magnetic field. Using the CGL-MHD framework, we incorporate anisotropic pressure dynamics and instability-driven anisotropy limitation. We analyze effective viscosity and dynamo evolution, comparing results with Braginskii-MHD and uniform-viscosity MHD. Results show viscosity decreases over time, allowing magnetic field amplification to saturation levels similar to non-viscous MHD. Viscosity distribution becomes bimodal, reflecting (i) collisional values and (ii) turbulence-dominated values proportional to $10^{-4} L_{\rm turb} U_{\rm turb}$ in unstable regions. At saturation, 60% of plasma retains collisional viscosity. Braginskii-MHD reproduces similar magnetic amplification and viscosity structures. However, uniform-viscosity MHD, where viscosity equals the mean saturated CGL-MHD value, fails to capture the turbulence inertial range. These findings highlight the need for anisotropic viscosity models in studying ICM processes like magnetic topology, cosmic ray transport, and AGN-driven shocks. Moreover, our CGL-MHD and Braginskii-MHD models match the Coma cluster density fluctuation spectrum, reinforcing its weakly collisional nature.",
New submissions,Inflationary attractors and radiative corrections in light of ACT,William J. Wolf,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky-Higgs inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections (which one can argue should be generally expected) calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.",
New submissions,Constraints on Dark Energy Models Using Late Universe Probes,"Shubham Barua,Shantanu Desai",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We use late Universe probes - Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus compilation, Quasars, and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) BAO data - along with Cosmic Chronometers or Megamasers to constrain various dark energy parameterizations. These include the standard $\Lambda$CDM model ($w_0=-1,w_a=0$), as well as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Transitional Dark Energy (TDE) parameterizations. We find that across all parameterizations, the constrained values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ remain within $(1-2)\sigma$ of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, irrespective of spatial curvature, dataset combinations, or prior choices. We find from Bayesian model comparison that $\Lambda$CDM remains the most favored model for both flat and non-flat cases, with results remaining robust under different priors. Across all dataset combinations, we reaffirm the fact that LRG1 and LRG2 data points from the DESI BAO dataset are responsible for driving the preference for dynamical dark energy.",
New submissions,New tests of cosmic distance duality relation with DESI 2024 BAO observations,"Qiumin Wang,Shuo Cao,Jianyong Jiang,Kaituo Zhang,Xinyue Jiang,Tonghua Liu,Chengsheng Mu,Dadian Cheng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this paper, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), as required by the Etherington reciprocity theorem, which connects the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance via the relation \( D_{\rm L}(z) = D_{\rm A}(z)(1+z)^2 \). Our analysis is based on the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements provided by the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)/Extended BOSS (eBOSS), and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) surveys. Specifically, an unbiased test of the CDDR is performed through a novel, model-independent method inspired by the two-point diagnostic approach, with DES-SN5YR and Pantheon type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample reconstructed using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique. This methodology effectively eliminates all nuisance parameters, including the sound horizon scale \( r_{\rm d} \) from BAO and the absolute magnitude \( M_{\rm B} \) from SN Ia. A set of \( N-1 \) independent CDDR ratios \( \eta_{ij} \) are constructed for statistical analysis. At the current observational level, no significant deviation from the CDDR is observed at low redshifts, whereas we find positive evidence ($>2\sigma$ C.L.) of deviation from the CDDR at two high redshifts ($z=2.33$ and $z=2.334$). Therefore, our results confirm that the BAO measurement provides a powerful tool to test such fundamental relation in modern cosmology.",
New submissions,21 cm Signal from the Thermal Evolution of Lyman-$α$ during Cosmic Dawn,"Janakee Raste,Shiv K. Sethi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Lyman-$\alpha$ photons couple the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen (HI) to the kinetic temperature during the era of cosmic dawn. During this process, they also exchange energy with the medium, heating and cooling the HI. In addition, we expect X-ray photons to heat the mostly neutral gas during this era. We solve this coupled system (Lyman-$\alpha$-HI system along with X-ray heating) for a period of 500 Myr (redshift range $8 <z < 25$). Our main results are: (a) without X-ray heating, the temperature of the gas reaches an equilibrium which is nearly independent of photon intensity and only weakly dependent on the expansion of the universe. The main determinant of the quasi-static temperature is the ratio of injected and continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, (b) while X-ray photons provide an additional source of heating at initial times, for large enough Lyman-$\alpha$ photon intensity, the system tends to reach the same quasi-static temperature as expected without additional heating. This limit is reached when the density of photons close to the Lyman-$\alpha$ resonance far exceeds the HI number density, (c) we compute the global HI signal for these scenarios. In the limit of the large density of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, the spin temperature of the hyperfine line is fixed. This freezes the global HI signal from the era of cosmic dawn and the cross-over redshift from absorption to emission. This feature depends only on the ratio of injected to continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, and the global HI signal can help us determine this ratio.",

Tarlé,M. Walther,B. A. Weaver,H. Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Lyman-alpha forests observed in the spectra of high-redshift quasars can be used as a tracer of the cosmological matter density to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Extraction of cosmological information from these studies requires modeling of the forest correlations. While the models depend most importantly on the bias parameters of the intergalactic medium (IGM), they also depend on the numbers and characteristics of high-column-density systems (HCDs) ranging from Lyman-limit systems with column densities log NHI/1cm^{-2} > 17 to damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) with log NHI/1cm^{-2} > 20.2. These HCDs introduce broad damped absorption characteristic of a Voigt profile. Consequently they imprint a component on the power spectrum whose modes in the radial direction are suppressed, leading to a scale-dependent bias. Using mock data sets of known HCD content, we test a model that describes this effect in terms of the distribution of column densities of HCDs, the Fourier transforms of their Voigt profiles and the bias of the halos containing the HCDs. Our results show that this physically well-motivated model describes the effects of HCDs with an accuracy comparable to that of the ad-hoc models used in published forest analyses. We also discuss the problems of applying the model to real data, where the HCD content and their bias is uncertain.",
New submissions,Simple quintessence models in light of DESI-BAO observations,"James M. Cline,Varun Muralidharan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Recent analyses from the DESI collaboration suggest that the dark energy density of the Universe may be decreasing with time, slowing the acceleration of the scale factor $a$. Typically these studies are performed assuming an ansatz for the equation of state $w(a)$. In this work, we instead consider simple models of a scalar quintessence potential with linear and quadratic behavior, which could be more representative of real models than particular parametrizations of $w(a)$. We observe a significant preference for dynamical dark energy when using supernova data from DESY5 along with DESI BAO and Planck data, at the cost of slightly exacerbating the Hubble tension. However, when using supernova data from Pantheon+ or Union3, we find only a mild preference for dynamical dark energy.",
New submissions,A new classification of ex-situ and in-situ Galactic globular clusters based on a method trained on Milky Way analogues in the TNG50 cosmological simulations,"Pierre Boldrini,Paola Di Matteo,Chervin Laporte,Oscar Agertz,Sergey Khoperskov,Giulia Pagnini",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a novel method combining existing cosmological simulations and orbital integration to study the hierarchical assembly of globular cluster (GC) populations in the Milky Way (MW). Our method models the growth and evolution of GC populations across various galactic environments as well as the dynamical friction and mass loss experienced by these objects. This allows us to track the trajectory of about 18,000 GCs over cosmic time in 198 MW-like galaxies from TNG50. This cosmological-scale tracking of the dynamics of in-situ and ex-situ GC populations with such a large statistical sample allows us to confirm the presence of an overlap between the two populations in MW-like galaxies, occurring below an energy threshold of $E < 0.7 E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$ where $E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$ is the energy of a circular orbit at the galaxy's stellar half-mass radius $r_{\rm hm}^{*}$. Our results challenge the validity of current classification schemes commonly adopted in the literature, which ultimately fail to provide a clear separation between the two populations. Instead, they tend to isolate only a subset of the ex-situ GCs. More precisely, we argue that it is highly unlikely to find in-situ clusters at $E > 0.7 E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$, and that the real challenge lies in distinguishing the two populations below this energy threshold. In this context, we provide new predictions regarding the origins of the MW GCs observed with Gaia, as well as a comparison with existing literature. Additionally, we highlight that even if ex-situ clusters share a common origin, they inevitably lose their dynamical coherence in the $E$-$L_{z}$ space within MW-like galaxies. We observe a dispersion of GC groups as a function of $E$ and $L_{z}$, primarily driven by the evolution of the galactic potential over time and by dynamical friction, respectively.",
New submissions,Validation of Fast Mocks Generation for CSST Photometric Survey,"Yiming Hu,Yu Yu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Weak lensing has become a powerful tool for probing the matter distribution in the Universe and constraining cosmological parameters. This paper aims to explore the fast mock generation pipeline to obtain the covariance matrix of the $3\times 2$pt analysis for the upcoming China Space Station Telescope (CSST). We adopt the $N_\mathrm{side}$ pipeline, which generates matter distribution with lognormal assumptions, to create full-sky galaxy mocks with certain two-point statistics. We also employ the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation to test the accuracy of the covariance matrix from the mock-generated galaxy catalogue. Our work validates the accuracy of the $3\times 2$pt statistics in both spherical harmonic space and real space. The critical scale below which the fractional error of correlation exceeds 1$\%$ can decrease as the resolution parameter $N_\mathrm{side}$ increases. After excluding certain scales, the covariance matrix from the mock-generated galaxy catalogue can constrain the cosmological parameters with 0.1$\%$ accuracy. This work demonstrates the potential of $\texttt{GLASS}$ for real-space cosmological measurements and highlights the importance of discarding appropriate scales.",
New submissions,Decay of dark energy into dark matter in a metric $f(R)$ gravity: effective running Hubble constant,"Giovanni Montani,Mariaveronica De Angelis,Maria Giovanna Dainotti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We examine a modified late-Universe dynamics where dark energy decays into dark matter, within the framework of metric $f(R)$-gravity in the Jordan frame. After a detailed analysis of the modified $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model, we introduce a theoretical diagnostic tool to capture the emergence of an effective running Hubble constant as a function of redshift. We then compare this theoretical model with the 40-bin analysis of the Supernova Pantheon sample. This comparison allows us to determine the value of the additional free parameter that appears in our model, beyond those of the standard $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model. Our modified late Universe dynamics provides a good-quality fit to the binned data, improving upon the previous phenomenological interpretation based on a power-law decay. However, unlike the power-law model, our approach cannot be extrapolated to the recombination redshift to match the Hubble constant measured by the Planck satellite. In fact, the dynamics resulting from the binned Pantheon sample analysis address only weakly the Hubble tension between the SH0ES and the Planck Collaboration values of the Hubble constant. Here we provide a convincing representation of the observed deviation of the cosmological dynamics from the $\Lambda$CDM-one, as it out-stands from the low redshift observed sources.",
New submissions,Scrutinizing the impact of the solar modulation on AMS-02 antiproton excess,"Kai-Kai Duan,Xiao Wang,Wen-Hao Li,Zhi-Hui Xu,Yue-Lin Sming Tsai,Yi-Zhong Fan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"This study examines the impact of solar modulation on the antiproton excess observed by AMS-02, which may indicate dark matter (DM) annihilation. We analyze three solar modulation models: the force-field approximation (FFA), a time-, charge-, and rigidity-dependent FFA, and a three-dimensional numerical simulation based on the Parker transport equation. Based on AMS-02 latest antiproton data (2025), our results show that the significance of the DM signal is sensitive to the chosen modulation model, with a 2$\sigma$ signal for the FFA (4$\sigma$ if including data from H, He, C, O, B/C, and B/O) and a reduced significance for more complex models. We also address systematic uncertainties using two methods: the add-in-quadrature method, which assumes uncorrelated uncertainties between energy bins, and the nuisance parameter method, which treats systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters during the fitting process. Fitted to AMS-02 antiproton data, DM annihilation to the $b\bar{b}$ scenario with three different solar modulation models shows that the add-in-quadrature method causes overfitting, whereas the nuisance parameters approach leads to underfitting. Statistically, the signal region of the FFA model using the add-in-quadrature method is the most reliable. This work highlights the need for refined solar modulation models and a better treatment of uncertainties for a conclusive interpretation of the AMS-02 data.",

Weller(DES Collaboration)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present cosmological constraints from Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) weak lensing data using persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique that tracks how features like clusters and voids evolve across density thresholds. For the first time, we apply spherical persistent homology to galaxy survey data through the algorithm TopoS2, which is optimized for curved-sky analyses and HEALPix compatibility. Employing a simulation-based inference framework with the Gower Street simulation suite, specifically designed to mimic DES Y3 data properties, we extract topological summary statistics from convergence maps across multiple smoothing scales and redshift bins. After neural network compression of these statistics, we estimate the likelihood function and validate our analysis against baryonic feedback effects, finding minimal biases (under $0.3\sigma$) in the $\Omega_\mathrm{m}-S_8$ plane. Assuming the $w$CDM model, our combined Betti numbers and second moments analysis yields $S_8 = 0.821 \pm 0.018$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.304\pm0.037$-constraints 70% tighter than those from cosmic shear two-point statistics in the same parameter plane. Our results demonstrate that topological methods provide a powerful and robust framework for extracting cosmological information, with our spherical methodology readily applicable to upcoming Stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys.",
New submissions,Revisiting $Λ$CDM extensions in light of re-analyzed CMB data,"Jacobo Asorey,Javier de Cruz Pérez",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the last years with the increasing precision in cosmological observations we have been able to establish an standard model of cosmology, the so-called $\Lambda$CDM, but also find some tensions between cosmological probes that are difficult to explain within the context of this model. We tested several phenomenological extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM with the newest datasets from the chain CMB+BAO+SNIa, to see whether they are able to alleviate the aforementioned tensions. We find that when the updated version of the Planck CMB likelihood (PR4 LoLLiPoP and HiLLiPoP), with respect to the more used likelihoods (PR4 CamSpec and PR3), is considered, the lensing anomaly is reduced, and the preference for $A_L>1$ and $\Omega_k<0$ is less significant. From the CMB+BAO+SNIa dataset, in the context of the parameterization $w_0w_a$CDM we find a preference for a time-evoling dark energy over the rigid cosmological constant which is consistent with the most recent results from DESI collaboration.",
New submissions,Mass models of galaxy clusters from a non-parametric weak-lensing reconstruction,"Tobias Mistele,Federico Lelli,Stacy McGaugh,James Schombert,Benoit Famaey",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We study the CLASH sample of galaxy clusters using a new deprojection method for weak gravitational lensing observations. This method is non-parametric, allowing us to infer mass profiles, or equivalently circular velocities, without having to assume a specific halo profile. While this method assumes spherical symmetry, we show that, on average, triaxiality is unlikely to significantly affect our results. We use this method to study the total mass profiles of the CLASH clusters, as well as the relation between their total and baryonic components: (1) We find that the implied circular velocities are consistent with being approximately flat at large radii, akin to the rotation curves of galaxies. (2) We infer radially resolved baryonic mass fractions, finding that these vary significantly from cluster to cluster and depend strongly on the details of the X-ray gas mass profiles. Since the gas mass profiles are poorly constrained at large radii, it is unclear whether the CLASH clusters reach the cosmic baryon fraction expected in $\Lambda$CDM. (3) The non-parametric masses are consistent with the stellar mass--halo mass relation expected in $\Lambda$CDM; fitting parametric NFW halos to the non-parametric mass profiles gives results in overall agreement with the expected mass-concentration relation, though the concentrations are relatively poorly constrained. (4) Galaxy clusters systematically deviate from the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) and the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) defined by galaxies, but the magnitude of the offset depends strongly on the gas mass extrapolation at large radii. Contrary to some previous results based on hydrostatic equilibrium, we find that galaxy clusters may fall on the same BTFR and RAR as galaxies if one adds a suitable positive baryonic mass component.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Waves from Spectator Scalar Fields,"Marcos A. G. Garcia,Sarunas Verner",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a novel mechanism for gravitational wave (GW) production sourced by spectator scalar fields during inflation. These fields, while not driving cosmic expansion, generate blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations that naturally satisfy current CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced power spectra at smaller scales accessible to GW detectors. The resulting GW spectrum spans an exceptionally broad frequency range from $10^{-20}$ to $1$ Hz, with amplitudes ranging from $\Omega_{\text{GW}}h^2 \sim 10^{-20}$ to $10^{-12}$ depending on the reheating temperature and spectator field mass. For heavy spectator fields with effective masses near the inflationary Hubble scale $H_I$, the mechanism produces observable signals across multiple detector bands accessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and ground-based detectors. Our analysis reveals multiple complementary constraints on spectator field parameters. GW-induced limits on the effective number of relativistic species ($\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$) require $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.61 H_I$, stronger than CMB isocurvature bounds alone ($m_\chi \gtrsim 0.54 H_I$). The non-observation of primordial B-modes by \textit{Planck} provides stronger constraints $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.66 H_I$, with projected LiteBIRD sensitivity potentially reaching $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.70 H_I$. This mechanism enables a unique multi-messenger probe of beyond the Standard Model physics during inflation, providing simultaneous constraints on inflationary dynamics, dark matter production, and reheating through current and next-generation GW experiments.",
Cross submissions,A new model of spontaneous scalarization of black holes induced by curvature and matter,"Zakaria Belkhadria,Salvatore Mignemi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a new model of black hole spontaneous scalarization that combines a scalar--Gauss--Bonnet interaction with a non-minimal coupling to a $U(1)$ gauge field (a dark photon or an electromagnetic field). This construction generalizes earlier single-coupling setups and allows both curvature-induced and matter-induced scalarization within one framework, which allows us to overcome the limitations of each mechanism alone. We focus on charged, spherically symmetric black holes and demonstrate that our model substantially expands the range of black hole masses and charges that permit scalar hair. Negative Gauss--Bonnet couplings, previously associated only with near-extremal charges or rapidly spinning black holes, now trigger scalarization for much broader charge intervals. We develop a numerical procedure to solve the field equations, and investigate the various properties of these black holes. This results in new branches emerging at distinct mass thresholds, a behavior not seen in the pure Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet or Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet--Ricci models. The scalar charge depends sensitively on the coupling parameters and on the $U(1)$ charge. Our analysis also shows that these black holes have larger entropy than their Reissner--Nordström counterparts and can become overcharged, surpassing the usual extremal limit of charge-to-mass ratio. Analyzing the scalar charge behavior suggests that adding matter-coupling appears to stabilize solutions that were previously prone to higher-order instabilities in pure Gauss--Bonnet models with quadratic coupling and broadens the range of possible configurations, making this model a promising candidate for further studies in strong gravity.",
Cross submissions,Reheating and relic gravitational waves as remedies for degeneracies of non-canonical natural inflation,"Karam Bahari,Soma Heydari,Kayoomars Karami",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Here, a natural non-canonical inflationary model based on a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We analyze the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of the model and identify their degeneracies with respect to the free parameters. Notably, $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ are independent of the model parameters that leads to unresolved degeneracies. Employing the constraints on reheating parameters such as the reheating duration $N_{\rm{reh}}$, the reheating temperature $T_{\rm{reh}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{reh}}$, is found to be insufficient to fully break these degeneracies. However, the relic gravitational wave spectrum provides a way to break degeneracy with respect to the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$, degeneracy with respect to the potential parameter $f$ persist. Finally, we specify the allowed ranges for the inflationary duration $N$ and the parameter $\alpha$, in light of the latest observational data. These results highlight the role of relic gravitational waves in refining inflationary models and illustrate the challenges in fully resolving parameter degeneracies.",
Cross submissions,Implications of DESI for Dark Matter & Cosmic Birefringence,"Basabendu Barman,Sudhakantha Girmohanta",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore an interacting dark matter (DM)-dark energy (DE) framework that naturally yields an effective dynamical DE equation of state crossing the phantom barrier at early times, as indicated by recent DESI data, while also accounting for the observed isotropic rotation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) linear polarization. Within this unified framework, we also explain the DM relic abundance without introducing additional fields or couplings. Depending on the DE potential, we identify two viable scenarios: a superheavy freeze-in DM requiring a high reheating temperature, or a strongly interacting dark sector with a GeV-TeV scale thermal DM candidate.",
Cross submissions,Unitarity-Conserving Non-Minimally Coupled Inflation and the ACT Spectral Index,J.McDonald,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration has reported a scalar spectral index $ n_s~=~0.9743~\pm~0.0034 $. This is substantially larger than the classical prediction of non-minimally coupled inflation models such as Higgs Inflation, $n_s \approx 0.965$. Here we revisit the unitarity-conserving non-minimally coupled inflation model proposed in [1]. We show that when the inflaton is a complex non-minimally coupled gauge singlet scalar with additional interactions in the Jordan frame to maintain unitarity, the model predicts $n_s = 0.9730$ and $r \approx 9 \times 10^{-6}$ for scalar self-coupling $\lambda = 0.1$.",

We clarify the characteristics of the gravitational wave signal in this specific situation and underline some unexpected features. A phenomenological approximation for the radiated power is given. We derive the shape and peaking frequency of the associated stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves for both electrons and protons, either of galactic or extra-galactic origin.",
Cross submissions,Microphysical Origins of Gravitational Potentials in Astrophysical Systems,Meir Shimon,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Most astrophysical systems (except for very compact objects such as, e.g., black holes and neutron stars) in our universe are characterized by shallow gravitational potentials, with dimensionless compactness parameter. While the existence and characteristic scales of such virialized systems depend on gravity, we demonstrate that the value of the compactness -- and thus the non-relativistic nature of most astrophysical objects -- arises from microphysical parameters, specifically the fine structure constant and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and is fundamentally independent of the gravitational constant G. It then follows that large-scale astrophysical velocities and escape velocities associated with virialized systems are determined by electromagnetic and atomic physics, not by gravitation, and that the compactness is always set by microphysical scales -- even for the most compact objects, such as neutron stars, where the compactness is determined by quantities like the pion-to-proton mass ratio. This observation, largely overlooked in the literature, explains why the universe is not dominated by relativistic, compact objects and connects the low entropy of the observable universe to underlying microphysics. Our results emphasize the central but underappreciated role played by dimensionless microphysical constants in shaping the macroscopic gravitational landscape of the universe. In particular, we clarify that this independence of compactness from G applies specifically to entire, virialized, naturally formed astrophysical systems -- such as stars, galaxies, and planets -- that have reached equilibrium through self-gravity and microphysical processes. In contrast, arbitrary non-virialized subsystems (e.g., a piece cut from a planet) do not exhibit this property.",
