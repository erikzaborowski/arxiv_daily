New submissions,"The Wrath of KAN: Enabling Fast, Accurate, and Transparent Emulation of the Global 21 cm Cosmology Signal","J. Dorigo Jones,B. Reyes,D. Rapetti,Shah Mohammad Bahauddin,J. O. Burns,D. W. Barker",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we present a novel emulator of the global 21 cm cosmology signal, $\texttt{21cmKAN}$, that provides extremely fast training speed while achieving nearly equivalent accuracy to the most accurate emulator to date, $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$. The combination of enhanced speed and accuracy facilitated by $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ enables rapid and highly accurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 21 cm models, which is needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and produce robust constraints on the early universe. Rather than using static functions to model complex relationships like traditional fully-connected neural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform significantly better for low-dimensional physical problems. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ predicts a given signal for two well-known models in the community in 3.7 ms on average and trains about 75 times faster than $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$, when utilizing the same typical GPU. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ is able to achieve these speeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its relatively small number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We show that $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ required less than 30 minutes to train and fit these simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find that the transparent architecture of $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ allows us to conveniently interpret and further validate its emulation results in terms of the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of KANs and their ability to more quickly and accurately mimic expensive physical simulations in comparison to other types of neural networks.",
New submissions,Where does non-Universality in Assembly Bias come from?,"Charuhas Shiveshwarkar,Marilena Loverde,Christopher M. Hirata,Drew Jamieson",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity (LPnG) obtained from galaxy power spectra are limited by the perfect degeneracy between the LPnG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the bias parameter $b_{\phi}$ which encodes the response of galaxy clustering to a change in the amplitude of primordial curvature fluctuations. For galaxies observed by galaxy surveys, the relation between $b_{\phi}$ and the galaxy bias $b_{g}$ is poorly understood and differs significantly from the universal mass function ansatz. In this paper, we investigate this non-universality in the context of dark-matter halos using the Separate Universe framework, focussing on dark-matter halos selected by mass and/or concentration. We show that the Separate Universe framework provides a natural explanation of the observed universality in the bias of dark-matter halos selected purely by their mass, independent of the spherical collapse picture of halo formation. We further propose an explanation for the observed non-universality in halos selected by concentration and corroborate it with $N$-body simulations in scale-free (EdS) and $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ cosmologies. In particular, we show that the relation between $b_{\phi}$ and halo bias $b_{h}$ for halos selected by concentration in matter-dominated cosmologies tends towards universality at the highest halo masses due to such halos gravitationally dominating their environment throughout their evolution. We also argue that concentration-selected halos of lower masses exhibit non-universality due to their mass accretion being significantly affected by the gravitational influence of neighbouring, more massive halos. Our results suggest that any non-universality in high redshift ($z\gtrsim 3$), high-bias objects observed by realistic galaxy surveys is entirely an artifact of the associated selection function.",
New submissions,Frequentist Cosmological Constraints from Full-Shape Clustering Measurements in DESI DR1,"James Morawetz,Hanyu Zhang,Marco Bonici,Will Percival,Andrea Crespi,Jessica Nicole Aguilar,Steven Ahlen,Davide Bianchi,David Brooks,Francisco Javier Castander,Todd Claybaugh,Shaun Cole,Andrei Cuceu,Axel de la Macorra,Arnaud de Mattia,Biprateep Dey,Peter Doel,Simone Ferraro,Andreu Font-Ribera,Jaime E.

While Bayesian inferences for Effective Field Theory models of galaxy clustering can be highly sensitive to the choice of priors for extended cosmological models, frequentist inferences are not susceptible to such effects. We compare Bayesian and frequentist constraints for the parameter set $\{\sigma_8, H_0, \Omega_{\rm{m}}, w_0, w_a\}$ when fitting to the full-shape of the power spectrum multipoles, the post-reconstruction Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, as well as external datasets from the CMB and type Ia supernovae measurements. Bayesian prior effects are very significant for the $w_0w_a$CDM model; while the $1 \sigma$ frequentist confidence intervals encompass the maximum a posteriori (MAP), the Bayesian credible intervals almost always exclude the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the MAP - indicating strong prior volume projection effects - unless supernovae data are included. We observe limited prior effects for the $\Lambda$CDM model, due to the reduced number of parameters. When DESI full-shape and BAO data are jointly fit, we obtain the following $1\sigma$ frequentist confidence intervals for $\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM): $\sigma_8 = 0.867^{+0.048}_{-0.041} , \ H_0 = 68.91^{+0.80}_{-0.79} \ \rm{km \ s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}} , \ \Omega_{\rm{m}} = 0.3038\pm0.0110$ ($\sigma_8 = 0.793^{+0.069}_{-0.048} , \ H_0 = 64.9^{+4.8}_{-2.8} \ \rm{km \ s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}} , \ \Omega_{\rm{m}} = 0.369^{+0.029}_{-0.059}$ , $w_0 = -0.24^{+0.17}_{-0.64}$ , $w_a = -2.5^{+1.9}_{}$), corresponding to 0.7$\sigma$, 0.3$\sigma$, 0.7$\sigma$ (1.9$\sigma$, 3.4$\sigma$, 5.6$\sigma$, 5.5$\sigma$, 5.6$\sigma$) shifts between the MLE relative to the Bayesian posterior mean for $\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM) respectively.",
New submissions,Mitigating point-source contamination in CMB polarization: a Generalized Point Spread Function fitting approach,"Yi-ming Wang,Wen-Zheng Chen,Yang Liu,Si-Yu Li,Hong Li",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode polarization provide a way to probe primordial gravitational waves and test inflationary predictions. Extragalactic point sources become a major source of contamination after delensing and can bias estimates of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ at the $10^{-3}$ level. We introduce Generalized Point Spread Function Fitting (GPSF), a method for removing point-source contamination in polarization maps. GPSF uses the full pixel-domain covariance, including off-diagonal terms, and models overlapping sources. This allows accurate flux estimation under realistic conditions, particularly for small-aperture telescopes with large beams that are more susceptible to source blending. We test GPSF on simulated sky maps, apply foreground cleaning using the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) method, and compare its performance with standard masking and inpainting. The results show GPSF reduces point-source contamination without significantly affecting the background signal, as seen in both the maps and their power spectra. For the constraint on $r$, GPSF reduces the bias from $1.67 \times 10^{-3}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{-4}$, with only a 2% increase in standard deviation. Compared to inpainting and masking, GPSF yields lower bias while maintaining comparable variance. This suggests that it may serve as a promising method for future CMB experiments targeting measurements of $r \sim 10^{-3}$.",
New submissions,Cosmology-informed Neural Networks to infer dark energy equation-of-state,"Anshul Verma,Shashwat Sourav,Pavan K. Aluri,David F. Mota",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference to constrain dynamical dark energy models using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation. First, we train a physics-informed neural network to learn the solution of the Friedmann equation and accurately reproduce the matter density term x_m(z) = Omega_m,0 (1+z)^3 across a range of Omega_m,0. For each of five two-parameter equation-of-state (EoS) forms: Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Linear-z, and Logarithmic-z, we derive the analytic dark energy factor x_de(z), embed the trained surrogate within a GPU-accelerated likelihood pipeline, and sample the posterior of (h0, Omega_m,0, w0, wa, M0) using the emcee ensemble sampler with the full Pantheon+ covariance. All parameterizations remain consistent with a cosmological constant (w0 = -1, wa = 0) at the 95% credible level, with the tightest bounds from the CPL form. While the surrogate does not reduce computation time for a single run in simple models, it becomes advantageous for repeated analyses of the same EoS or for models with expensive likelihood evaluations, and can be shared as a reusable tool with different datasets within the training range of SNe redshifts. This flexibility makes the approach a scalable tool for future cosmological inference, especially in regimes where conventional ODE-based methods are computationally prohibitive.",
New submissions,How the cosmic voids contribute to stalling and quenching the giant galaxies on their surfaces,"Geonwoo Kang,Jounghun Lee(Seoul National University)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We report a numerical discovery that the formations of cosmic voids are closely linked with the mechanism through which the giant galaxies on void surfaces establish elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder algorithm, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\star}\ge 10^{10.5}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\star}$-controlled samples according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found that the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases that the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the analytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local tidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due to the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial infall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant void-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of cosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also discuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface galaxies as a probe of dark energy.",
New submissions,Group Therapy for Halos: Advancing Halo Mass Estimation for Galaxy Groups,"Welsey Van Kempen,Michelle E. Cluver,Edward N. Taylor,Darren J. Croton,Trystan S. Lambert,Claudia del P. Lagos",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ = 0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended for GAMA-like surveys (i < 19.2) at z < 0.1 where minimal model dependence is required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates across diverse catalogues with limits of z < 0.3. These calibrated estimators will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.",
New submissions,SMILES Data Release II: Probing Galaxy Evolution during Cosmic Noon and Beyond with NIRSpec Medium-Resolution Spectra,"Yongda Zhu,Nina Bonaventura,Yang Sun,George H. Rieke,Stacey Alberts,Jianwei Lyu,Jane E. Morrison,Zhiyuan Ji,Eiichi Egami,Jakob M. Helton,Marcia J. Rieke,Pierluigi Rinaldi,Fengwu Sun,Christopher N. A. Willmer",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning $0 < z < 7.5$, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon ($z \sim 1$-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with \texttt{GELATO} for emission-line galaxies and \texttt{pPXF} fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.",
New submissions,A 15 Mpc rotating galaxy filament at redshift z = 0.032,"Madalina N. Tudorache,S. L. Jung,M. J. Jarvis,I. Heywood,A. A. Ponomareva,A. Varasteanu,N. Maddox,T. Yasin,M. Glowacki",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Understanding the cold atomic hydrogen gas (HI) within cosmic filaments has the potential to pin down the relationship between the low density gas in the cosmic web and how the galaxies that lie within it grow using this material. We report the discovery of a cosmic filament using 14 HI-selected galaxies that form a very thin elongated structure of 1.7 Mpc. These galaxies are embedded within a much larger cosmic web filament, traced by optical galaxies, that spans at least $\sim 15$~Mpc. We find that the spin axes of the HI galaxies are significantly more strongly aligned with the cosmic web filament ($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.64 \pm 0.05$) than cosmological simulations predict, with the optically-selected galaxies showing alignment to a lesser degree ($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.55 \pm 0.05$). This structure demonstrates that within the cosmic filament, the angular momentum of galaxies is closely connected to the large-scale filamentary structure. We also find strong evidence that the galaxies are orbiting around the spine of the filament, making this one of the largest rotating structures discovered thus far, and from which we can infer that there is transfer of angular momentum from the filament to the individual galaxies. The abundance of HI galaxies along the filament and the low dynamical temperature of the galaxies within the filament indicates that this filament is at an early evolutionary stage where the imprint of cosmic matter flow on galaxies has been preserved over cosmic time.",
Cross submissions,Impact of Non-Thermal Leptogenesis from Early Matter Domination on Gravitational Wave from FOPT,"Dilip Kumar Ghosh,Anish Ghoshal,Koustav Mukherjee,Nimmala Narendra,Nobuchika Okada",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study the impact of non-thermal leptogenesis on the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by a strong first-order phase transition in the early Universe. We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field, $\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a lepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\phi$-dominated era and the entropy injection from the decays of $\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on the GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that distinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the parameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to distinctive GW spectral features. We show that these GW signals can fall within the sensitivity ranges of future detectors such as ET, DECIGO and BBO. If observed, they would provide valuable insights into the thermal history and dynamics of the early Universe.",
Cross submissions,A New Paradigm for Testing Gravity: Theory-Independent Constraints Using Data From All Astrophysical and Cosmological Scales,"Daniel B Thomas,Theodore Anton,Timothy Clifton",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Testing General Relativity (GR) is a key science goal of much of modern physics, and usually results in constraints that are either theory or context specific. We present an holistic framework that we dub `Parametrized Post-Newtonian Cosmology' (PPNC), which can be used for obtaining theory-agnostic constraints on deviations from GR using a single unified set of parameters that apply on all astrophysical and cosmological scales. Our approach is based on the formalism and philosophy of the highly successful Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework, but allows us to combine observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) with Solar System observations of the Cassini probe and ephemeris of Mars. The full combination of these data sets constrains average deviations from GR over the history of the Universe to be less than $\sim 10\%$, with PPNC parameter values $\bar{\alpha}=0.97^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and $\bar{\gamma}=0.97^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ at the $68\%$ confidence level (GR corresponds to $\bar{\alpha}=\bar{\gamma}=1$). We find that these gravitational parameters have a strong mutual degeneracy, and are constrained to be within $1\%$ of each other for all of cosmic history. Our results demonstrate the ability of the PPNC framework to combine astrophysical, Solar System and cosmological tests of gravity into a single set of unified constraints. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for upcoming missions in both cosmology and astrophysics, which ultimately seek to constrain the same underlying gravitational interaction.",
Cross submissions,Spacetime Perspective of Gravitational Lensing in Perturbed Cosmologies,"Thomas P. Kling,Sophia MacQueen Pooler",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We develop the spacetime approach to gravitational lensing by spherically symmetric perturbations of flat, cosmological constant-dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker metrics. The geodesics of the spacetime are expressed as integral expressions which are used to examine the formation of multiple images and the observed shapes of non-point sources. We develop the lens mapping from the spacetime perspective, and use the Jacobian of the mapping to explain the observed image shapes. Approaching the geodesic equations as ordinary differential equations, we demonstrate the development of wave front singularities and time delays between light ray signals. This work demonstrates that the widely used thin lens approximation can be replaced with more robust techniques aligned with general relativity.",
Cross submissions,High-Energy Neutrinos from Cosmic-Ray Scatterings with Supernova Neutrinos,"Gonzalo Herrera,Shunsaku Horiuchi",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Cosmic rays scattering with neutrinos produced in supernovae induce a flux of supernova neutrinos boosted to high energies. We calculate the neutrino flux arising from this new mechanism in environments with large cosmic-ray and supernova densities, such as some Active Galactic Nuclei. Under plausible astrophysical conditions, this flux may be detectable with high-energy neutrino telescopes, just considering the proton-neutrino scattering cross section expected in the Standard Model. Furthermore, the center of mass energy of such scatterings can reach $ \sqrt{s} \sim 10-100$ TeV, where the proton-neutrino cross section may be enhanced by new physics such as extra-dimensional theories. The boosted neutrino signal benefits from such an enhancement in the cross section not only at the detection point on Earth, but also at production in astrophysical sources, which allows us to set novel constraints on the ultra-high energy proton-neutrino cross section with neutrino telescopes.",
Cross submissions,Completing Axion Double Level Crossings,"Hai-Jun Li,Wei Chao,Huai-Ke Guo,Yu-Feng Zhou",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we present the refinement of axion double level crossings within the context of multi-axion mass mixing, specifically focusing on cases where the number of axions exceeds two. Our investigation reveals that double level crossings are a common phenomenon in the mass mixing of the $Z_{\mathcal N}$ axion and axion-like particles. We introduce the general model for double level crossings, along with several toy examples, and redefine the light and heavy axion scenarios. In the light axion scenario, double level crossings can occur multiple times in the large ${\mathcal N}$ limit. However, excessively large values of ${\mathcal N}$ may also prevent the occurrence of double level crossings. Conversely, in the heavy axion scenario, excessively small ${\mathcal N}$ may similarly prevent their occurrence. Our findings also have some intriguing implications for axion cosmology.",
