New submissions,Progress in Particle Physics and Modern Cosmology,A.D. Dolgov,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This is the translation into English of my paper published in Russian at the paper collection on cosmology at \\ 1981. The content of the book is presented in the Appendix. This is the first paper where the dynamical mechanism of phoenix universe was worked out. The notion of phoenix universe was first mentioned in the paper by Lemaitre in 1933, where he assumed that a repetition of successive phases of expansion and contraction was possible. Lemaitre called such model of the universe, that is born, dies and is reborn, the phoenix model, named after the mythical bird able to reborn from the ashes. According to the author, there could be an infinite number of such cycles in the past and future. In this model, however, a possible solution to the fundamental question was unclear, what was the mechanism for the rebirth of the universe. This mechanism was worked out in my paper, published in 1980 in Russian. Moreover, in our recent paper with E. Arbuzova a mechanism of dynamical cancellation of vacuum energy was proposed, that permits to eliminate vacuum energy locally down to zero and permits universe to jump to a lower hot level, leading to rebirth of a hot universe.",
New submissions,Studying dark gaps in Ly-$α$ forest transmission with large reionization simulation,"Barun Maity,Frederick B. Davies,Benedetta Spina,Sarah E. I. Bosman",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The physical conditions of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the final stages of cosmic reionization ($z\sim5.0-6.0$) are not yet fully understood. Recent reports of unexpectedly large-scale ($\ge 150 h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$) correlation in Ly-$\alpha$ transmission flux using extended XQR-30 quasar spectra pose interesting consequences on the reionization end stages. In this work, we investigate the Ly-$\alpha$ forest dark-gap distribution (defined as regions with transmitted flux below 0.05) as another sensitive tracer of the IGM, using an efficient, large-volume ($\sim 1 ~\mathrm{Gpc}$) simulation framework. By constructing a suite of physically motivated model variants (i.e, varying the reionization redshift, IGM temperature, and ionizing-photon mean free path), we generate synthetic sightlines and compare their predicted cumulative distribution of dark gaps with that of observed spectra (at redshift intervals of $\Delta z=0.2$). We find that most of the models achieve qualitatively consistent agreement with the data. Specifically, the scenario involving a slightly later reionization completion ($z\sim 5.4$) provides the closest match, while a short constant mean free path model disfavors the data at lower redshifts. These findings give further support for the emerging scenario of reionization end extending to $z\le5.7$, although they can not rule out a slightly early reionization with enhanced post-ionization ultraviolet (UV) background fluctuations. A similar conclusion arises from the redshift distribution of long dark gap ($L\ge 30 ~h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$) fraction. However, the model variants are still not able to reproduce the observed strong flux correlations at unusually large scales, which remains open for further investigations.",
New submissions,Cosmological Dynamics of Multi-Axion Quintessence,"Supakorn Katewongveerachart,David J. E. Marsh",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"One fundamental physics interpretation of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results is that the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe is driven not by the cosmological constant, but by a slowly rolling scalar field, a natural model for which is an axion with a decay constant close to the Planck scale. In the ``string axiverse'' one expects not one, but many, axions and this may allow the ability to engineer large effective decay constants. We thus investigate dark energy dynamics in a toy model with two axions, and compute the prior probability for the dark energy equation of state parameters $(w_0,w_a)$ implied by priors on the fundamental parameters of the model conditioned weakly on the resulting cosmology. We find various interesting behaviours, for example where both fields can be in an oscillating regime while maintaining $w_0<-1/3$, and models with opposite sign for $w_a$ than in a single-field model. The prior probability in $(w_0,w_a)$ gains support away from the ``thawing quintessence'' behaviour preferred by DESI, and when the axions have cross-interactions this effect becomes stronger. When the axions interact, one in general still requires large decay constants, but if the axions are non-interacting the largest decay constant can be reduced. The novel equations of state we illustrate may also be of relevance to models of early dark energy or inflation/reheating with mutliple axions. Further exploration of dynamics in models with $N\gg 1$ axions is warranted.",
New submissions,Skewness in the Hellings-Downs curve,"Ryosuke Fujimoto,Keitaro Takahashi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent Pulsar Timing Array datasets provide compelling evidence for a nano-Hertz gravitational-wave background, but robust detection requires characterizing statistical fluctuations of the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation expected from a finite population of discrete sources. Building on the variance calculation of Allen (2023), we derive the third central moment (skewness) of the HD correlation for a single unpolarized point source and an ensemble of many interfering point sources in the confusion-noise regime. To isolate the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the background, we extend the pulsar-averaging formalism to third order by introducing a three-point averaged correlation function, which allows us to define the cosmic skewness. We find that the skewness remains non-zero in the large-source-number limit and is controlled by a new geometric three-point function. These results suggest that incorporating higher-order moments could provide additional information on source discreteness beyond standard Gaussian analyses.",
New submissions,Wigner Function Shapelets I : formalism,Shun Arai,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We extend shapelets for the analysis of galaxy images to be available in a phase space, introducing \textit{Wigner Function Shapelets (WFS)}. Whereas conventional shapelets expand images separately in configuration or Fourier space using Hermite-Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian modes, WFS represents images directly in the four-dimensional phase space with symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$, which is quantised by a phase-space cell $2\pi\lambdabar$ that determines a resolution limit of a telescope. WFS consists of a bilinear form of the cross-Wigner function of the Laguerre-Gaussian modes as an orthogonal and complete basis for the Wigner function of an image, carrying out $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ irreducible representations of the phase space with the Hopf tori. We introduce a scalar function $\mathcal{W}_{k\ell} (Q_0,Q_2)$ from the $\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{U}(1)$ - covariant tori to a two-dimensional space of constants of motion $(Q_0,Q_2)$ -- the harmonic energy and axial angular momentum -- thereby yielding a natural phase-space ``band structure'', given a pair of winding number $(k,\ell) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$. %
WFS leverage key properties of the Wigner function for image analysis: (i) it encodes full information of an image in a symmetry-preserving way; (ii) its trasport equation naturally involves with a Liouville equation at $\lambdabar \rightarrow 0$; (iii) it admits positive/negative oscillatory patterns on $(Q_0,Q_2)$ plane that can be sensitive spatial coherent structure of galaxy morphology and cosmological imprints; and (iv) systematics and noise can be manipulated as a quantum channel operation. This paper aims to bring all the formulae related to the Wigner function in the context of astrophysics and cosmology, formally organising in both terminologies of astronomy and of quantum information theory.",
New submissions,Detectability and Model Discriminability of the Dark Ages 21 cm Global Signal,"Shintaro Yoshiura,Fumiya Okamatsu,Tomo Takahashi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen atom is almost the only way to directly probe the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages 21 cm signal, observed at frequencies below 50 MHz, can serve as a powerful probe of cosmology, as the standard cosmological model predicts a well-defined 21 cm spectral shape. In this work, we assess the detectability and model-selection power of 21 cm observations assuming physically motivated foregrounds, optimistic error levels, and several observing strategies for the signals predicted in various cosmological models. Using a Bayesian evidence-based comparison, we find that wide-band observations covering 1-50 MHz can identify the evidence of non-zero 21 cm signals from models considered in this paper except the one with a smooth spectrum that peaks at lower frequencies. In particular, observations below 15 MHz are essential to avoid degeneracies with the foreground. Furthermore, even with observations measured at 5 MHz intervals over the frequency range 1-50 MHz, the 21 cm signal can be identified if the errors are sufficiently small. This indicates that the intrinsic 21 cm spectral shape can be captured without foreground degeneracy even with a limited number of frequency channels.",
New submissions,Factorized neural posterior estimation for rapid and reliable inference of parameterized post-Einsteinian deviation parameters in gravitational waves,"Yong-Xin Zhang,Tian-Yang Sun,Chun-Yu Xiong,Song-Tao Liu,Yu-Xin Wang,Shang-Jie Jin,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO has strikingly confirmed general relativity (GR), but testing GR via GWs requires estimating parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) deviation parameters in waveform models. Traditional Bayesian inference methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provide reliable estimates but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, failing to meet the real-time demands and surging data volume of future GW detectors. Here, we propose a factorized neural posterior estimation framework: we construct independent normalizing flow models for each of the nine ppE deviation parameters and effectively integrate prior information from other source parameters via a conditional embedding network. Leveraging a hybrid neural network with a convolutional neural network and a Residual Neural Network for feature extraction, our method performs rapid and statistically reliable posterior inference directly from binary black hole signals. Compared to conventional MCMC, our approach achieves millisecond-scale inference time with a speedup factor of $9 \times 10^4$. Comprehensive validations show that the posterior estimates pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and achieve empirical coverage probabilities close to theoretical targets. This work demonstrates the great potential of deep learning for GW parameter estimation and provides a viable technical solution for real-time GR tests with next-generation detectors.",
New submissions,A Variable-Slope Smooth-$k$ Filter for Modeling Halo Abundances with Damped and Oscillatory Power Spectra,Andreu Rocamora Martorell,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We introduce a variable-slope smooth-$k$ (VSMK) filter within the Press-Schechter formalism to model halo mass functions derived from damped and oscillatory matter power spectra. While the standard smooth-$k$ approach successfully captures small-scale suppression effects, it intrinsically couples these to oscillatory features at intermediate scales. The VSMK filter generalizes this framework by allowing the effective logarithmic slope of the $k$-space window function to vary smoothly between two asymptotic regimes, thereby decoupling the small-scale suppression of halo abundances from the intermediate-scale oscillatory features characteristic of dark acoustic oscillations. We compare the analytic predictions obtained with the VSMK filter to $N$-body simulations for warm dark matter and ETHOS-based models, showing that a single parameter set reproduces both regimes simultaneously. The VSMK filter thus provides a unified and flexible analytic framework for modeling halo abundances in non-cold dark matter scenarios with damped and oscillatory power spectra.",
New submissions,A single field inflationary potential consistent with recent observations,Md. Wali Hossain,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Current observations indicate that an inverse exponential form of the inflaton potential provides an excellent description of single-field inflation. This potential fits the SPA$+$BK$+$DESI data sets well with in the $1\sigma$ bound in the $n_{\rm s}$-$r$ plane, thereby offering a simple and observationally viable single field inflationary scenario. To describe post-inflationary evolution and reheating, we extend the inverse exponential potential by adding a steep exponential term that remains negligible during inflation but becomes important afterwards. The resulting full potential develops a minimum after the end of inflation, leading to oscillations of the scalar field and consequently reheating of the Universe. We find that the maximum reheating temperature attainable in this scenario is of order $10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. The inverse exponential potential therefore emerges as a compelling candidate for early-Universe inflation, combining theoretical simplicity with robust observational viability.",
New submissions,Resonant production of heavy particles during inflation and its gravitational wave signature,"Qi Chen,Yuan Yin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We show that a quadratic $U(1)$-breaking term, together with an effective chemical potential induced by a dimension five derivative coupling between the inflaton and the $U(1)$ current, can drive efficient particle production during inflation even when the $U(1)$ field is heavier than the Hubble scale. Notably, the chemical potential enables efficient production even when the $U(1)$-breaking mass is smaller than the effective diagonal mass. We compute the gravitational wave signal generated by this mechanism during inflation, derive the primordial tensor spectrum, and map it to the present day energy density $\Omega_{\mathrm GW}(f)$. Assuming the $U(1)$ field constitutes the dominant component of dark matter, this mapping fixes the characteristic frequency, which we compare with projected sensitivity curves of ongoing and proposed gravitational wave observatories. Finally, we argue that the same dynamics are accompanied by a cosmological collider signal, providing an independent cross validation of the framework.",
New submissions,Partial Relief of the Hubble Tension and a Natural Self-Interacting Dark Matter Candidate From Staged Symmetry Breaking,"Zachary J. Hoelscher,Thomas W. Kephart,Robert J. Scherrer,Kelly-Holley Bockelmann",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The values of the Hubble constant ($\rm{H_0}$) inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and local measurements via the distance ladder exhibit a $\sim5\sigma$ tension. In this work we propose that the tension might be partially alleviated if a subcomponent of the dark matter undergoes decays triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking in the dark sector, so that the equation of state parameter of the subcomponent shifts from $w \approx 0$ at early times to $w \approx -1/3$ at late times. We provide an effective field theory whose structure is partially motivated by the desire for a plausible UV completion. We find that such a construction naturally produces a possible self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent scattering cross section as a by-product of gauge invariance. This is relevant for addressing tensions between the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, such as the core-cusp problem.",
New submissions,Bounds on the Tsallis Parameter from a deformed Neutrino Sector in the Early Universe,Matias P. Gonzalez,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),We generalize neutrino energy density content in the early universe near BBN era $T\simeq1$ MeV within Tsallis nonextensive statistics. By using Curado-Tsallis constraints we obtain generalized distribution functions $f_q(E)$. We compute the generalized thermodynamic integral for the energy density $\rho_q$. We define a reescaling $R^{(\xi = +1)}_{\rho}(q) = \rho_q/\rho^{\rm std}$ which is a ratio between the deformed energy density and the standard extensive case. The last was used to directly map and deform neutrino content via the effective number of neutrinos $N_{\rm eff}$. The deformation prediction was confronted against CMB$+$BAO and BBN data for $N_{\rm eff}$ by a joint/combined $\chi^2$ type-fit. We obtained the constraints $|q-1|\le 1.09\times 10^{-2}$ (95\% CL) and $|q-1|\le 1.32\times 10^{-2}$ (99\% CL) from the combined analysis by numerically calculating the best value of the Tsallis parameter $q_{\rm best}$.,
New submissions,Simulation-based cosmological inference from optically-selected galaxy clusters with $\texttt{Capish}$,"Constantin Payerne,Calum Murray,Hugo Simon",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxy clusters are powerful probes of the growth of cosmic structure through measurements of their abundance as a function of mass and redshift. Extracting precise cosmological constraints from cluster surveys is challenging, as we must contend the complex relationship between richness and the underlying halo mass, selection function biases, super-sample covariance, and correlated measurement noise between mass proxies. As upcoming photometric surveys are expected to detect tens to hundreds of thousands of galaxy clusters, controlling these systematics becomes essential. In this paper, we present a forward-modelling approach using Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), which provides a natural framework for jointly modelling cluster abundance and lensing mass observables while capturing systematic uncertainties at higher fidelity than analytic likelihood methods - which rely on simplifying assumptions such as fixed covariances and Gaussianity - without requiring an explicit likelihood formulation. We introduce $\texttt{Capish}$, a Python code for generating forward-modelled galaxy cluster catalogues using halo mass functions and incorporating observational effects. We perform SBI using neural density estimation with normalizing flows, trained on abundance and mean lensing mass measurements in observed redshift-richness bins. Our forward model accounts for realistic noise, redshift uncertainties, selection functions, and correlated scatter between lensing mass and observed richness. We find good agreement with likelihood-based analyses, with broader SBI posteriors reflecting the increased realism of the forward model. We also test $\texttt{Capish}$ on cluster catalogues built from a large cosmological simulation, finding a good fit to cosmological parameters.",
New submissions,Clustering of emission line galaxies with IllustrisTNG -- II. cosmology challenge with anisotropic correlation functions and ELG-halo connections,"Ken Osato,Teppei Okumura",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Emission line galaxies (ELGs) are the primary tracers of the large-scale structures of the Universe in ongoing Stage-IV cosmological spectroscopic surveys, which aim to measure the clustering statistics at higher redshifts $z \simeq 1.5 \text{--} 2$ with unprecedented precision. In this study, we construct realistic mock ELG samples with IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations and stellar population synthesis framework. In order to validate the modelling of clustering, we measure the anisotropic correlation functions of mock ELGs and infer the linear growth rate, which is one of key cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering. As a control sample, we construct the mass-limited subhalo samples with the same number density as ELGs. The isotropic correlation functions in real space for both samples do not differ significantly. However, the quadrupole moment of the anisotropic correlation function, which is sensitive to the velocity of galaxies, is suppressed for ELGs, potentially due to the infalling motion of ELGs towards the centre of the hosting halos. The smaller amplitude leads to the underestimation of the linear growth rate and implies the velocity bias between ELGs and dark matter. When the analysis is limited to large scales $(\gtrsim 15 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc})$, the parameter bias vanishes. Next, we investigate the ELG-halo connection through the phase-space distribution of satellite ELGs within hosting halos and galactic conformity of star formation activity. The infalling motion is further confirmed by the phase-space distribution relative to the host halo, and this dynamics of ELGs challenges the assumption that the radial distribution of satellites follows that of dark matter.",
New submissions,Negentropy as Diagnostic of Cosmic Density Fields and Dynamical Dark Energy Models,Suman Sarkar,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We employ negentropy ($J$), defined as the difference between the information content of a non-Gaussian probability distribution and a Gaussian with identical variance, as an information-theoretic probe of non-Gaussianity in the cosmic density field. We quantify its sensitivity to dynamical dark energy by studying the evolution of $J(a)$ and its derivatives $\Gamma_1(a)$ and $\Gamma_2(a)$ across three parameterisation schemes: CPL, JBP, and BA. We determine the characteristic redshift $z_{NG}$, marking the epoch of maximal non-Gaussian structure formation, and the turnaround redshift $z_{TA}$, when information production transitions due to dark-energy domination, finding $z_{NG}\sim0.81$ and $z_{TA}\sim0.18$ for $\Lambda$CDM. Our diagnostics clearly discriminate between thawing and freezing quintessence models and phantom dark energy at low redshifts. Thawing models show small departures from $\Lambda$CDM, freezing models display higher $z_{TA}$, while phantom models exhibit lower $z_{TA}$, reflecting late-time evolution. We provide a practical prescription for measuring negentropy from discrete galaxy distributions, establishing a framework that can be applied to simulations and observations. This information-theoretic approach offers a robust and complementary tool for probing dark energy dynamics, enabling sensitive discrimination between evolving and cosmological-constant scenarios.",
New submissions,Reconstructing the largest scales of the Universe with field-level inference applied to the Quaia Quasar Catalogue,"Adam Andrews,Arthur Loureiro,Jens Jasche,Stuart McAlpine,Guilhem Lavaux,Florent Leclercq",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The recently released Quaia quasar catalogue, with its broad redshift range and all-sky coverage, enables unprecedented three-dimensional reconstructions of matter across cosmic time. In this work, we apply the field-level inference algorithm BORG to the Quaia catalogues to reconstruct the initial conditions and present-day matter distribution of the Universe. We employ a physics-based forward model of large-scale structure using Lagrangian perturbation theory, incorporating light-cone effects, redshift-space distortions, quasar bias, and survey selection effects. This approach enables a detailed and physically motivated inference of the three-dimensional density field and initial conditions over the entire cosmic volume considered. We analyse both the G < 20.0 (Quaia Clean) and G < 20.5 (Quaia Deep) samples, where G denotes the Gaia broad optical-band magnitude, imposing conservative sky cuts to ensure robustness against foreground contamination. The resulting reconstructions span a comoving volume of (10h^{-1} Gpc)^3 with a maximum spatial resolution of 39.1 h^{-1}Mpc, making this the largest field-level reconstruction of the observable Universe in terms of comoving volume to date. We validate our reconstructions through a range of internal and external consistency checks, including the cross-correlation of the inferred density fields with Planck CMB lensing, where we detect a signal at ~4\sigma significance. Beyond delivering high-fidelity data products, including posterior maps of initial conditions, present-day dark matter, and velocity fields, this work establishes a framework for exploiting quasar surveys in field-level cosmology.",
New submissions,Evaluating the Contribution of Active Galactic Nuclei to the Diffuse High-Energy Neutrino Flux,"Samyak Jain,Dan Hooper,Francis Halzen",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The detection of high-energy neutrinos from NGC 1068 and TXS-0506+56 suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) may contribute significantly to the the diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube. Using 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, we performed a systematic population analysis of X-ray-bright and gamma-ray-bright AGN to evaluate the extent to which this diffuse flux could originate from these sources. We find that gamma-ray-bright blazars can account for no more than 16\% of IceCube's total diffuse flux. Although we find no evidence of neutrino emission from gamma-ray-bright, non-blazar AGN, we cannot exclude the possibility that these sources contribute significantly to the diffuse flux. In contrast, we report (pre-trials) evidence of neutrino emission from several nearby, X-ray-bright, Seyfert-type AGN, including \mbox{NGC 1068} ($4.9\sigma$), SWIFT J1041.4-1740 ($2.6\sigma$), SWIFT J0202.4+6824A/B ($2.6\sigma$), SWIFT J0744.0+2914 (2.6$\sigma$), NGC 4151 ($2.5\sigma$), and NGC 3079 ($2.5\sigma$). Although not fully conclusive, these results suggest that IceCube may be detecting neutrinos from a larger population of Seyfert galaxies. The fact that these sources are not gamma-ray bright indicates that their neutrino production must be taking place in optically thick environments, such as in the coronae surrounding these galaxies' supermassive black holes. We also identify a $4.2\sigma$ correlation between the neutrinos detected by IceCube and members of the Swift-BAT catalog of X-ray-bright AGN, although this correlation is dominated by NGC 1068. We estimate that this class of sources contributes between 11.2\% and the entirety of IceCube's total diffuse neutrino flux. These results strengthen the emerging case for the prevalence of gamma-ray-obscured AGN as significant sources of high-energy neutrinos.",

Vielva",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Although half-wave plates (HWPs) are becoming a popular choice of polarization modulators for cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, their non-idealities can introduce systematic effects that should be carefully characterized and mitigated. One possible mitigation strategy is to incorporate information about the non-idealities at the map-making level, which helps to reduce the HWP-induced distortions of the reconstructed CMB. Nevertheless, the non-idealities can only be known with finite precision. In this paper we investigate the consequences of discrepancies between their true frequency profiles and those assumed by the map-maker. We present an end-to-end framework, including a blind component-separation step, and use it to translate these discrepancies into a bias on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, for the LiteBIRD satellite mission. We subsequently derive realistic and conservative measurement requirements for accurately characterizing the HWP non-idealities to ensure they do not compromise LiteBIRD's ambitious scientific goals. We find that the obtained results are robust against sky models with varying complexity.",
New submissions,The FLAMINGO Project: Exploring the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation as a probe of large-scale structure,"William McDonald,Joop Schaye,Konrad Kuijken,John Helly,Joey Braspenning,Matthieu Schaller",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Baryonic feedback processes associated with galaxy formation directly influence the large-scale structure by redistributing gas. Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\leq M_{200\mathrm{c}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.",
Cross submissions,Reheating in geometric Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity,Ioannis D. Gialamas,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study Weyl-invariant purely gravitational theories formulated within the Einstein-Cartan framework. In the Einstein-frame description, these models are dynamically equivalent to standard general relativity coupled to an axion-like pseudoscalar degree of freedom, which naturally drives a period of cosmic inflation. Without committing to a specific microscopic mechanism for reheating, we demonstrate that the post-inflationary reheating dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the inflationary predictions. In particular, we show that assumptions about the reheating temperature and the equation-of-state parameter can significantly affect the predicted values of inflationary observables, highlighting the necessity of consistently incorporating reheating effects in the phenomenological analysis of inflationary models.",
Cross submissions,Running Love Numbers of Charged Black Holes,"Sergio Barbosa,Sylvain Fichet,Lucas de Souza",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Loops of virtual particles from the vacuum of quantum field theory (QFT) render black holes tidally deformable. We compute the static tidal response of unspinning charged black holes at arbitrary radius, using the perturbative formalism developed in2501.18684. Since the gravitational and electromagnetic tidal responses mix, we generalize the notion of Love numbers to Love matrices. We derive the coupled equations of motion for the metric and electromagnetic fluctuations around purely electric and magnetic backgrounds. For large charged black holes, which are described by the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity, we compute the full set of Love matrices induced by an arbitrary tower of $F^{2n}$ operators. We find that, although quantum corrections break electromagnetic duality, the Love matrices in electric and magnetic backgrounds are related by a $Z_2$ symmetry under electric-magnetic exchange. Going beyond EFT, we compute the Love matrices of small magnetic black holes. We show that the running of the Love matrices is governed by the running of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling, and we derive the correspondence between Love and $U(1)$ beta functions for arbitrary harmonics. The overall picture that emerges is that the QFT-induced tidal response of magnetic black holes saturates in the strong-field regime. These results imply that nearly-extremal magnetic black holes charged under an Abelian dark sector could be probed by gravitational-wave observations.",
Cross submissions,Realization of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 in Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity,"Yuxuan Kang,Mingzhe Li,Changzhi Yi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent observations from the DESI Collaboration indicate a preference for quintom dark energy, i.e., its equation of state evolves across the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we provide a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by introducing the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density in teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the intrinsic difficulties in the old models.",
