New submissions,Identification of Strongly Lensed Gravitational Wave Events Using Squeeze-and-Excitation Multilayer Perceptron Data-efficient Image Transformer,"Dejiang Li,Tonghua Liu,Ao Liu,Cuihong Wen,Jieci Wang,Kai Liao,Jiaxing Cui",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"With the advancement of third-generation gravitational wave detectors, the identification of strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) events is expected to play an increasingly vital role in cosmology and fundamental physics. However, traditional Bayesian inference methods suffer from combinatorial computational overhead as the number of events grows, making real-time analysis infeasible. To address this, we propose a deep learning model named Squeeze-and-Excitation Multilayer Perceptron Data-efficient Image Transformer (SEMD), based on Vision Transformers, which classifies strongly lensed GW events by modeling morphological similarity between time-frequency spectrogram pairs. By integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanisms and multilayer perceptrons , SEMD achieves strong feature extraction and discrimination. Trained and evaluated on simulated datasets using Advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope noise, the model demonstrates robustness and generalization across different detector sensitivities and physical conditions, highlighting the promise of deep learning for rapid identification of strongly lensed GW signals.",
New submissions,Implications for Pulsar Timing Arrays of Sub-solar Black Hole Detections: From LVK to Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer,"Yann Gouttenoire,Sokratis Trifinopoulos,Miguel Vanvlasselaer",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The detection of compact binary mergers with sub-solar masses at gravitational-wave observatories could mark the groundbreaking discovery of primordial black holes (PBHs). Concurrently, evidence for a nHz stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) could suggest a non-astrophysical origin, potentially arising from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). In this work, we analyze the connection between the two phenomena in the case where they share a common origin: the collapse of large primordial curvature perturbations in the early universe. We focus on sub-solar PBH populations within reach of upcoming experiments, including the current and future runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA as well as the third generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Using a Bayesian framework with physically motivated priors, we perform a consistent model comparison that incorporates existing astrophysical bounds together with the discovery potential of future detectors. Our analysis lends stronger support for the SIGW interpretation over the astrophysical one, as the narrowed priors place greater weight on the region of highest likelihood. Ultimately, we illustrate that combining PTA data with interferometer searches can deliver correlated evidence for new physics across multiple gravitational-wave bands.",
New submissions,GammaPBHPlotter: A public code for calculating the complete Hawking evaporation gamma-ray spectra from primordial black holes,"John Carlini,Ilias Cholis",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present GammaPBHPlotter, a public Python code for calculating and plotting the Hawking radiation gamma-ray spectra of primordial black holes in the mass range of $10^{14}$ to $10^{18}$ grams. This tool allows users to compute the monochromatic and mass-averaged spectra of black holes over a range of parameters. We include the primary/direct Hawking emission, the secondary emission from the decay and hadronization of unstable particles, the final state radiation, and the in-flight annihilation gamma-ray emission components.",
New submissions,Constraints on dark matter annihilation and turbulent reacceleration set by high-frequency observations of the radio halo in the Coma cluster,"P. Marchegiani,V. Vacca,F. Govoni,M. Murgia,F. Loi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study the impact of the recent observation of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster at 6.6 GHz with the Sardinia Radio Telescope on models based on turbulent reacceleration of electrons produced in dark matter annihilation processes. Observing at that frequency it is possible to obtain information on the electrons spectrum at energies where the effect of turbulent reacceleration becomes sub-dominant with respect to energy losses, and therefore to obtain information on the properties of seed electrons. Under the assumption that dark matter particles are neutralino-like particles annihilating at a rate close to the maximum allowed by Fermi-LAT upper limits in dwarf galaxies, we obtain some constraints on the intensity of the reacceleration and on the value of the neutralino mass. In particular, models with mass of the order of 10 GeV are generally disfavored, because they produce a high-frequency radio spectrum that can not reproduce the possible flattening observed between 5 and 6.6 GHz; on the other hand, models with mass of the order of 500 GeV, in order to reproduce the observed spectrum at frequencies below 100 MHz, require a reacceleration phase longer than $10^9$ yr, which would require more than one event responsible of the generation of turbulence in the cluster. The resulting optimal mass values are in the range 100--200 GeV, with a preference for the quark annihilation channel.",
New submissions,A Linearly Polarized Merger Shock Down to 550 MHz: A uGMRT Study of the Merging Cluster Abell 746,"Arpan Pal,Ruta Kale,Reinout J. van Weeren",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Radio relics, arc-like polarized sources with highly aligned magnetic fields, are typically found on the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. The magneto-ionic media responsible for the significant coherence observed in radio relics remain poorly understood. Low-frequency measurements of radio relics are essential for constraining depolarization models, which provide crucial insights into the magnetic field distribution. However, these measurements are challenging due to the emission properties and interferometer systematics. We have detected polarization signals from the northwest radio relic in Abell 746 at 650 MHz with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, marking the first-ever detection of polarisation from radio relics below 1 GHz. At this frequency, the average Rotation Measure (RM) corrected magnetic fields align well with shock radio emission, typical of radio relics. The fractional polarization at 650 MHz is $\sim 18\pm4 \%$. Our results indicate that a single internal depolarization model cannot explain the observed depolarization spectra, suggesting a non-uniform magnetic field distribution or complex contribution of different polarized regions in the radio relic. Our detection of polarization signals at 650 MHz reveals critical insights into radio relic magnetic field structures, offering a low-frequency approach to understanding ICM magnetic fields in merging galaxy clusters.",
New submissions,Gravitational Microlensing of the Galactic Centre $Î³$-Ray Excess: A New Test for Point-Like or Extended Emission?,"Nada Salama,Florian List,Geraint Lewis",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present a potential test of the origin of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass objects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between the possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from more prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an astrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small, currently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother emission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of gravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass lenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the size of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in the emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\gamma$-ray emission from dark matter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we find that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly greater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\gamma$-ray detectors. For a small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude increase in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events remaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would occur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a four-order-of-magnitude improvement. Whilst microlensing might not be a definitive test of the origin of the GCE, in future observations, it may prove useful in determining the properties of any point-like source population.",
New submissions,Constraining the Cosmological Constant from Stellar Orbits Around Sgr A* Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks,"Shinsei Eyama,Youhei Masada",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present a novel analytical framework employing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to constrain the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ through the analysis of stellar orbits around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A* at the Galactic center. Focusing on the well-observed S2 star, we use an inverse PINN (iPINN) architecture to infer orbital elements and estimate the total precession angle from astrometric data. By isolating the contribution from $\Lambda$, which is defined as the difference between the total precession and the Schwarzschild precession, we derive a stringent upper bound of $\Lambda \leq 5.67 \times 10^{-40}, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$, which is approximately two orders of magnitude tighter than previous estimates obtained using similar data-driven methods. Extension of our analysis to two additional long-period S-stars, S1 and S9, reveals that while the cosmological precession becomes relatively more prominent in such systems, limited orbital coverage introduces significant uncertainties in parameter estimation. Among the cases examined, the constraint derived from S2 remains the most robust. Our results highlight the potential of PINN-based approaches for extracting physical insights from sparse or noisy astronomical data. Future applications to next-generation observational data and further methodological improvements in machine learning are expected to refine the cosmological constraints and enable broader tests of gravitational theories.",
New submissions,Probe the missing baryons in cosmic filaments with Fast Radio Bursts,"Jian-Feng Mo,Weishan Zhu,Qi-Rui Yang,Yi Zheng,Long-Long Feng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Cosmic filaments are thought to host a substantial fraction of the missing baryons at redshifts $z<2$. In this study, we probe the baryonic content of these filaments using localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Filaments are identified from the galaxy distribution in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys using the DisPerSe algorithm. We find tentative evidence ($\sim 3 \sigma$ significance) for a divergence in the relationship between the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the intergalactic medium and redshift for FRBs whose signals intersect cosmic filaments compared to those that do not, suggesting excess baryons in the filamentary structures. Assuming an isothermal $\beta$-model gas profile with $\beta=2/3$, this discrepancy is best explained by a central baryon overdensity of $\delta = 20.78$, broadly consistent with previous simulation and observational results. The inferred baryon fraction residing in filaments decreases with redshift, from approximately $0.25-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.02$ to $0.15-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.5$, and $0.03-0.04\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.8$. These estimates are likely lower bounds, particularly at $z>0.5$, due to the limited number of identified filaments and localized FRBs at higher redshifts. We also examine various factors that may affect the statistical significance of our results. Our method offers an independent approach to tracing baryons in cosmic filaments and underscores the importance of expanding localized FRB samples and deepening galaxy surveys, which are key steps toward refining these estimates and addressing the missing baryon problem.",
New submissions,Constraining Ricci-Cubic Holographic Dark Energy from observational data using the MCMC sampling and enhanced Machine learning analysis,"Aritra Sanyal,Prabir Rudra",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we find constraints on the parameter space of the Ricci-Cubic Holographic dark energy (RCHDE) from various observational data sets like Hubble data, cosmic-chronometer data, Baryon-acoustic oscillation data, and also data from gamma-ray bursts. RCHDE is formed from the cubic invariant, which in turn is built from the cubic contractions of the Riemann and Ricci tensors. We have used the Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique to find constraints on the model parameters via Bayesian inference. Contour plots have been obtained for the model parameters, showing their marginalized and joint probability distributions. The best-fit regression lines are found for the constrained model and compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model to verify and validate the model. To complement this data analysis mechanism, we have also performed an enhanced machine learning analysis using observational Hubble parameter data. This approach serves to validate the model's predictive power through independent, data-driven regression techniques. Different graphical illustrations of the machine learning techniques have been presented to understand the results. These illustrations reveal a strong agreement between the Hubble parameter predictions from the machine learning models, the theoretical RCHDE model, and observational data.",
New submissions,"Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances to NGC 1316, NGC 1380, NGC 1404, & NGC 4457: A Pilot Study of a Parallel Distance Ladder Using Type Ia Supernovae in Early-Type Host Galaxies","Max J. B. Newman,Conor Larison,Saurabh W. Jha,Kristen B. W. McQuinn,Evan D. Skillman,Andrew E. Dolphin,Mi Dai,D. Andrew Howell,Curtis McCully,K. Azalee Bostroem,Daichi Hiramatsu,Craig Pellegrino,Estefania Padilla Gonzalez",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Though type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are found in all types of galaxies, recent local Hubble constant measurements have disfavored using SNe Ia in early-type or quiescent galaxies, aiming instead for better consistency with SNe Ia in star-forming, late-type host galaxies calibrated by Cepheid distances. Here we investigate the feasibility of a parallel distance ladder using SNe Ia exclusively in quiescent, massive ($\log M_*/M_{\odot} \geq 10$) host galaxies, calibrated by tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances. We present TRGB measurements to four galaxies: three measured from the Hubble Space Telescope with the ACS F814W filter, and one measured from the JWST NIRCam F090W filter. Combined with literature measurements, we define a TRGB calibrator sample of five high-mass, early-type galaxies that hosted well-measured SNe Ia: NGC 1316 (SN 2006dd), NGC 1380 (SN 1992A), NGC 1404 (SN 2007on, SN 2011iv), NGC 4457 (SN 2020nvb), and NGC 4636 (SN 2020ue). We jointly standardize these calibrators with a fiducial sample of 124 Hubble-flow SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility that are matched in host-galaxy and light-curve properties. Our results with this homogenized subsample show a Hubble residual scatter of under 0.11 mag, lower than usually observed in cosmological samples of the full SN~Ia distribution. We obtain a measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 75.3 \pm 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, including statistical and estimated systematic uncertainties, and discuss the potential to further improve the precision of this approach. As calibrator and supernova samples grow, we advocate that future cosmological applications of SNe Ia use subsamples matched in host-galaxy and supernova properties across redshift.",
New submissions,Strong Lens Discoveries in DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR10 with Two Deep Learning Architectures,"Jose Carlos Inchausti,Christopher J. Storfer,Xiaosheng Huang,Yuan-Ming Hsu,Brandt Kaufmann,Chaitanya Pasupala,S. Banka,A. Dey,D. Lang,A. Meisner,J. Moustakas,A.D. Myers,E. F. Schlafly,D.J. Schlegel",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We have conducted a search for strong gravitational lensing systems in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10 (DR10). This paper is the fourth in a series of searches (following Huang et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2021; Storfer et al. 2024, Paper I, II, & III respectively). This is the first catalog of lens candidates covering nearly the entirety of the extragalactic sky south of declination $\delta\approx +32$ deg, all of it observed by the DECam, covering $\sim$14,000 $deg^2$. We impose a $z$-band magnitude cut of < 20 in AB magnitude. We deploy a Residual Neural Network and EfficientNet as an ensemble trained on a compilation of known lensing systems and high-grade candidates as well as nonlenses in the same footprint. The predictions from these two base models are aggregated using a meta-learner. After applying our ensemble to the survey data, we exclude known candidates and systems, and use our own visual inspection portal to rank images in the top 0.01 percentile of all neural network recommendations. We have found 811 new lens candidates. These include 484 new candidates in the Legacy Surveys DR9 footprint, all parts of which have been searched for strong lenses at least once before, either by our group or others. Combining the discoveries from this work with those from Paper I (335), II (1210), and III (1512), we have discovered a total of 3868 new candidates in the DESI Legacy Surveys.",
New submissions,Probing Evolution of Long Gamma-Ray Burst Properties through Their Cosmic Formation History,"Nikita S. Khatiya,Maria Giovanna Dainotti,Aditya Narendra,Dhruv S. Bal,Aleksander Å. Lenart,Dieter H. Hartmann",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The astrophysics of Long GRB (LGRB) progenitors as well as possible cosmological evolution in their properties still poses many open questions. Previous studies suggest that the LGRB rate density (LGRB-RD) follows the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) only at high-z and attribute this to the metallicity evolution of progenitor stars. For low z, opinions differ on whether the uptick in the LGRB RD is due to a distinct class of low-luminosity GRBs or perhaps even a different progenitor subclass. To investigate these questions, we utilize data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based observatories (redshift). To test the hypothesis that the observations can be mapped (with/without evolution) to the well-established cosmic SFRD, we consider three cases: no evolution, beaming angle evolution, and a simple power-law evolution. The comparison shows that the 'no evolution' case can be ruled out. Our study highlights that the beaming angle evolution or the simple power law evolution are also not sufficient to obtain a good match between the LGRB-RD and SFRD. Rather, the inclusion of multiple evolving properties of LGRBs in combination appears to be required to match the two rate densities in their entirety.",
Cross submissions,Observational bounds on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars from Gravitational Wave Data,"Rafael M. Santos,Rafael C. Nunes,Jaziel G. Coelho,Jose C. N. de Araujo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Recent gravitational-wave (GW) observations offer a unique opportunity to probe the fundamental nature of compact objects. A growing body of research has focused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of DM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly alter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal deformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during binary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that, for the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using real GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115, and GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\chi}$, and particle mass, $m_{\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a scalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on $F_{\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating that different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in different ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM halo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105 and GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding strong upper bounds on $F_{\chi}$. The corresponding values for the mass scale $m_{\chi}$ are also discussed in the text. This work offers a new approach to probing DM in the context of compact NS objects through GW observations.",
Cross submissions,Scalar-induced gravitational waves in spatially covariant gravity,"Jiehao Jiang,Jieming Lin,Xian Gao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the framework of spatially covariant gravity (SCG), a broad class of Lorentz-violating modified gravity theories respecting only spatial diffeomorphism invariance. Extending earlier SCG formulations, we compute the general kernel function for SIGWs on a flat Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker background, focusing on polynomial-type SCG Lagrangians up to $d=3$, where $d$ denotes the total number of derivatives in each monomial. We derive explicit expressions for the kernel in the case of power-law time evolution of the coefficients, and restrict attention to the subset of SCG operators whose tensor modes propagate at the speed of light, thereby avoiding late-time divergences in the fractional energy density of SIGWs. Instead of the usual Newtonian gauge, the breaking of time reparametrization symmetry in SCG necessitates a unitary gauge analysis. We compute the energy density of SIGWs for representative parameter combinations, finding distinctive deviations from general relativity (GR), including scale-dependent modifications to both the amplitude and the spectral shape. Our results highlight the potential of stochastic GW background measurements to probe spatially covariant gravity and other Lorentz-violating extensions of GR.",
