New submissions,Identifying Anomalous DESI Galaxy Spectra with a Variational Autoencoder,"C. Nicolaou,R.P. Nathan,O. Lahav,A. Palmese,A. Saintonge,J. Aguilar,S. Ahlen,C. Allende Prieto,S. Bailey,S.

Sprayberry,G. Tarlé,B. A. Weaver,H. Zou",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The tens of millions of spectra being captured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provide tremendous discovery potential. In this work we show how Machine Learning, in particular Variational Autoencoders (VAE), can detect anomalies in a sample of approximately 200,000 DESI spectra comprising galaxies, quasars and stars. We demonstrate that the VAE can compress the dimensionality of a spectrum by a factor of 100, while still retaining enough information to accurately reconstruct spectral features. We then detect anomalous spectra as those with high reconstruction error and those which are isolated in the VAE latent representation. The anomalies identified fall into two categories: spectra with artefacts and spectra with unique physical features. Awareness of the former can help to improve the DESI spectroscopic pipeline; whilst the latter can lead to the identification of new and unusual objects. To further curate the list of outliers, we use the Astronomaly package which employs Active Learning to provide personalised outlier recommendations for visual inspection. In this work we also explore the VAE latent space, finding that different object classes and subclasses are separated despite being unlabelled. We demonstrate the interpretability of this latent space by identifying tracks within it that correspond to various spectral characteristics. For example, we find tracks that correspond to increasing star formation and increase in broad emission lines along the Balmer series. In upcoming work we hope to apply the methods presented here to search for both systematics and astrophysically interesting objects in much larger datasets of DESI spectra.",
New submissions,Mapping the gas density with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and patchy screening effects: a self-consistent comparison,"Boryana Hadzhiyska,Noah Sailer,Simone Ferraro",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The secondary anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a wealth of astrophysical and cosmological information. Pairing measurements of the CMB temperature map obtained by DR5 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with the large-scale structure imaging survey conducted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, DECaLS DR9, we investigate two effects that are sensitive to the gas density $\tau$: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) and `patchy screening' (also known as `anisotropic screening'). In particular, we measure the stacked profiles around Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) at a mean redshift of $z \approx 0.7$. We detect the kSZ signal at 7.2$\sigma$, and we find a signal at $\sim 4.1\sigma$ for the patchy screening estimator, which is in excess relative to the kSZ signal. We attribute this excess to contamination from CMB lensing. We demonstrate the effect of lensing using $N$-body simulations, and we show that the screening signal is dominated by it. Accounting for lensing, our measurement places a 95\% upper bound on the optical depth of the Extended DESI LRG sample of $\tau <$ 2.5 $10^{-4}$ for a mean value of the sample of $\tau \approx$ 1.6 $10^{-4}$. Furthermore, via hydro simulations, we show that the underlying optical depth signal measured by both effects (after removing the CMB lensing contribution) is in perfect agreement when adopting either a Compensated Aperture Photometry (CAP) filter or a high-pass filter. Consistent with previous measurements, we see evidence for excess baryonic feedback around DESI LRGs in the patchy screening measurement. Provided both effects are measured with high signal-to-noise, one can measure the amplitude ratio between them, which is proportional to the root-mean-square velocity of the host halo sample, and place constraints on velocity-sensitive models such as modified gravity and phantom dark energy.",
New submissions,Time-frequency Imprints of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Confusion Gravitational Wave Background,"Lingyuan Ji,Liang Dai",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Detecting individual extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) is a major science goal of future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and TianQin. However, matched-filtering can be challenging as waveform templates are required to be accurate over tens of thousands of orbits. We introduce the time-frequency spectrum as an alternative observable that can be exploited to reveal the chirping of EMRIs at the population level. We analytically calculate this spectrum and its correlators for parameterized populations of slowly chirping sources on quasi-circular orbits, assuming a simplified model of the antenna response for a proof of concept. We then exploit this observable to distinguish between Galactic white dwarf binaries and a possible EMRI population, and quantify the precision at which EMRI population parameters can be determined through a Fisher analysis. We explore several scenarios of EMRI populations and find that this new method may allow us to determine EMRI population parameters at an accuracy level of several percent. Since white dwarf binaries have much longer chirping timescales than the EMRIs do, EMRI population properties can still be determined even if their stochastic gravitational wave background has a power spectrum two orders of magnitude weaker than that of the Galactic white dwarf binaries.",
New submissions,Consistent Initial Conditions for Early Modified Gravity in Effective Field Theory,"Jiaming Pan,Meng-Xiang Lin,Gen Ye,Marco Raveri,Alessandra Silvestri",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Precise initial conditions (ICs) are crucial for accurate computation in cosmological perturbation theory. We derive the consistent ICs for Horndeski theory in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach, assuming constant EFT functions at early times. We implement the ICs into the public Boltzmann code \texttt{EFTCAMB}, and demonstrate that the expected early-time behavior of perturbations and Weyl potential can be obtained with theory-consistent MG ICs. We identify significant deviations when comparing Cosmic Microwave Background angular power spectra in MG models obtained with consistent MG ICs versus inconsistent GR ICs. Our findings underline the importance of using accurate, theory-consistent MG ICs to ensure robust cosmological constraints on early MG models.",
New submissions,"Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$β$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation","Shulei Cao,Amit Kumar Mandal,Michal Zajaček,Bharat Ratra",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,Å\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.",
New submissions,Association between optically identified galaxy clusters and the underlying dark matter halos,DES Collaboration,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Clusters of galaxies trace massive dark matter halos in the Universe, but they can include multiple halos projected along lines of sight. We study the halos contributing to clusters using the Cardinal simulation, which mimics the Dark Energy Survey data. We use the red-sequence-based cluster finding algorithm redMaPPer as a case study. For each cluster, we identify the halos hosting its member galaxies, and we define the main halo as the one contributing the most to the cluster's richness ($\lambda$, the estimated number of member galaxies). At $z=0.3$, for clusters with $\lambda > 60$, the main halo typically contributes to $92\%$ of the richness, and this fraction drops to $67\%$ for $\lambda \approx 20$. Defining ""clean"" clusters as those with $\geq50\%$ of the richness contributed by the main halo, we find that $100\%$ of the $\lambda > 60$ clusters are clean, while $73\%$ of the $\lambda \approx 20$ clusters are clean. Three halos can usually account for more than $80\%$ of the richness of a cluster. The main halos associated with redMaPPer clusters have a completeness ranging from $98\%$ at virial mass $10^{14.6}~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ to $64\%$ at $10^{14}~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. In addition, we compare the inferred cluster centers with true halo centers, finding that $30\%$ of the clusters are miscentered with a mean offset $40\%$ of the cluster radii, in agreement with recent X-ray studies. These systematics worsen as redshift increases, but we expect that upcoming surveys extending to longer wavelengths will improve the cluster finding at high redshifts. Our results affirm the robustness of the redMaPPer algorithm and provide a framework for benchmarking other cluster-finding strategies.",
New submissions,Transient star B/R ratio and star formation in $z\gtrsim 1$ lensed galaxies,"Sung Kei Li,Jose M. Palencia,Jose M. Diego,Jeremy Lim,Patrick L. Kelly,Ashish K. Meena,James Nianias,Hayley Williams,Liliya L.R. Williams,Adi Zitrin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The extreme magnification from galaxy clusters and microlenses therein allows the detection of individual, luminous stars in lensed galaxies as transient events, and hence provides a valuable window into the high mass stellar population in $z>1$ galaxies. As these bright stars can only be formed at specific ages, the relative abundance of transient events at blue (B) and red (R) optical wavelengths ($B/R$ ratio) can provide insights into the star formation history of lensed galaxies. Here, we forward model the transient detection rates in an idealized mock scenario to find that the $B/R$ ratio of strongly lensed $z>1$ galaxies decreases quickly with increasing age. This ratio has comparatively low sensitivity to metallicity and dust attenuation, with no significant dependency on the stellar initial mass function. As a proof-of-concept, we show that a simple starburst cannot simultaneously fit the $B/R$ and spectral energy distribution of the ``Warhol'' arc ($z = 0.94$), indicating a more complex (recent) star formation history. Although limited only to lensed higher redshift galaxies in cluster fields, this result shows that the transient $B/R$ ratio could be used as an additional, complementary constraint on the star formation history of higher redshift galaxies in future works.",
New submissions,Outflowing shocked gas dominates the NIR H$_2$ emission from the dual AGN NGC6240,"J. Carlsen,C. Cicone,B. Hagedorn,K. Rubinur,P. Andreani,K. Dasyra,P. Severgnini,C. Vignali,R. Morganti,T. Oosterloo,A. Lasrado,E. Lopez-Rodriguez,S. Shen",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"[Abridged] We present a multi-line study of the kinematics of the molecular and ionised gas phases in the central 2 kpc of NGC6240, based on JWST/NIRSpec and ALMA observations. We devised a new spectral-line fitting approach to de-blend rotating and non-rotating gas components, which is better tailored to the extreme feedback mechanisms at work in NGC6240. We find that ~65% of the Pa$\alpha$, H$_2$, and [FeII] line fluxes within the NIRSpec field of view arise from gas components that are kinematically decoupled from the stars. The NIR H$_2$ lines show the most deviation from the stars, with peak emission between the two rotating stellar structures. The PAH 3.3$\mu$m feature does not follow the NIR H$_2$ morphology, indicating that the latter does not trace PDRs. In the non-rotating gas components, we identify a biconical wind launched from the northern AGN, expanding along the minor axis of stellar rotation. This wind is dominated by ionised gas and, although it entrains some H$_2$, it does not show a H$_2$/PAH enhancement, suggesting either high UV irradiation or expansion along a relatively gas-free path. Furthermore, we find bright non-rotating gas emission between the two AGN and around the southern AGN, which we interpret as due to an outflow launched from the southern nucleus, coinciding with the molecular outflow previously studied in cold (sub-)millimeter tracers. The strong H$_2$/PAH enhancement measured in this region, coextensive with high velocity redshifted gas ($v\sim900$ km s$^{-1}$), suggests that the shocks responsible for the high H$_2$/PAH ratios are due to the outflow rather than to the collision of media during the merger. Our results show that the bulk of the NIR line emission in NGC6240 is decoupled from the stars, and that most of the warm H$_2$ is shock-excited and embedded in a powerful outflow, where it coexists with colder molecular gas.",
New submissions,Dark Bondi Accretion Aided by Baryons and the Origin of JWST Little Red Dots,"Wei-Xiang Feng,Hai-Bo Yu,Yi-Ming Zhong",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter halos provides a compelling mechanism for seeding supermassive black holes in the early Universe. In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately $1\%$ of its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts $z\sim4-11$, where black holes with masses of $10^7{\rm\,M_\odot}$ can form within $500{\rm\,Myr}$ after the formation of host halos with masses of $10^{9}{\rm\,M_\odot}$. Even if the initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas. Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.",
New submissions,Cosmic Distance Duality Relation with DESI DR2 and Transparency,"Xuwei Zhang,Xiaofeng Yang,Yunliang Ren,Shuangnan Chen,Yangjun Shi,Cheng Cheng,Xiaolong He",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR), a fundamental assumption in modern cosmology, posits a direct link between angular diameter distance and luminosity distance. This study presents a comprehensive, model-independent, and data-driven test of the CDDR using a combination of cosmological observations, including Supernovae (SN), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Hubble parameter ($H(z)$) measurements. We employ both Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and a novel Compressed Point (CPI) method for reconstructing the CDDR, alongside four distinct parameterizations for potential deviations. Nuisance parameters, such as the supernova absolute magnitude and BAO scale, are rigorously handled via both joint numerical fitting (Method I) and analytic marginalization (Method II). Our findings reveal that while direct reconstruction of the CDDR exhibits no significant deviation (less than 1-$\sigma$) under specific prior assumptions, a notable departure emerges when the SH0ES prior is incorporated, suggesting a systematic influence from the Hubble constant tension. Independently, our parameterized analysis corroborates the consistency of CDDR and confirms the equivalence of the two constraint methodologies. We also find no significant evidence for cosmic opacity. A comparative assessment of reconstruction techniques indicates that GPR generally yields higher precision. These results emphasize the critical role of prior choices and statistical methods in CDDR analyses, providing valuable insights into fundamental cosmological principles and the ongoing Hubble tension.",
New submissions,"Holographic dark energy models in $f(Q,T)$ gravity and cosmic constraint","Xuwei Zhang,Xiaofeng Yang,Yunliang Ren,Shuangnan Chen,Yangjun Shi,Cheng Cheng,Xiaolong He",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we propose a new model that combines holographic dark energy with modified gravity $f(Q,T)$ to explore a possible explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. We incorporate the holographic principle into non-metric gravity with non-minimal matter coupling and introduce the Barrow holographic dark energy model to account for a tighter corrections, allowing for a more generalized discussion. Furthermore, we perform parameter estimation using the latest observational data, including Type Ia supernova, BAO and Hubble parameter direct measurements. Our results show that the model provides a theoretical framework to describe late-time cosmic evolution and the universe's accelerated expansion. Despite the additional complexity introduced, the model offers a viable approach for investigating dark energy within modified gravity theories.",
New submissions,Radiatively Corrected Starobinsky Inflation and Primordial Gravitational Waves in Light of ACT Observations,"Waqas Ahmed,Mansoor Ur Rehman",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Nonminimal coupling between the inflaton and the Ricci scalar plays a crucial role in shaping the predictions of single-field inflationary models. While a quartic potential with such coupling represents one of the simplest realizations compatible with cosmological observations, it generically receives important radiative corrections when the inflaton interacts with other fields, particularly those involved in the reheating process. In this work, we focus on radiative corrections arising from bosonic scalar couplings and study their impact on inflationary dynamics within the nonminimally coupled quartic potential framework. We demonstrate that bosonic corrections, unlike fermionic ones, yield predictions more compatible with the latest constraints from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6, especially when combined with Planck and BICEP/Keck data. We begin with a general model involving a gauge-singlet real scalar inflaton coupled to a complex scalar field, which could be the Standard Model Higgs or a GUT Higgs. As a concrete realization, we also investigate the case where the inflaton serves as a dark matter candidate through a Higgs portal interaction while highlighting its potential to generate observable levels of primordial gravitational waves. Notably, the nonminimally coupled inflation model studied here is field-theoretically equivalent to the Starobinsky model, and the inclusion of quantum corrections from scalar fields leads to characteristic imprints in the $(n_s, r)$ plane, allowing for refined constraints on scalar couplings from current and future observations.",
New submissions,Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background,"Shreyas Tiruvaskar,Chris Gordon",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ``final-parsec problem.'' Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15 year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.",
New submissions,Unveiling the Pitfalls of CPL Parametrization at High Redshifts: A Critical Assessment of the $ω_{0}$$ω_a$CDM Model with DESI DR2 BAO Data,Seokcheon Lee,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We critically assess the w0waCDM model, employing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, w(z) = w0 + wa * z / (1 + z), using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Release 2 (DR2). While DESI BAO data broadly align with the standard LambdaCDM model, giving Omega_m = 0.3, our Markov Chain Monte Carlo fits show notable variation in best-fit values and degeneracy directions for w0waCDM across combinations of BAO observables (DV/rd, DM/rd, DH/rd, and DM/DH).When constrained solely by DESI BAO data, the w0waCDM model shows internal inconsistencies. Unlike LambdaCDM and wCDM, which fit all observables consistently, w0waCDM predicts lower values for rd-dependent observables and higher values for DM/DH. This conflict, including unphysical parameter compensation at high redshift, reflects limitations of the CPL form, especially its behavior at high redshift. The model compensates for poor individual fits by inflating Omega_m and driving wa to large negative values.Our findings suggest that DESI DR2 BAO data alone do not robustly constrain w0waCDM due to degeneracies and CPL limitations. These issues affect both rd-based and ratio observables like DM/DH. We recommend applying dynamical dark energy parametrizations directly to DV, DM, and DH measurements to better constrain wa across redshifts.",

Ritacco,H. Roussel,F. Ruppin,M. Sanchez-Portal,S. Savorgnano,K. Schuster,A. Sievers,C. Tucker,R. Zylka",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"(Abridged) Clusters of galaxies, formed in the latest stages of structure formation, are unique cosmological probes. With the advent of large CMB surveys like those from the Planck satellite, the ACT and SPT telescopes, we now have access to a large number of galaxy clusters detected at millimeter wavelengths via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Nevertheless, it is interesting to complement them with high-angular-resolution (tens of arcseconds) observations to target the lowest-mass and highest-redshift clusters. This is the case of observations with the NIKA2 camera, which is installed on the IRAM 30--m telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain. We used the existing 150 GHz (2 mm) data from the NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS) Large Program to blindly search for galaxy clusters in the well-known COSMOS field, across a 877 arcmin$^2$ region centered on (R.A., Dec.)$_{J2000}$ = (10h00m28.81s, +02d17m30.44s). We first developed a dedicated data reduction pipeline to construct NIKA2 maps at 2 mm. We then used a matched-filter algorithm to extract cluster candidates assuming a universal pressure profile to model the expected cluster tSZ signal. We computed the purity and completeness of the sample by applying the previous algorithm to simulated maps of the sky signal in the COSMOS field. We find a total of 16 cluster candidates at S/N > 4, from which eight have either an optical or X-ray cluster (or group of galaxies) counterpart. This is the first blind detection of clusters of galaxies at mm wavelengths at 18"" angular resolution. From this analysis, we confirm that NIKA2 and the IRAM 30--m telescope should be sensitive to low-mass clusters at intermediate and high redshift, complementing current and planned large tSZ-based cluster surveys.",
New submissions,Comparison of $R_h=ct$ and $Λ$CDM using DESI DR1 measurements,"Kunj Panchal,Shantanu Desai",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We use DESI DR1 BAO measurements of the ratio of tranvserse comoving distance to Hubble distance in order to test the compatibility of $R_h=ct$ over flat $\Lambda$CDM. For this purpose, we used Bayesian model selection to evaluate the efficacy of these models given the observed data. When we consider the BAO measurements up to redshift of 1.3, both models are equally favored. However, when we consider the Lyman-$\alpha$ QSO measurement at redshift of 2.33, we find Bayes factors of greater than 100 for flat $\Lambda$CDM over $R_h=ct$ using two different priors for $\Omega_m$, indicating that $\Lambda$CDM is decisively favored over $R_h=ct$. The same is the case when we combine all the measurements. Therefore, the DESI DRI measurements rule out $R_h=ct$ cosmology, albeit this is driven by the Lyman-$\alpha$ QSO measurement at $z=2.33$.",
New submissions,X-ray emission in IllustrisTNG circum-cluster environments. II -- Possible origins of the soft X-ray excess emission,"Celine Gouin,Massimiliano Bonamente,Stephen Walker,Mohammad Mirakhor,Richard Lieu,Clotilde Laigle,Etienne Bonnassieux,Charlotte Welker,Stefano Gallo,Tony Bonnaire,Jade Paste",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"An excess of soft X-ray emission (0.2-1 keV) above the contribution from the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) has been detected in a number of galaxy clusters, including the Coma cluster. The physical origin of this emitting medium above hot ICM has not yet been determined, especially whether it be thermal or non-thermal. We aim to investigate which gas phase and gas structure more accurately reproduce the soft excess radiation from the cluster core to the outskirts, using simulations. By using the simulation TNG300, we predict the radial profile of thermodynamic properties and the Soft-X-ray surface brightness of 138 clusters within 5 $R_{200}$. Their X-ray emission is simulated for the hot ICM gas phase, the entire Warm-Hot medium, the diffuse and low-density Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). Inside clusters, the soft excess appears to be produced by substructures of the WARM gas phase which host dense warm clumps (i.e, the Warm Circum-Galactic Medium, WCGM), and in fact the inner soft excess is strongly correlated with substructure and WCGM mass fractions. Outside of the virial radius, the fraction of WHIM gas that is mostly inside filaments connected to clusters boosts the soft X-ray excess. The more diffuse the gas is, the higher the soft X-ray excess beyond the virial region. The thermal emission of WARM gas phase, in the form of WCGM clumps and WHIM diffuse filaments, reproduces well the soft excess emission that was observed up to the virial radius in Coma and in the inner regions of other massive clusters. Moreover, our analysis suggests that soft X-ray excess is a proxy of cluster dynamical state, with larger excess being observed in the most unrelaxed clusters.",
New submissions,Cosmic Sign-Reversal: Non-Parametric Reconstruction of Interacting Dark Energy with DESI DR2,"Yun-He Li,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.",
New submissions,Flash Ionization of the Early Universe by Pop III.1 Supermassive Stars,Jonathan C. Tan(Chalmers Univ. and Univ. of Virginia),Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The Pop III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts that a substantial fraction of the early universe was ionized by supermassive stars at redshifts $z\sim20-30$, an era we refer to as ``The Flash''. This is followed by recombination to a mainly neutral state within a few tens of Myr. Here we discuss the implication of this ionization for the scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), $\tau$. We find a fiducial contribution of $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.04$. Combining this with the contribution to reionization by standard galaxy populations at $z\lesssim 10$ with $\tau_{\rm gal}\simeq0.06$, yields a total of $\tau\simeq0.10$. As noted recently by several authors, such a value can help resolve apparent ``problems'' faced by $\Lambda$CDM of negative neutrino masses and dynamical dark energy that have been implied by recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).",
New submissions,FuGa3D: Fast full-sky analysis of Galaxy catalogs in 3D,"Elina Keihänen,Jani Haapala,Valtteri Lindholm,Martin Reinecke,Susan Rissanen,Jussi Valiviita,Akke Viitanen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present FuGa3D, a code for fast computation of correlation functions and power spectra for galaxy survey observables, including galaxy clustering and cosmic shear. We define the redshift-space correlation function (RCF) as the correlation function defined in the parameter space of two redshifts and an angular separation angle. Assuming that there is no preferred direction in the sky, these parameters fully define the relative position of two galaxies, independently of the assumed cosmological model. Once the RCF is constructed, it is easy to compute derived correlation metrics, such as the real-space clustering correlation function and its multipoles. We further define the redshift-space power spectrum as the harmonic counterpart of the RCF, and show that it can be computed efficiently using the discrete galaxy coordinates. We validate the code with simulated mock catalogs. Computing the RCF and the two-point correlation function at 1.5 Mpc (3 Mpc) resolution for a MICE simulation with 46 million galaxies, took 47 node-min for clustering only, and 7.3 node-hours with shear analysis included.",
New submissions,Comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for feature selection and classification of Fast Radio Bursts,"Ailton J. B. Júnior,Jéferson A. S. Fortunato,Leonardo J. Silvestre,Thonimar V. Alencar,Wiliam S. Hipólito-Ricaldi",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, exhibiting a wide range of physical and observational properties. Distinguishing between repeating and non-repeating FRBs remains a key challenge in understanding their nature. In this work, we apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs based on both primary observables from the CHIME catalog and physically motivated derived features. We evaluate three hybrid pipelines combining dimensionality reduction with clustering: PCA + k-means, t-SNE + HDBSCAN, and t-SNE + Spectral Clustering. To identify optimal hyperparameters, we implement a comprehensive grid search using a custom scoring function that prioritizes recall while penalizing excessive cluster fragmentation and noise. Feature relevance is assessed using principal component loadings, mutual information with the known repeater label, and permutation-based F\textsubscript{2} score sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the derived features including redshift, luminosity, and spectral properties, such as the spectral index and the spectral running, significantly enhance the classification performance. Finally, we identify a set of FRBs currently labeled as non-repeaters that consistently cluster with known repeaters across all methods, highlighting promising candidates for future follow-up observations and reinforcing the utility of unsupervised approaches in FRB population studies.",
New submissions,A field-level reaction for screened modified gravity,"Daniela Saadeh,Kazuya Koyama,Xan Morice-Atkinson",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a field-level reaction framework to emulate the nonlinear effects of screened modified gravity on the cosmic web. This approach is designed to enable field-level inference with data from Stage IV cosmological surveys. Building on the reaction method, which models the nonlinear matter power spectrum in modified gravity as corrections to a ""pseudo"" $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we extend the method to full field-level predictions by applying it to the output of $N$-body simulations, including both positions and velocities. We focus on modifications to gravity that are scale-independent at the linear level, allowing us to isolate and emulate nonlinear deviations, particularly screening effects. Our neural network predicts the field-level correction (""reaction"") to a pseudo$\Lambda$CDM simulation whose linear clustering matches that of the target. The emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy across a broad range of summary statistics, including 0.4\% agreement in the matter power spectrum at scales $k < 1$ Mpc$/h$, and 2\% accuracy in redshift-space distortion multipoles at $k < 0.3$ Mpc$/h$. We also validate the emulator against $N$-body simulations with increased force resolution and time steps, confirming the robustness of its performance. These results demonstrate that our framework is a practical and reliable tool for incorporating screened modified gravity models into field-level cosmological inference, enabling stringent tests of extra fundamental forces at cosmological scales.",
Cross submissions,Phase transitions in a holographic superfluid model with non-linear terms beyond the probe limit,"Zi-Qiang Zhao,Zhang-Yu Nie,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the holographic s-wave superfluid model with 4th and 6th power self-interaction terms $\lambda |\psi|^4$ and $\tau |\psi|^6$ with considering the full back-reaction of the matter fields on the metric in the 3+1 dimensional bulk. The self-interaction terms are good at controlling the condensate to realize various phase transitions, such as the zeroth-order, first-order, and second-order phase transitions within the single condensate s-wave superfluid model. Therefore, in this work, we are able to investigate the influence of the back-reaction strength on the various phase transitions, including the zeroth and first order phase transitions. In addition, we confirm that the influence of the 4th and 6th power terms on the superfluid phase transition in the case of finite back-reaction are qualitative the same as in the probe limit, thus present universality. We also plot the special value $\lambda_s$ of the parameter $\lambda$ at different back-reaction strength, below which the condensate grows to an opposite direction and is important in controlling the order of the superfluid phase transitions. Comparing the influence of the back-reaction parameter and that of the higher-order nonlinear coefficients, we see that the back-reaction strength brings in both the effective couplings similar to the 4th power and 6th power terms.",
Cross submissions,Primordial Gravitational Waves as Complementary Probe of Dark Matter Indirect Detection,"Anish Ghoshal,Debarun Paul,Supratik Pal",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a novel cosmological probe of dark matter (DM) through inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) measurements highlighting its complementarity with traditional indirect detection. In scenarios like early matter domination (EMD), the thermal DM relic is diluted and then replenished via non-thermal production, leaving characteristic imprints on the primordial GW spectrum, inducing frequency-dependent suppressions in the GW amplitudes. By analysing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and employing Fisher forecast, we show that upcoming GW experiments have good potential to probe the DM parameter space involving its mass and annihilation cross-section. We show, for instance, LISA will be sensitive to DM mass range $[2\times 10^2-10^5]$ GeV. Furthermore, we identify a significant overlap of the GW missions' sensitivity reaches with the projected reach of future indirect searches like CTA with gamma rays, ANTARES, KM3NeT with neutrinos. In those overlapping regions of interests, we forecast on the GW experiments to estimate the precision of measurements. We show, for instance, that DM mass of $10^5$ GeV with an annihilation cross-section of $10^{-24}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$, and a mass of $10^4$ GeV with an annihilation cross-section of $2\times10^{-25}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$, lie within the projections of CTA. We find that whilst the former can be probed by ET with $\sim 1\%$ uncertainties, the latter can be probed by $\mu$-ARES with $\sim 7 \%$ uncertainties. Similarly, DM mass of $10^5$ GeV, with cross-section $10^{-23}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$ lies within the projection of ANTARES and KM3NeT, which can be probed by ET with $\sim 1\%$ uncertainties.",
Cross submissions,Numerical simulation of the false vacuum decay at finite temperature,"Haiyang Wang,Renhui Qin,Ligong Bian",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"The false vacuum decay rate is of important meaning in understanding the Universe, such as the symmetry breaking process in the early universe and the age of our universe, which is conventionally calculated with the saddle-point approximation in the field theory. Utilizing the extension of the Wigner function in quantum field theory, we numerically calculate the decay rate of the false vacuum through path integral. We study the decay rate for the thermal fluctuation scenarios and its dependence on the potential shape, and found that the false vacuum decay occurs following an exponentially decay rate, and the speed of vacuum decay decreases when the initial energy of the system decreases and the potential height increase. The discrepancy between the simulation results and the theoretical prediction of finite temperature effective field theory is observed.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational-Wave Background from Extragalactic Double White Dwarfs for LISA,"Guillaume Boileau,Tristan Bruel Alexandre Toubiana,Astrid Lamberts,Nelson Christensen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent studies have revealed the contribution of extragalactic DWD to the astrophysical SGWB could be detectable in the mHz regime by LISA. Conversely, the presence of this SGWB could hamper the detection of cosmological SGWB, which are one of the key targets of GW astronomy. We aim to confirm the spectrum of the extragalactic DWD SGWB and estimate its detectability with LISA under different assumptions. We also aim at understanding the main uncertainties in the spectrum and estimate if the signal could be anisotropic. We use population synthesis code COSMIC with several assumptions on binary evolution and initial conditions. We incorporate a specific treatment to account for the mass transfer and tidal torques after DWDs formation. Our study is in global agreement with previous studies, although we find a lower contribution at high frequencies, due to a different treatment of mass transfer in stellar binaries. We find that the uncertainties in the amplitude are dominated by the SFR model, and to a lesser degree by the binary evolution model. The inclusion of tidal effects and mass transfer episodes in DWDs can change the amplitude of the estimated SGWB up to a factor 3 at the highest frequencies. For all the models, we find that this SGWB could be potentially observable by LISA after 4 years. Under the hypothesis of an homogeneous Universe beyond 200Mpc, anisotropies associated to the astrophysical population of DWDs will likely not be detectable. We provide fits of this SGWB under different assumptions to be used by the community. We demonstrate variability in SGWB predictions, emphasizing uncertainties due to different astrophysical assumptions. We highlight the importance of determining the position of the knee in the SGWB spectrum, as it provides insights on mass transfer models. The prediction of this SGWB is of critical importance for LISA in the context of observing other SGWB.",

In this paper, we consider inflationary models including the power law potential, the hilltop model, the polynomial $\alpha$-attractor and exponential $\alpha-$attractor, with non-minimally derivative coupling in the high friction limit, and show how the models can fit ACT data. We also derive constraints on the model parameters using the latest ACT data.",

Axions and axion-like particles are among the leading dark-matter candidates, and numerous attempts to detect them in laboratories have been performed. Here, we propose to advance these efforts substantially, extending the sensitivity for dark-matter axions in the mass range $(38-54)~\mu$eV down to the axion-photon couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\lesssim \left(10^{-14}-10^{-15}\right)$ GeV$^{-1}$, motivated by generic models of Quantum Chromodynamics axion. Single-photon detectors operating at ultra-low temperatures are key elements of the experiment. The projected sensitivity will be reached in one year of data taking with magnetic field of $(1-10)$ T, making Cosmological Axion Sarov Haloscope (CASH) the most sensitive haloscope in this mass range.",
Cross submissions,The gravitational wave echoes from the black hole with three-form fields,"Natthason Autthisin,Supakchai Ponglertsakul,Daris Samart",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we study of massless three-form black hole, where the three-form fields are higher $p$-form gauge fields with $p=3$. These give rise to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (Sch-dS)-like solution through an effective cosmological constant represented by $a_1$. We analyze this solution under gravitational perturbations and find that it exhibits a single-peak potential. For this case, no echoes are produced. Furthermore, we consider the massive case of the three-form fields by introducing a Stueckelberg field to restore gauge invariance and to investigate its effect on GWs at late times. In this case, the potential exhibits a double-peak structure, with the modified potential appearing beside the gravitational perturbation potential. We also examine the impact of the relevant parameters as well as the influence of the parameter $c_0$, which arises from the equation of motion of the Stueckelberg field. For a large value of $a_1$, the two peaks of the potentials are close together, while $c_0$ affects the amplitude and decay rate of the time-domain waveform, resulting in no echoes. For small values of $a_1$, the peaks of the potentials are widely separated and $c_0$ influences both the phase and the amplitude of the echoes. In addition, the quasinormal frequencies of the black hole are also calculated using both the WKB and Prony methods. As results, these provide a potential avenue for testing deviations from GR and probing possible signatures of quantum gravity through future GWs observations.",
