New submissions,Supervised Extraction of the Thermal Sunyaev$-$Zel'dovich Effect with a Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network,"Cameron T. Pratt,Zhijie Qu,Joel N. Bregman",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The thermal Sunyaev$-$Zel'dovich (SZ) effect offers a unique probe of the hot and diffuse universe that could help close the missing baryon problem. Traditional extractions of the SZ effect, however, exhibit systematic noise that may lead to unreliable results. In this work, we provide an alternative solution using a three-dimensional Attention Nested U-Net trained end-to-end with supervised learning. Our labeled data consists of simulated SZ signals injected into $\textit{Planck}$ frequency maps, allowing our model to learn how to extract SZ signals in the presence of realistic noise. We implement a curriculum learning scheme that gradually exposed the model to weaker SZ signals. The absence/presence of curriculum learning significantly impacted the amount of bias and variance present in the reconstructed SZ signal. The results from our method were comparable to those from the popular $\textit{needlet internal linear combination}$ (NILC) method when evaluated on simulated data as well as real-world SZ signals. We conclude by discussing future avenues for advancing machine learning extractions of SZ signals.",
New submissions,Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $Λ$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum,"Anton Chudaykin,Mikhail M. Ivanov,Oliver H. E. Philcox",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory (EFT)-based full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, carefully accounting for all relevant systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform an EFT-based full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $h=0.707\pm 0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10$\% and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $h=0.688\pm 0.006$, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Finally, the galaxy bispectrum data dramatically improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.",
New submissions,Dwarf Galaxies at Cosmic Noon: New JWST Constraints on Satellite Models and Subhalo Tidal Evolution,"Jenny T. Wan(1 and 2),Philip Mansfield(1),Katherine A. Suess(3),Yunchong Wang(1, 2, and 4),Sihan Yuan(1 and 4),Christina C. Williams(5),Risa H. Wechsler(1, 2, and 4) ((1) Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics &amp; Cosmology, (2) Stanford University, (3) University of Colorado, Boulder, (4) SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, (5) NSF National Optical-Infrared Research Laboratory)",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The advent of JWST has revolutionized the study of faint satellite galaxies at $z \gtrsim 1$, enabling statistical constraints on galaxy evolution and the galaxy$-$halo connection in a previously unexplored mass and redshift regime. We compare satellite abundances at $1 < z < 3.5$ from recent JWST observations with predictions from cosmological dark matter-only zoom-in simulations. We identify and quantify several sources of biases that can impact theoretical satellite counts, finding that assumptions about subhalo tidal evolution introduce the largest uncertainty in predictions for the satellite mass function. Using a flexible galaxy disruption model, we explore a range of disruption scenarios, spanning hydrodynamically motivated and idealized prescriptions, to bracket plausible physical outcomes. We show that varying galaxy durability can change the predicted satellite mass functions by a factor of $\sim3.5$. The JWST data and our fiducial model are consistent within $1-2\sigma$ across the full redshift ($1 < z < 3.5$) and stellar mass ($M_\star> 10^7~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) range probed. We find evidence that subhalos are at least as long-lived as predicted by hydrodynamic simulations. Our framework will enable robust constraints on the tidal evolution of subhalos with future observations. This work presents the first direct comparison between cosmological models and observations of the high-redshift satellite population in this low-mass regime. These results showcase JWST's emerging power to test structure formation in the first half of the Universe in a new domain and to constrain the physical processes driving the evolution of low-mass galaxies across cosmic time.",
New submissions,Lensing without mass: The matter density profile in cosmic voids from UNIONS,"Hunter L. Martin,Michael J. Hudson,Alex Woodfinden,Lucie Baumont,Thomas de Boer,Pierre A. Burger,Jack Elvin-Poole,Sébastien Fabbro,Samuel Farrens,Sacha Guerrini,Axel Guinot,Fabian Hervas-Peters,Hendrik Hildebrandt,Martin Kilbinger,Ludovic van Waerbeke,Anna Wittje",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We measure the distribution of matter contained within the emptiest regions of the Universe: cosmic voids. We use the large overlap between the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) and voids identified in the LOWZ and CMASS catalogues of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) to constrain the excess surface mass density of voids using weak lensing. We present and validate a novel method for computing the Gaussian component of the conventional weak lensing covariance, adapted for use with void studies. We detect the stacked weak lensing void density profile at the $6.2\sigma$ level, the most significant detection of void lensing from spectroscopically-identified voids to date. We find that large and small voids have different matter density profiles, as expected from numerical studies of void profiles. This difference is significant at the $2.3\sigma$ level. Comparing the void profile to a measurement of the void-galaxy cross-correlation to test the linearity of the relationship between mass and light, we find good visual agreement between the two, and a galaxy bias factor of $2.45\pm0.36$, consistent with other works. This work represents a promising detection of the lensing effect from underdensities, with the goal of promoting its development into a competitive cosmological probe.",
New submissions,Equation of state during (p)reheating with trilinear interactions,"Stefan Antusch,Kenneth Marschall,Francisco Torrenti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We characterize the post-inflationary evolution of the equation of state of the universe from the end of inflation until the onset of radiation domination, when the inflaton is coupled to a daughter field through a trilinear interaction. We consider an inflaton potential that is quadratic near the minimum and flattens in the inflationary regime. By simulating the dynamics in 2+1-dimensional lattices, we have tracked the long-term evolution of the equation of state for about ten e-folds of expansion, for various coupling strengths. The trilinear interaction initially excites daughter field modes through a process of tachyonic resonance immediately after inflation and triggers a temporary deviation of the equation of state from $\bar{w} = 0$ to a maximum value $\bar{w} = \bar{w}_{\rm max} < 1/3$. However, at much later times, the inflaton homogeneous mode once again dominates the energy density, pushing the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ until the onset of perturbative reheating. By combining the lattice results with a Boltzmann approach, we characterize the entire post-inflationary expansion history, which allows to calculate precise predictions for the inflationary CMB observables. We also accurately compute the redshift of the stochastic gravitational wave background produced during preheating, and show that taking the temporary return of the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ into account can reduce the amplitude by many orders of magnitude relative to previous estimates.",
New submissions,Simulation-based inference with deep ensembles: Evaluating calibration uncertainty and detecting model misspecification,"James Alvey,Carlo R. Contaldi,Mauro Pieroni",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) offers a principled and flexible framework for conducting Bayesian inference in any situation where forward simulations are feasible. However, validating the accuracy and reliability of the inferred posteriors remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we point out a simple diagnostic approach rooted in ensemble learning methods to assess the internal consistency of SBI outputs that does not require access to the true posterior. By training multiple neural estimators under identical conditions and evaluating their pairwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, we define a consistency criterion that quantifies agreement across the ensemble. We highlight two core use cases for this framework: a) for generating a robust estimate of the systematic uncertainty in parameter reconstruction associated with the training procedure, and b) for detecting possible model misspecification when using trained estimators on real data. We also demonstrate the relationship between significant KL divergences and issues such as insufficient convergence due to, e.g., too low a simulation budget, or intrinsic variance in the training process. Overall, this ensemble-based diagnostic framework provides a lightweight, scalable, and model-agnostic tool for enhancing the trustworthiness of SBI in scientific applications.",
New submissions,Exploring Direct Detection of Massive Particles Using Wave Propagation from Gravitational Coupling with a Wire Under Tension,"Thomas Belvin,Peter Shawhan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the feasibility of detecting galactic orbit dark matter passing through Earth by measuring its gravitational coupling with a wire under tension. We do so by exploring the transverse and longitudinal waves induced on the wire to detect a massive particle passing within $\sim 1$ m of the wire. The particle's $r^{-2}$ interaction with the wire provides an initial momentum which develops into a propagating wave carrying a distinctive time dependent displacement. Most interestingly, we find that both transverse and longitudinal waves develop with unique profiles, allowing for a full, three dimensional reconstruction of the particle's trajectory and its mass over velocity ratio. We find that, at interaction distances of 0.1 to 100 mm with a 90 micron diameter copper beryllium wire, Planck scale dark matter with mass $\sim 10^{19}$ GeV/$c^2$ would create immeasurable displacements on the scale of $10^{-24}$ to $10^{-26}$ m. In order to create displacements detectable by modern, commercially available, displacement sensors on the nanometer scale we require dark matter with a particle mass greater than $4 \times 10^7$ kg ($\sim 2 \times 10^{32}$ GeV/$c^2$). This is outside the upper limit of the Planck scale by 13 orders of magnitude and would also have such a low particle flux that a detection event would be implausible. Finally, we perform a similar analysis for a charged wire and an elementary charged particle with their electrostatic interaction, finding that a sufficiently slow charged particle would produce a transverse displacement comparable to the sensitivity of currently available sensors.",
New submissions,"Microlensing optical depth, event rate, and limits on compact objects in dark matter based on 20 years of OGLE observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud","P. Mróz,A. Udalski,M.K. Szymański,I. Soszyński,P. Pietrukowicz,S. Kozłowski,R. Poleski,J. Skowron,D. Skowron,K. Ulaczyk,M. Gromadzki,K. Rybicki,P. Iwanek,M. Wrona,M. Ratajczak",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.",
New submissions,Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae data,"Tian-Nuo Li,Guo-Hong Du,Peng-Ju Wu,Jing-Zhao Qi,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.",
New submissions,Investigating $f(R)$-Inflation: background evolution and constraints,"Elisa Fazzari,Chiara De Leo,Giovanni Montani,Matteo Martinelli,Alessandro Melchiorri,Guadalupe Cañas-Herrera",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we investigate the possibility of generating an inflationary mechanism within the framework of a metric-$f(R)$ modified gravity theory, formulated in the Jordan frame. We explore whether the scalar field, non-minimally coupled to gravity and emerging in the Jordan frame, can play the role of the primordial inflaton. Particular attention is devoted to constructing a dynamical scenario in the Jordan frame that exhibits a slow-rolling phase for the scalar field and admits a quasi-de Sitter solution for cosmic evolution. To ensure consistency with the standard cosmological model, we impose a matching condition with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the end of the inflationary phase. Furthermore, to address the problem of the absence of matter after inflation, we consider a radiation-type particle creation process that maintains an approximately constant energy density. We test our theoretical model against background observational data, specifically Pantheon+ calibrated with SH0ES and DESI calibrated with BBN. We asses its viability and discuss implications for alleviating the Hubble constant tension.",
New submissions,Two-loop renormalization and running of galaxy bias,"Thomas Bakx,Mathias Garny,Henrique Rubira,Zvonimir Vlah",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We systematically extend the framework of galaxy bias renormalization to two-loop order. For the minimal complete basis of 29 deterministic bias operators up to fifth order in the density field and at leading order in gradient expansion we explicitly work out one- and two-loop renormalization. The latter is provided in terms of double-hard limits of bias kernels, which we find to depend on only one function of the ratio of the loop momenta. After including stochasticity in terms of composite operator renormalization, we apply the framework to the two-loop power spectrum of biased tracers and provide a simple result suitable for numerical evaluation. In addition, we work out one- and two-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) for deterministic bias coefficients related to bias operators constructed from a smoothed density field, generalizing previous works. We identify a linear combination of bias operators with enhanced UV sensitivity, related to a positive eigenvalue of the RGE. Finally, we present an analogy with the RGE as used in quantum field theory, suggesting that a resummation of large logarithms as employed in the latter may also yield useful applications in the study of large-scale galaxy bias.",
New submissions,Exotic Dark Matter and the DESI Anomaly,"Matteo Braglia,Xingang Chen,Abraham Loeb",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Exotic dark matter (EDM) refers to a dark matter species whose equation of state deviates from zero at late times. This behavior enables it to model a variety of non-standard late-time cosmologies, offering alternatives to various dark energy (DE) models, especially when the DE sector violates the null energy condition. In this work, by fitting to CMB, BAO, and Supernovae (SNe) data and comparing models in a Bayesian approach, we show that simple models of exotic dark matter are statistically comparable to the $w_0w_a$CDM DE model in explaining the recent anomaly in the late-time cosmological evolution suggested by DESI and supernova observations, although in both classes of models the evidence against the $\Lambda$CDM model only appears when the DES-Y5 or Union3 SNe dataset is included. The value of $H_0$ remains similar to that in the DE model, except in the no-SNe case, where the DE model predicts lower values than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby worsening the Hubble tension, whereas the EDM models yield values closer to that of $\Lambda$CDM, albeit with larger uncertainty. In addition, the EDM models predict a drastically different energy budget for the present-day universe compared to the standard model, and provide an explanation for a coincident problem in the DE-model explanation of the DESI anomaly.",
New submissions,Testing Signatures of Phantom Crossing through Full-Shape Galaxy Clustering Analysis,"Emanuelly Silva,Rafael C. Nunes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\sim 5\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \sim 0.4$--$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.",
New submissions,Two dynamical scenarios for the binned Master sample interpretation,"Giovanni Montani,Elisa Fazzari,Nakia Carlevaro,Maria Giovanna Dainotti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze two different scenarios for the late Universe dynamics, resulting into Hubble parameters deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM, mainly for the presence of an additional free parameter, which is the dark energy parameter. The first model consists of a pure evolutionary dark energy paradigm, as result of its creation by the gravitational field of the expanding Universe. The second model also considers an interaction of the evolutionary dark energy with the matter component, postulated via the conservation of the sum of their ideal energy-momentum tensors. These two models are then compared \textit{via} the diagnostic tool of the effective running Hubble constant, with the binned data of the so-called ``Master sample'' for the Type Ia Supernovae. The comparison procedures, based on a standard MCMC analysis, led to a clear preference of data for the dark energy - matter interaction model, which is associated to a phantom matter equation of state parameter (very close to $-1$) when, being left free by data (it has a flat posterior), it is fixed in order to reproduce the decreasing power-law behavior of the effective running Hubble constant, already discussed in literature.",
New submissions,A spherical hydrodynamical model of cosmic voids in ΛCDM and beyond,"Tommaso Moretti,Giovanni Verza,Noemi Frusciante,Franceso Pace",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmic voids have emerged as powerful probes for cosmology, providing complementary information on the large-scale structure of the universe. We present the first application of a hydrodynamical framework to model the evolution of cosmic voids. This approach offers a physically intuitive characterization of void dynamics and can naturally be applied to non-standard cosmologies. We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear (Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density contrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void statistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the shell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby extending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe.Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we investigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and $w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically symmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0 $, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%. Variations in $w_a$ have a smaller impact, but may still lead to measurable effects. We also show that the cosmology-dependent mapping between linear and non-linear density contrasts may provide a sensitive probe of dynamical dark energy in precision void analyses.",
New submissions,Missing baryons recovered: a measurement of the gas fraction in galaxies and groups with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and CMB lensing,"Boryana Hadzhiyska,Simone Ferraro,Gerrit S. Farren,Noah Sailer,Rongpu Zhou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present new constraints on the halo masses and matter density profiles of DESI galaxy groups by cross-correlating samples of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) galaxies with the publicly available CMB lensing convergence map from ACT DR6. This provides an independent, lensing-based calibration of halo masses, complementary to methods relying on clustering or dynamics. We derive constraints on the mean halo mass for three DESI-selected samples, finding $\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h)) \approx 13.18$, 13.03 and 13.02 for the Main LRG, Extended LRG, and BGS samples, respectively. Using a halo model approach, we also compare the projected galaxy-matter density profiles with previously reported gas profiles inferred from measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. This work addresses one of the key uncertainties in interpreting kSZ signals -- the unknown host halo mass distribution -- by providing an independent and consistent mass calibration. The agreement between the gas and total mass profiles at large aperture suggests that sufficiently far from the group center (2--3 virial radii), we recover all the baryons, offering a resolution to the 'missing baryon' problem. We further study the cumulative gas fractions for all galaxies as well as for the most massive galaxy groups in the sample ($\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h)) \approx 13.5$), finding values that are physically sensible and in agreement with previous findings using kSZ and X-ray data: compared to the TNG300 simulation, the observed gas fractions are systematically lower at fixed radius by $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$, providing compelling, independent evidence for stronger baryonic feedback in the real Universe. These findings highlight the power of combining CMB lensing with galaxy surveys to probe the interplay between baryons and dark matter in group-sized halos.",
Cross submissions,Freeze-in gravitational waves and dark matter in warm inflation,"Quan Chen,Siyu Jiang,Dayun Qiu,Peilin Chen,Fa Peng Huang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent study[1] has suggested that warm inflation may be realized with Standard Model gauge interaction alone. Motivated by this framework, we investigate the gravitational wave spectrum and graviton-portal dark matter production through the freeze-in process generated during warm inflation scenarios. We perform a comparative analysis for different dissipation terms, focusing on their distinct gravitational wave signatures in the high-frequency regime. Our findings reveal qualitative and quantitative differences in the spectral behavior, offering a preliminary pathway for discriminating among various inflationary and dark matter models through high-frequency gravitational wave signals.",
