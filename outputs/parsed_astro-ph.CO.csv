New submissions,"Complete Sampling of the $uv$ Plane with Realistic Radio Arrays: Introducing the RULES Algorithm, with Application to 21 cm Foreground Wedge Removal","Vincent MacKay,Zhilei Xu,Ruby Byrne,Jacqueline Hewitt",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We introduce the Radio-array $uv$ Layout Engineering Strategy (RULES), an algorithm for designing radio arrays that achieve complete coverage of the $uv$ plane, defined as, at minimum, regular sampling at half the observing wavelength ($\lambda$) along the $u$ and $v$ axes within a specified range of baseline lengths. Using RULES, we generate $uv$-complete layouts that cover the range $10\lambda\leq|(u,v)|\leq 100\lambda$ with fewer than 1000 antennas of diameter $5\lambda$, comparable to current and planned arrays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such arrays for mitigating contamination from bright astrophysical foregrounds in 21 cm Epoch of Reionization observations,particularly in the region of Fourier space known as the foreground wedge,by simulating visibilities of foreground-like sky models over the 130-150 MHz band and processing them through an image-based power spectrum estimator. We find that with complete $uv$ coverage, the wedge power is suppressed by sixteen orders of magnitude compared to an array with a compact hexagonal layout (used as a reference for a sparse $uv$ coverage). In contrast, we show that an array with the same number of antennas but in a random configuration only suppresses the wedge by three orders of magnitude, despite sampling more distinct $uv$ points over the same range. We address real-world challenges and find that our results are sensitive to small antenna position errors and missing baselines, while still performing equally or significantly better than random arrays in any case. We propose ways to mitigate those challenges such as a minimum redundancy requirement or tighter $uv$ packing density.",
New submissions,Cold and fuzzy dark sector,"Christian Capanelli,Elisa G.M. Ferreira,Evan McDonough",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We introduce the Fuzzy Dark Sector (FDS) scenario as a rich, interacting system and candidate for dark matter. This serves as a natural extension of the single-component, non-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) paradigm. Concretely, we consider an ultra-light Abelian-Higgs model, with interacting Higgs and dark photon degrees of freedom. We find that the transfer function, and hence imprint on the CMB and Large-Scale Structure (LSS), is characterized by a single characteristic scale of the interacting fuzzy dark sector, allowing us to recover the LSS signature of single-field FDM, dependent on the FDS parameters. In contrast, galactic halos present a great diversity, unlike with the universality of single-field FDM, owing to the interaction between fields. This interaction introduces an instability that is not otherwise present for the case of four decoupled scalars. Finally, we comment on primordial production and portals to the Standard Model, and introduce another simple realization of the Fuzzy Dark Sector paradigm with a kinetic coupling.",
New submissions,DESI DR1 Ly$α$ forest: 3D full-shape analysis and cosmological constraints,"Andrei Cuceu,Hiram K. Herrera-Alcantar,Calum Gordon,César Ramírez-Pérez,E. Armengaud,A. Font-Ribera,J. Guy,B. Joachimi,P. Martini,S. Nadathur,I. Pérez-Ràfols,J. Rich,J. Aguilar,S. Ahlen,A. Anand,S. Bailey,A. Bault,D. Bianchi,A. Brodzeller,D. Brooks,J. Chaves-Montero,T. Claybaugh,K. S.

Sinigaglia,D. Sprayberry,T. Tan,G. Tarlé,M. Walther,B. A. Weaver,C. Yèche,R. Zhou,H. Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We perform an analysis of the full shapes of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest correlation functions measured from the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis focuses on measuring the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the cosmic growth rate times the amplitude of matter fluctuations in spheres of $8$ $h^{-1}\text{Mpc}$, $f\sigma_8$. We validate our measurements using two different sets of mocks, a series of data splits, and a large set of analysis variations, which were first performed blinded. Our analysis constrains the ratio $D_M/D_H(z_\mathrm{eff})=4.525\pm0.071$, where $D_H=c/H(z)$ is the Hubble distance, $D_M$ is the transverse comoving distance, and the effective redshift is $z_\mathrm{eff}=2.33$. This is a factor of $2.4$ tighter than the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) constraint from the same data. When combining with Ly$\alpha$ BAO constraints from DESI DR2, we obtain the ratios $D_H(z_\mathrm{eff})/r_d=8.646\pm0.077$ and $D_M(z_\mathrm{eff})/r_d=38.90\pm0.38$, where $r_d$ is the sound horizon at the drag epoch. We also measure $f\sigma_8(z_\mathrm{eff}) = 0.37\; ^{+0.055}_{-0.065} \,(\mathrm{stat})\, \pm 0.033 \,(\mathrm{sys})$, but we do not use it for cosmological inference due to difficulties in its validation with mocks. In $\Lambda$CDM, our measurements are consistent with both cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy clustering constraints. Using a nucleosynthesis prior but no CMB anisotropy information, we measure the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 68.3\pm 1.6\;\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ within $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we show that Ly$\alpha$ forest AP measurements can help improve constraints on the dark energy equation of state, and are expected to play an important role in upcoming DESI analyses.",
New submissions,Quintessential inflation studied through Semiclassical Methods,"Jordan Zambrano,Miguel Agama,Marcos Garzón,Werner Bramer-Escamilla,Clara Rojas,Teófilo Vargas",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we solved the scalar and tensor perturbation equations numerically and using the improved uniform approximation method together with the third-order phase-integral method, for the $\alpha$-attractor inflationary model. This inflationary model has become very important because it allows us to describe the initial accelerated expansion of the universe in the inflationary epoch, and the current accelerated expansion with the same potential that depends on one scalar field $\varphi$. Once the equations for the scalar and tensor power spectra are found, we calculate the observables: the scalar-to-tensor ratio $r$, and the scalar spectral index $n_S$, concluding that semiclassical methods give excellent results compared to numerical integration. We also compare both observables in the $\alpha$-attractor and the Starobinsky inflationary model.",
New submissions,CosmoGen: a cosmological model generator,"D. Castelão,I. Tereno",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of the physical Universe suffers from well-known conceptual problems and is challenged by observational data. Alternative models exist in the literature, both phenomenological and physically motivated, many of them suffering from similar or new problems. We propose a method to mechanically generate alternative models in a procedure informed by data and tuned to mitigate specific problems. We implement a computational framework, dubbed CosmoGen, that integrates evolutionary algorithms for symbolic regression, with computation of structure formation and background cosmological quantities that are used to guide the evolutionary process. As a proof-of-concept we apply the procedure to the specific case of dark energy fluid models, and ask the framework to generate models capable of alleviating the cosmological tensions $S_8$ and $H_0$. The system generates models with high fitness values, and through a Bayesian analysis of an illustrative model, we show that the model indeed alleviates the tensions.",
New submissions,Search for cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission from local galaxy clusters using Fermi-LAT data,"Judit Pérez-Romero,Mattia di Mauro,Rémi Adam,Miguel Á. Sánchez-Conde,Gabrijela Zaharijas",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. Even if clusters are nearly virialized structures, they undergo merging processes, creating merging shocks, and suffer from feedback from galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei; causing complex turbulent motions and amplifying their magnetic fields. These processes act as acceleration mechanisms for the plasma of the intracluster medium (ICM), originating a population of cosmic rays (CRs). Leptonic CRs have long been detected, but we should also expect a CR hadronic population that, through interactions with the ICM, should produce neutral pions that decay into gamma-rays. The detection of diffuse gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters is one of the long-awaited milestones for the high-energy astroparticle physics community. Still, no unambiguous detection has yet been obtained. In this talk, we will present the results of a combined cluster analysis searching for CR-induced gamma-ray signals, using 16 years of Fermi-LAT data. In our previous work (di Mauro et al. 2023) we obtained from the combined analysis of 49 local galaxy clusters (12 years of data) a hint of signal between 2.5-3 sigma. These results are consistent with other works as well, which consistently find a non-vanishing hint of signal, around the detection threshold. In this new work, we use a sample of near, well-known galaxy clusters and develop CR-induced emission templates using well-established X-ray measurements for calibration, assuming self similarity for the members of our sample. To strengthen the robustness of our analysis, we define benchmark models to encapsulate the uncertainties in the spectral and spatial profiles for the CR-induced emission and perform the standard template-fitting analysis using the likelihood ratio test.",
New submissions,Fast and accurate Gaia-unWISE quasar mock catalogs from LPT and Eulerian bias,"Francesco Sinigaglia,Francisco-Shu Kitaura,Mahlet Shiferaw,Ginevra Favole,Kate Storey-Fisher,Nestor Arsenov",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present $100$ full-sky quasar spectrophotometric mock catalogs with smooth redshift evolution from $z=0$ to $z\sim 4$, tailored to analyze the Gaia-unWISE Quasar Catalog (Quaia). In particular, we apply a novel hierarchical nonlocal nonlinear bias scheme (Hicobian) to dark matter fields generated through Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory on the lightcone (WebON code), calibrating the free parameters of the bias model on Abacus quasar HOD mock catalogs tuned to reproduce DESI Early Data Release observations in real and redshift space. After having obtained such accurate spectroscopic catalogs, we inject in the mocks the observational effects characterizing the Quaia catalog: (i) spectrophotometric redshift uncertainties, (ii) the angular selection function, and (iii) the redshift number counts distribution. We assess the accuracy of our catalogs by validating a number of summary statistics: the full-sky QSO maps, the redshift uncertainty distributions as a function of redshift, the redshift $n(z)$ distribution, the angular power spectra and their normalized covariance matrices, and the angular two-point correlation functions. We find excellent agreement between these metrics from the mocks and from the Quaia catalog. We publicly release the mock catalogs to the community.",
New submissions,The 21cm-galaxy cross-correlation: Realistic forecast for 21cm signal detection and reionisation constraints,"Anne Hutter,Caroline Heneka",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"21cm-galaxy cross-correlation will play a key role in confirming the cosmological 21cm signal. We investigate which survey configurations detect the 21cm-LAE cross-correlation signal, and assess its ability to distinguish reionisation scenarios. Our pipeline computes observational uncertainties for the 21cm-galaxy cross-power spectrum, accounting for key survey parameters: the field of view (FoV), limiting luminosity of galaxy surveys $L_\alpha$, redshift uncertainty $\sigma_z$, and 21cm foreground wedge assumptions. We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the 21cm-Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) cross-power spectrum for two scenarios: one where reionisation is driven by faint or by bright galaxies. We find: (i) SNR increases with larger FoV, fainter $L_\alpha$, and smaller $\sigma_z$, with the FoV having the strongest impact when $\sigma_z$ is small. (ii) Under a moderate foreground wedge, photometric-like surveys yield insufficient SNR, and medium-deep ($L_\alpha\gtrsim10^{42.5}$erg s$^{-1}$), wide-area (FoV>20deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys are needed. (iii) Under an optimistic foreground wedge, detection is possible with deep ($L_\alpha\gtrsim10^{42.3}$erg s$^{-1}$), wide-area (FoV$\gtrsim80$deg$^2$) photometric-like or shallower, small-area (FoV$\simeq2-3$deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys. (iv) To distinguish the two reionisation scenarios at z=7, moderate foreground wedge scenarios require deep-wide spectroscopic surveys; under an optimistic foreground wedge, shallower, medium-area (FoV$\simeq10$deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys suffice. (v) Maximising the SNR for detection and model discrimination requires sampling the large-scale peak of the cross-power spectrum, which shifts to larger physical scales as reionisation proceeds and the less ionisation fronts follow the gas density - making surveys at z>7 more promising despite lower galaxy number densities.",
New submissions,Analytic derivation of GW spectrum from bubble collisions in FLRW Universe,Masaki Yamada,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We generalize the analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum from bubble collisions during a cosmological first-order phase transition, under the thin-wall and envelope approximations, by incorporating the effect of cosmic expansion in the FLRW metric. Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the flat-spacetime limit. The latter expansion reveals that the flat-spacetime approximation breaks down for $\beta / H_* \lesssim 10$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion. Furthermore, the next-to-leading-order term contributes about a $10\%$ correction for $\beta / H_* \sim 140$, a typical value for the electroweak phase transition.",
New submissions,Expected Constraints on the Intergalactic Magnetic Field using Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory,"Ténéman Keita,Renaud Belmont,Thierry Stolarczyk",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The InterGalactic Magnetic Field (IGMF), which could permeate the cosmic voids but was never detected so far, is considered a relic of the early Universe. Constraints on its strength $B$ can be derived from its influence on time-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the electromagnetic cascades along their path to the Earth. The present lower limit achieved on its intensity is $10^{-18}\;\mathrm{G}$. In this work, we simulate data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), accounting for realistic observational constraints, and we apply a joint spectral and temporal fit to characterize the IGMF. GRBs 190114C and 221009A are used as test cases to assess the sensitivity of CTAO. They demonstrate that a broad range of IGMF strengths can be probed with a lower bound as high as $10^{-15}\;\mathrm{G}$. Notably, we show that observations by the CTAO first large telescope, LST-1, already allow us to exclude field strengths up to $3\times 10^{-17}\;\mathrm{G}$.",
New submissions,Lensed stars in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing -- a JWST prediction for the Cosmic Horseshoe,"Sung Kei Li,Luke Weisenbach,Thomas E. Collett,Jose M. Diego,Jeremy Lim,Thomas J. Broadhurst,Alex Chow,Wolfgang J.R. Enzi,Patrick L. Kelly,Carlos R. Melo-Carneiro,Jose M. Palencia,Liliya L.R. Williams,Jiashuo Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We explore for the first time the possibility of detecting lensed star transients in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems upon repeated, deep imaging using the {\it James-Webb Space Telescope} ({\it JWST}). Our calculation predicts that the extremely high recent star formation rate of $\sim 100\,M_{\odot}\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ over the last 50 Myr (not accounting for image multiplicity) in the ``Cosmic Horseshoe'' lensed system ($z = 2.381$) generates many young, bright stars, of which their large abundance is expected to lead to a detection rate of $\sim 60$ transients per pointing in {\it JWST} observations with a $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\sim 29\,m_{AB}$. With the high expected detection rate and little room for uncertainty for the lens model compared with cluster lenses, our result suggests that the Cosmic Horseshoe could be an excellent tool to test the nature of Dark Matter based on the spatial distribution of transients, and can be used to constrain axion mass if Dark Matter is constituted of ultra-light axions. We also argue that the large distance modulus of $\sim46.5\,$mag at $z \approx 2.4$ can act as a filter to screen out less massive stars as transients and allow one to better constrain the high-mass end of the stellar initial mass function based on the transient detection rate. Follow-up {\it JWST} observations of the Cosmic Horseshoe with would allow one to better probe the nature of Dark Matter and the star formation properties, such as the initial mass function at the cosmic noon, via lensed star transients.",
New submissions,Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy,"Raphaël Kou,Antony Lewis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w<-1$.We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations, and the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour by construction. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find differences with CPL that are typically at the few-percent level. As a result, we forecast that even stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will have limited power to discriminate between our UDF and CPL at the linear level. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios.Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DESY5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. This highlights that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without a phantom component.",
New submissions,Cosmographic Footprints of Dynamical Dark Energy,"Elisa Fazzari,William Giarè,Eleonora Di Valentino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We introduce a novel cosmographic framework to trace the late-time kinematics of the Universe without assuming any underlying dynamics. The method relies on generalized Padé-$(2,1)$ expansions around arbitrary pivot redshifts, which, compared to state-of-the-art calculations, reduce truncation errors by up to two orders of magnitude at high redshift and yield more precise constraints by defining cosmographic parameters exactly where the data lie. This avoids extrapolations, mitigates degeneracies, and enables a clean disentangling of their effects. Using the latest low-redshift datasets, we center the generalized expansion in multiple bins across $z\in[0,1]$ and obtain precise constraints on the redshift evolution of cosmographic parameters. We find that all key parameters deviate from their $\Lambda$CDM predictions in a redshift-dependent way that can be naturally explained within dynamical Dark Energy scenarios. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ follows a redshift evolution consistent with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, while the generalized $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows deviations of up to $\sim4\sigma$ from the constant $\Lambda$CDM expectation, closely matching the CPL predictions. Taken together, these results point to footprints of dynamical Dark Energy in the kinematics of the Universe at $z\lesssim 1$.",
New submissions,"Sound-Horizon-Agnostic Inference of the Hubble Constant and Neutrino Mass from BAO, CMB Lensing, and Galaxy Weak Lensing and Clustering","Helena García Escudero,Seyed Hamidreza Mirpoorian,Levon Pogosian",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a sound-horizon-agnostic determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, by combining DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data with the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing measurements from Planck, ACT, and SPT-3G, the angular size of the CMB acoustic scale, Dark Energy Survey Year-3 ($3\times2$-pt) galaxy weak lensing and clustering correlations, and the Pantheon+ supernova sample. In this analysis, the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, is treated as a free parameter, avoiding assumptions about early-Universe physics. By combining uncalibrated comoving distances from BAO and supernovae with constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ from CMB and galaxy lensing/clustering, we break the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy and obtain $H_0 = 70.0 \pm 1.7$ km/s/Mpc when the sum of the neutrino masses is fixed at $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.06$ eV. With a conservative prior on the amplitude of primordial fluctuations, $A_s$, we find $H_0 = 70.03 \pm 0.97$ km/s/Mpc and $r_d = 144.8 \pm 1.6$ Mpc. Allowing $\Sigma m_\nu$ to vary yields $H_0 = 75.3^{+3.3}_{-4.0}$ km/s/Mpc and $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.55^{+0.23}_{-0.37}$ ($<1.11$ eV) at 68% (95%) CL, and $H_0 = 73.9 \pm 2.2$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.46^{+0.21}_{-0.25}$ ($=0.46^{+0.40}_{-0.45}$ eV) at 68% (95%) CL when a prior on $A_s$ is applied. Forecasts for the completed DESI BAO program, combined with Simons-Observatory-like CMB lensing, next-generation $3\times2$-pt data, and expanded supernova samples predict $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 0.67$ km/s/Mpc with fixed $\Sigma m_\nu$, and $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 1.1$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu < 0.133$ ($<0.263$) eV at 68% (95%) CL when the neutrino mass is varied. As the precision of BAO, CMB lensing, and galaxy lensing/clustering improve, this $r_d$-agnostic framework will provide an independent test of the need for new physics at recombination.",
Cross submissions,Searching for dark photon dark matter from terrestrial magnetic fields,"Kimihiro Nomura,Atsushi Nishizawa,Atsushi Taruya,Yoshiaki Himemoto",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a novel search for dark photon dark matter (DM) using terrestrial magnetic field measurements at frequencies below 100 Hz. Coherently oscillating dark photon DM can induce a monochromatic magnetic field via kinetic mixing with ordinary photons. Notably, for dark photon masses $m_{A'}$ around $3 \times 10^{-14}$ eV, the signal can be resonantly amplified within a cavity formed by the Earth's surface and the ionosphere. We compute the expected signal incorporating the effect of atmospheric conductivity, and derive new upper limits on the kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ from long-term geomagnetic data. These limits improve upon previous ground-based constraints in the mass range of $1 \times 10^{-15}$ eV $\lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-13}$ eV.",
Cross submissions,Superconducting Strings in $E_6$,"Rinku Maji,Qaisar Shafi",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We discuss the appearance of superconducting strings in $E_6$ grand unification, keeping track of the magnetic monopole flux that precedes the formation of the string flux tube. This flux matching ensures compatibility with the quantum tunneling of a monopole-antimonopole pair on a metastable string. We identify two realistic $E_6$ models with superconducting (metastable) strings that also carry zero modes of the right handed Majorana neutrinos and dark matter particles. Depending on the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable gravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Topologically stable superconducting strings also appear if the $E_6$ symmetry breaking leaves unbroken the $Z_2$ subgroup of $Z_4$, the center of $SO(10)$. The zero modes of the SM fermions are the charge carriers in this case. Finally, the flux matching condition ensures that the Aharanov-Bohm phase change in going around the metastable strings is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ for all fields. The fields in the spinorial representation of SO(10) acquire a phase change of $\exp(\pm i\pi)$ if taken around the topologically stable $Z_2$ string.",
