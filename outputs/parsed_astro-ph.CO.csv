New submissions,Identifying Microlensing by Compact Dark Matter through Diffraction Patterns in Gravitational Waves with Machine Learning,"Ao Liu,Tonghua Liu,Dejiang Li,Cuihong Wen,Jieci Wang,Kai Liao,Jiaxing Cui,Huan Zhou",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational wave lensing, particularly microlensing by compact dark matter (DM), offers a unique avenue to probe the nature of dark matter. However, conventional detection methods are often computationally expensive, inefficient, and sensitive to waveform systematics. In this work, we introduce the Wavelet Convolution Detector (WCD), a deep learning framework specifically designed to identify wave-optics diffraction patterns imprinted in gravitationally lensed signals. The WCD integrates multi-scale wavelet analysis within residual convolutional blocks to efficiently extract time-frequency interference structures, and is trained on a realistically generated dataset incorporating compact DM mass functions and astrophysical lensing probabilities. This work is the first machine learning-based approach capable of identifying such wave-optics signatures in lensed gravitational waves. Tested on simulated binary black hole events, the model achieves 92.2\% accuracy (AUC=0.965), with performance rising to AUC$\sim$0.99 at high SNR. Crucially, it maintains high discriminative power across a wide range of lens masses without retraining, demonstrating particular strength in the low-impact-parameter and high-lens-mass regimes where wave-optics effects are most pronounced. Compared to Bayesian inference, the WCD provides orders-of-magnitude faster inference, making it a scalable and efficient tool for discovering compact DM through lensed gravitational waves in the era of third-generation detectors.",
New submissions,The resummation model in FLAMINGO: precisely predicting matter power suppression from observed halo baryon fractions,"Marcel P. van Daalen,Ioannis Koutalios,Jeger C. Broxterman,Bart J.H. Wolfs,John C. Helly,Matthieu Schaller,Joop Schaye",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In order to derive unbiased cosmological parameters from Stage-IV surveys, we need models that can predict the matter power spectrum for at least $k\,\lesssim\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with percent-level precision. The main challenge in this endeavour is that baryonic feedback significantly redistributes matter on large scales, but to an unknown degree. Here, we present an improved version of the ""resummation"" model, which maps observed halo baryon fractions of massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{500c}}\gtrsim 10^{12.5}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) to a flexible suppression signal - i.e. the ratio of baryonic to dark-matter-only (DMO) matter power spectra - using zero free parameters. We apply this model to the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, obtaining a typical precision of $\lesssim 1\%$ for $k\,\leq\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ given mean halo baryon fractions within the spherical overdensity radii $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{200m}}$. When only those within $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ are available, we still obtain $\lesssim 2\%$ precision. We show that given small-scale stellar mass fractions, the model can be extended to yield $\lesssim 3\%$ precise suppression signals for all scales measured ($k\,\leq\,25\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$). We also extend the model to redshifts $z>0$. Central to the model is a seemingly mass-independent and feedback-independent relation that allows observed halo masses to be mapped to equivalent DMO halo masses using only observed mean halo baryon fractions, to $\lesssim 1\%$ precision. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to retrieve the DMO halo mass function from observed halo masses and baryon fractions with percent-level precision, without any assumptions on the strength of feedback. A Python package implementing the resummation model is made publicly available.",
New submissions,"Wide binaries in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy: discovery, population modeling, and a nail in the coffin of primordial black hole dark matter","Cheyanne Shariat,Kareem El-Badry,Mario Gennaro,Keyi Ding,Joshua D.

Cohen,Alvio Renzini,Alessandro Savino,Erik J. Tollerud",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Boötes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\rm M_\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\pm0.25\%$ of Boötes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \gtrsim 5~{\rm M_\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\sim1\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.",
New submissions,An emulator-based forecasting on astrophysics and cosmology with 21 cm and density cross-correlations during EoR,Barun Maity,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The 21 cm signal arising from fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen field, and its cross-correlation with other tracers of cosmic density, are promising probes of the high-redshift Universe. In this study, we assess the potential of the 21 cm power spectrum, along with its cross power spectrum with dark matter density and associated bias, to constrain both astrophysics during the reionization era and the underlying cosmology. Our methodology involves emulating these estimators using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space. Utilizing a photon-conserving semi-numerical reionization model, we construct emulators at a fixed redshift ($z = 7.0$) for $k$-modes relevant to upcoming telescopes such as SKA-Low. We generate $\sim7000$ training samples by varying both cosmological and astrophysical parameters along with initial conditions, achieving high accuracy when compared to true simulation outputs. While forecasting, the model involves five free parameters: three cosmological ($\Omega_m$, $h$, $\sigma_8$) and two astrophysical (ionizing efficiency, $\zeta$, and minimum halo mass, $M_{\mathrm{min}}$). Using a fiducial model at the mid-reionization stage, we create a mock dataset and perform forecasting with the trained emulators. Assuming a 5% observational uncertainty combined with emulator error, we find that the 21 cm and 21 cm-density cross power spectra can constrain the Hubble parameter ($h$) to better than 6% at a confidence interval of 95%, with tight constraints on the global neutral fraction ($Q_{\mathrm{HI}}$). The inclusion of bias information further improves constraints on $\sigma_8$ (< 10% at 95% confidence). Finally, robustness tests with two alternate ionization states and a variant with higher observational uncertainty show that the ionization fractions are still reliably recovered, even when cosmological constraints weaken.",
New submissions,Stochastic inflation with gradient interactions,"Vadim Briaud,Ryodai Kawaguchi,Vincent Vennin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Stochastic inflation rests on the separate-universe approximation, i.e. the ability to describe long-wavelength fluctuations in an inflating universe as homogeneous perturbations of its background dynamics. Although this approximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it breaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor phases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to enhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial black holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in such models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of backreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how gradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of Langevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases of interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the classical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from cosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered. We uncover the existence of a ""pullback"" effect by which the tails of the first-passage-time distributions are dampened by gradient interactions. We finally discuss the role of backreaction in the presence of gradient interactions.",
New submissions,Bulk viscosity from early-time thermalization of cosmic fluids in light of DESI DR2 data,"Hermano Velten,William Iania",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"If nonrelativistic dark matter and radiation are allowed to interact, reaching an approximate thermal equilibrium, this interaction induces a bulk viscous pressure changing the effective one-fluid description of the universe dynamics. By modeling such components as perfect fluids, a cosmologically relevant bulk viscous pressure emerges for dark matter particle masses in the range of $1\,\text{eV} - 10\,\text{eV}$ keeping thermal equilibrium with the radiation. Such a transient bulk viscosity introduces significant effects in the expansion rate near the matter-radiation equality (redshift $z_{\text{eq}} \sim 3400$) and at late times (leading to a higher inferred value of the Hubble constant $H_0$). We use the recent DESI DR2 BAO data to place an upper bound on the free parameter of the model $\tau_\text{eq}$ which represents the time scale in which each component follows its own internal perfect fluid dynamics until thermalization occurs. Our main result is encoded in the bound $\tau_\text{eq} < 1.84 \times 10^{-10} $ s (2$\sigma$), with the corresponding dimensionless bulk coefficient $\tilde{\xi} H_0/H_{eq}<5.94\times10^{-4}$ (2$\sigma$). In practice, this rules out any possible interaction between radiation and dark matter prior to the recombination epoch.",
New submissions,Deep-Field Analytical Calibration,"Andy Park,Xiangchong Li,Rachel Mandelbaum,Matthew Becker",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The next generation of imaging surveys, including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Euclid, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, will place unprecedented constraints on cosmology using weak gravitational lensing. To fully exploit their statistical power, shear measurement methods must achieve sub-percent accuracy while mitigating systematic biases from noise, the point-spread function (PSF), blending, and shear-dependent detection. The analytical calibration framework (\texttt{AnaCal}) has demonstrated such accuracy but requires adding noise to images, reducing their effective depth. We introduce Deep-Field Analytical Calibration (\textsc{deep-field~}\texttt{AnaCal}), an extension of \texttt{AnaCal} that leverages deep-field images to compute shear responses while preserving wide-field statistical power. We validate the method on isolated and blended galaxy simulations with LSST-like seeing and noise, showing it meets the stringent requirement of multiplicative bias $|m| < 3\times10^{-3}$ at 99.7% confidence. Relative to standard \texttt{AnaCal} on wide-field images, this method improves effective galaxy number density from $17$ to $30$ arcmin$^{-2}$ for simulated 10-year LSST data. Assuming deep fields with $10\times$ the exposure of wide fields, we find the pixel noise variance in shear estimation is reduced by $30%$ and the overall shear uncertainty by $\sim 25%$. Finally, we assess sample variance impacts using the LSST Deep Drilling Fields strategy, finding an equivalent calibration uncertainty of $\lesssim 0.3%$. These results establish \textsc{deep-field~}\texttt{AnaCal} as a promising approach for shear calibration in upcoming weak lensing surveys.",
New submissions,Efficient evaluation of the dark-matter two-loop power spectrum in the EFT of LSS,"Charalampos Anastasiou,Andrea Favorito,Matthew Lewandowski,Leonardo Senatore,Henry Zheng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Rapid progress in cosmological Large Scale Structure (LSS) surveys motivates precise theoretical predictions. The Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) is routinely applied to data, and requires fast computation of its predictions when sampling the large space of cosmological parameters. Going beyond existing one-loop techniques, we present a method to rapidly evaluate the two-loop power spectrum. Our method decomposes the typically small difference between a given linear power spectrum and a reference power spectrum into a cosmology-independent basis of functions resembling massive scalar propagators in Quantum Field Theory. By taking the leading terms in such a small difference, we numerically evaluate the cosmology-independent loop integrals where in the integrand only the relevant combinations of basis functions appear. We achieve an efficient numerical evaluation via physically motivated local ultraviolet subtractions and by arranging the cancellation of infrared singularities locally in the integrands. Final predictions are obtained by contracting these precomputed integrals with the cosmology-dependent coordinates of the expansion in the fixed basis. We present and publicly release the precomputed integrals for the renormalized two-loop dark-matter power spectrum in the EFTofLSS. These require eight EFT counterterms, which include the effect of generated vorticity, and are sufficient to analyze the lensing galaxy signal in LSS surveys at this order.",
Cross submissions,Prominence: A discriminator of gravitational wave signals,"João Gonçalves,Danny Marfatia,António P. Morais",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The concept of prominence is familiar to signal engineers, topographers and mountaineers. We introduce Prominence $\mathcal P$ as a discriminator of gravitational wave (GW) signals. We treat black hole and neutron star binaries as astrophysical background sources, and show how $\mathcal P$ can be used to distinguish between GW spectra produced by first-order phase transitions, domain walls and cosmic strings, and combinations thereof. Prominence can also be used to discriminate between these and off-piste sources of GWs. The uncertainty in the measured energy density in GWs at Pulsar Timing Arrays needs to be smaller than $\sim 4\%$ for $\mathcal{P}$ to achieve discrimination at 3$\sigma$. LISA and ET data are expected to have sufficiently small uncertainties that Prominence can play a central role in their analysis.",
Cross submissions,II. Non-Linear Interacting Dark Energy: Analytical Solutions and Theoretical Pathologies,"Marcel van der Westhuizen,Amare Abebe,Eleonora Di Valentino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate interacting dark energy (IDE) models with phenomenological, non-linear interaction kernels $Q$, specifically $Q_{1}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm dm}\rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, $Q_{2}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, and $Q_{3}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$. Using dynamical system techniques developed in our companion paper on linear kernels, we derive new conditions that ensure positive and well-defined energy densities, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We find that for $Q_{1}$, all densities remain positive, while for $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ negative values of either DM or DE are unavoidable if energy flows from DM to DE. We also show that for $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ a big rip singularity always arises in the phantom regime $w<-1$, whereas for $Q_{3}$ this fate may be avoided if energy flows from DE to DM. In addition, we provide new exact analytical solutions for $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$ in the cases of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$, and obtain new expressions for the effective equations of state of DM, DE, the total fluid, and the reconstructed dynamical DE equation of state ($w_{\rm dm}^{\rm eff}$, $w_{\rm de}^{\rm eff}$, $w_{\rm tot}^{\rm eff}$, and $\tilde{w}$). Using these results, we discuss phantom crossings, evaluate how each kernel addresses the coincidence problem, and apply statefinder diagnostics to compare the models. These findings extend the theoretical understanding of non-linear IDE models and provide analytical tools for future observational constraints.",
Cross submissions,I. Linear Interacting Dark Energy: Analytical Solutions and Theoretical Pathologies,"Marcel van der Westhuizen,Amare Abebe,Eleonora Di Valentino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Interacting dark energy (IDE) models, in which dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) exchange energy through a non-gravitational interaction, have long been proposed as candidates to address key challenges in modern cosmology. These include the coincidence problem, the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, and, more recently, the hints of dynamical dark energy reported by the DESI collaboration. Given the renewed interest in IDE models, it is crucial to fully understand their parameter space when constraining them observationally, especially with regard to the often-neglected issues of negative energy densities and future big rip singularities. In this work, we present a comparative study of the general linear interaction $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm}\rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de}\rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$. For these five models, we perform a dynamical system analysis and derive new conditions that ensure positive, real, and well-defined energy densities throughout cosmic evolution, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We obtain exact analytical solutions for $\rho_{\rm{dm}}$, $\rho_{\rm{de}}$, the effective equations of state ($w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{dm}}$, $w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{de}}$, $w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{tot}}$), and a reconstructed dynamical DE equation of state $\tilde{w}$. Using these results, we examine phantom crossings, address the coincidence problem, and apply the statefinder diagnostic to distinguish between models. We show that energy transfer from DM to DE inevitably produces negative energy densities and make future singularities more likely, while transfer from DE to DM avoids these pathologies and is thus theoretically favored.",
Cross submissions,"III. Interacting Dark Energy: Summary of Models, Pathologies, and Constraints","Marcel van der Westhuizen,Amare Abebe,Eleonora Di Valentino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present an overview of the main results from our two companion papers that are relevant for observational constraints on interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We provide analytical solutions for the dark matter and dark energy densities, $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$, as well as the normalized Hubble function $h(z)$, for eight IDE models. These include five linear IDE models, namely $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de} \rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$, together with three non-linear IDE models: $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, and $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$. For these eight models, we present conditions to avoid imaginary, undefined, and negative energy densities. In seven of the eight cases, negative densities arise if energy flows from DM to DE, implying a strong theoretical preference for energy transfer from DE to DM. We also provide conditions to avoid future big rip singularities and evaluate how each model addresses the coincidence problem in both the past and the future. Finally, we propose a set of approaches and simplifying assumptions that can be used when constraining IDE models, by defining regimes that restrict the parameter space according to the behavior researchers are willing to tolerate.",
Cross submissions,Genesis--Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT data,"Han Gil Choi,Pavel Petrov,Seong Chan Park",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We propose a novel non-singular cosmological scenario within the framework of Horndeski gravity, consisting of three successive stages: (i) a Genesis phase, in which the Universe slowly expands from an asymptotically flat spacetime; (ii) a brief transition stage restoring General Relativity; and (iii) a Starobinsky inflationary phase. This construction is fully consistent within a viable parameter space: it remains weakly coupled, free from ghost and gradient instabilities, with luminal tensor and subluminal scalar perturbations throughout the entire evolution. Importantly, the Genesis phase induces characteristic corrections to the Starobinsky potential, which cannot be captured by simple $\sum_i c_i R^i$-type modifications. These corrections robustly enhance the scalar spectral index, thereby improving the agreement of Starobinsky inflation with recent CMB measurements, in particular the data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).",
Cross submissions,A dynamical systems perspective on the thermodynamics of late-time cosmology,"Dipayan Mukherjee,Harkirat Singh Sahota,Swati Gavas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A thermodynamic description of cosmological spacetimes may provide insights into the fundamentals of the cosmic evolution that remain otherwise obscure, in close analogy with 'black hole thermodynamics'. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of late-time cosmological evolution using the dynamical systems approach, focusing on the $\Lambda$CDM model and quintessence models with an exponential potential. Thermodynamic quantities obtained through the Hayward-Kodama formalism are mapped onto the phase space of these models, allowing us to investigate thermodynamic stability and phase transitions in a manner independent of the initial condition of the evolution of the universe. In both models, the universe inevitably undergoes a thermodynamic phase transition, marked by diverging specific heats, irrespective of its initial configuration. We further demonstrate that the thermodynamic stability can occur only during an accelerating phase of the universe. However, the necessary stability conditions are never satisfied anywhere in the phase space, rendering both models inherently thermodynamically unstable within the Hayward-Kodama framework. Importantly, our analysis highlights the dynamical system approach as a natural and powerful framework to probe the thermodynamic aspects of cosmological evolution.",
Cross submissions,Unique gravitational wave signatures of GLPV scalar-tensor theories,"Guillem Domènech,Alexander Ganz,Mohammad Ali Gorji,Masahide Yamaguchi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study gravitational waves induced by scalar primordial fluctuations in Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV), beyond Horndeski, scalar-tensor theories. We uncover, at the level of the action, a new scalar-scalar-tensor interaction, unique to GLPV models disconnected from Horndeski via disformal transformation. The new interaction leads to third derivatives in the source for scalar-induced tensor modes, which are absent in Horndeski-related theories. Such new higher-derivative terms lead to a further enhanced production of induced gravitational waves. We predict that for a scale-invariant primordial spectrum, the induced gravitational wave spectral density has a characteristic frequency dependence proportional to $f^5$. Such a fast-rising spectrum offers a potential unique signature of modified gravity in the early universe.",
Cross submissions,Searching for a Dark Dimension Right-handed Neutrino in KATRIN,"Ignatios Antoniadis,Auttakit Chatrabhuti,Hiroshi Isono",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the possibility that the Right-handed neutrino is a five-dimensional state propagating along a micron size extra dimension, as required in the dark dimension proposal. We work out the signatures of R-neutrino production in KATRIN experiment and compare them with those of a sterile neutrino which manifests by a kink in the electron energy spectrum of the beta-decay at a value corresponding to the sterile neutrino mass. We explore the allowed parameter space of the compactification scale and the R-neutrino bulk mass versus the Yukawa coupling, and show that a large part of it is within KATRIN's sensitivity. When the bulk mass is much smaller than the compactification scale, several kinks could be observed corresponding to the positions of the R-neutrino Kaluza-Klein excitations, while for large bulk mass there will be effectively one kink at the position of the bulk mass.",
