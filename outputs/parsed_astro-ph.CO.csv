New submissions,"Systematic effect induced by misalignment in a Reflective Polarization Modulator for CMB, and application to the LiteBIRD case","S. Stellati,F. Piacentini,S. Micheli,A. Novelli,F. Columbro,A. Coppolecchia,P. de Bernardis,S. Masi,M. Najafi,A. Occhiuzzi,L. Pagano,A. Paiella,LiteBIRD Collaboration",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"[Abridged] The LiteBIRD mission aims to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization with unprecedented precision, targeting the detection of primordial B modes and a precise determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. A central component of LiteBIRD are the polarization modulators based on Half-Wave Plates (HWP). In this work, we investigate systematic effects caused by a small, constant misalignment between the reflective HWP's rotation axis and optical axis, which mimics a wedge-like effect. This effect can introduce HWP-synchronous pointing errors, biasing polarization measurements and generating spurious B modes. Using the LiteBIRD simulation framework, we implement this wedge-like misalignment in time-ordered data and evaluate its impact on reconstructed maps and angular power spectra. Our results show that the contamination predominantly mimics lensing B modes rather than primordial tensor modes, and its impact is reduced when increasing the number of detectors. By estimating the resulting error on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we set constraints on the maximum allowable wedge angle to ensure systematic effects remain below mission requirements. This study emphasizes the critical importance of precise optical alignment in CMB polarization experiments. Future work will address the additional effects of time-dependent HWP wobbling and more realistic scenarios with non-ideal detector pairs.",

Zuntz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present constraints on models of cosmology and astrophysics using cosmic shear data vectors from three datasets: the northern and southern Galactic cap of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) project, and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. These data vectors combined consist of 270 million galaxies spread across 13,000 ${\rm deg}^2$ of the sky. We first extract constraints for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find $S_8= 0.805^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.262^{+0.023}_{-0.036}$, which is consistent within $1.9 \sigma$ of constraints from the Planck satellite. Extending our analysis to dynamical dark energy models shows that lensing provides some (but still minor) improvements to existing constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations. Finally, we study six different models for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum. We show the different models provide consistent constraints on baryon suppression, and associated cosmology, once the astrophysical priors are sufficiently wide. Current scale-cut approaches for mitigating baryon contamination result in a residual bias of $\approx 0.3\sigma$ in the $S_8, \Omega_{\rm m}$ posterior. Using all scales with dedicated baryon modeling leads to negligible improvement as the new information is used solely to self-calibrate the baryon model on small scales. Additional non-lensing datasets, and/or calibrations of the baryon model, will be required to access the full statistical power of the lensing measurements. The combined dataset in this work represents the largest lensing dataset to date (most galaxies, largest area) and provides an apt testing ground for analyses of upcoming datasets from Stage IV surveys. The DECADE shear catalogs, data vectors, and likelihoods are made publicly available.",
New submissions,Tracing the Neutrino-Induced Phase Shift in the 21-cm Spectrum,"Gabriele Montefalcone,Hector Afonso G. Cruz,Julian B. Munoz,Ely D. Kovetz,Marc Kamionkowski",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the phase shift that free-streaming neutrinos imprint on the 21-cm power spectrum during cosmic dawn, computing for the first time its effect on both density- and velocity-induced acoustic oscillations. Neutrinos are known to generate a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations of the photon-baryon plasma before recombination, a signature already detected in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as well as the spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) extracted from galaxy surveys. We show that in the 21-cm signal this phase shift is distinct from that observed in the CMB and BAO spectra, exhibiting a characteristic mode and redshift dependence arising from the additional contribution of the so-called velocity acoustic oscillations (VAOs), sourced by the baryon-dark matter relative velocities. Our results establish the phase of acoustic oscillations in the 21-cm spectrum as a promising new avenue for probing free-streaming light relics at cosmic dawn, complementary to existing CMB and BAO measurements.",
New submissions,Spectral siren cosmology from gravitational-wave observations in GWTC-4.0,"Ignacio Magaña Hernandez,Antonella Palmese",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Gravitational wave standard sirens offer a promising avenue for cosmological inference, particularly in measuring the expansion history of the universe. Traditionally, bright sirens require an electromagnetic counterpart to determine the redshift of the emission source while dark sirens rely on the presence of complete galaxy catalogs over large sky regions. Spectral sirens, using GW data alone, can circumvent these limitations by leveraging features in the mass distribution of compact binaries. With the recent release of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4 (GWTC-4.0), the number of significant binary black hole (BBH) merger candidates has increased to 153, enabling more robust population studies and cosmological constraints. This work builds upon previous spectral siren analyses by analyzing the latest BBH observations with parametric and non-parametric models. In particular, we consider a parametric approach using the Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks models as well as a more flexible non-parametric model based on Gaussian processes. We find broad consistency in the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ constraints across models. Our most constraining result is from the Gaussian Process model, which, combined with the GW170817 bright siren measurement, results in $H_0 = 69^{+7}_{-6} \ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, a 10% precision measurement. For the Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks we find fractional uncertainties of 17% and 13% respectively.",
New submissions,Statistical Analysis of PAHs as a Tracer of Anomalous Microwave Emission Using DIRBE Data,"Danielle Sponseller,David T. Chuss,Brandon Hensley,Alan Kogut",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We use archival data from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) to map the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 3.3 $\mu$m emission feature and analyze its correlation with AME in 98 compact sources identified by the Planck collaboration. We find that while FIR thermal dust emission continues to be a better tracer of AME in most of the considered regions, 17% of the AME sources are better correlated with emission from small PAHs as traced by DIRBE. Furthermore, of the 27 sources which were identified as highly significant AME detections in the Planck analysis, 37% prefer PAHs as an AME tracer. Further work is required to understand to what extent local interstellar conditions are affecting PAH emission mechanisms and to reveal the underlying carriers of AME.",
New submissions,Nearly Full-Sky Low-Multipole CMB Temperature Anisotropy: I. Foreground Cleaned Maps,"Hayley C. Nofi,Graeme E. Addison,Charles L. Bennett,Laura Herold,J. L. Weiland",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Studies of cosmic microwave background (CMB) are often limited by foreground contamination. Foreground cleaning is performed either in harmonic or pixel space after data cuts have excluded sky areas of strong contamination. We present a nearly full-sky CMB temperature map with only 1% of pixels masked. To derive this map, we make use of six full-sky template maps at foreground-dominated frequencies from different experiments smoothed to $1^\circ$ and rely on the combination of these weighted maps to trace the morphology of foreground contamination. We do not impose any spectral index constraints, but only fit for template amplitudes at each target frequency. We clean WMAP and Planck maps at a set of target frequencies and conduct quality tests at the level of the maps, pixel histograms and power spectra to select four CMB maps that are cleaned with negligible foreground contamination and only 1% masked pixels and no inpainting. We recommend use of these cleaned CMB maps for low multipole ($\ell < 30$) studies.",
New submissions,Nearly Full-Sky Low-Multipole CMB Temperature Anisotropy: II. Angular Power Spectra and Likelihood,"Hayley C. Nofi,Graeme E. Addison,Charles L. Bennett,Laura Herold,J. L. Weiland",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a CMB temperature power spectrum measurement at large angular scales from WMAP and Planck maps that were cleaned of foregrounds using a template-based approach described in a companion paper. We recover essentially the full-sky CMB information at multipoles $\ell<30$ with only 1% of pixels near the Galactic plane masked and no inpainting. Notable features continue to appear: (a) a low quadrupole power compared to the best-fit Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM spectrum at $2.2\sigma$, (b) a dip in the range $20 \le \ell \le 27$, and (c) an overall $\ell<30$ power level low of the $\Lambda$CDM prediction derived from higher multipole moments. Given the different methodology from previous analyses and the nearly full-sky solution presented here, these features do not plausibly arise from foreground contamination, systematic errors, masking, or mode-mixing. Our overall $\ell<30$ amplitude constraint is consistent with published WMAP (77% sky fraction) and Planck (86%) results at $1.2\sigma$ and $0.6\sigma$, respectively, accounting for the improvement in statistical precision. We present a new $\ell<30$ likelihood for use with the Cobaya package. Parameter constraints from joint fits with the higher-multipole Planck data are consistent with the published Planck results, for example we find $H_0=67.35\pm0.54$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in a joint $\Lambda$CDM fit.",
New submissions,Nearly full-sky low-multipole CMB temperature anisotropy: III. CMB anomalies,"Laura Herold,Graeme E. Addison,Charles L. Bennett,Hayley C. Nofi,J. L. Weiland",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Unexpected features have been observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature on large scales. We revisit these CMB anomalies using new foreground-cleaned CMB temperature maps derived in a companion paper from WMAP and Planck data, which are tailored to low-resolution analysis and require only minimal masking of $1\%$ of the sky. These maps allow us to assess the impact of foreground-cleaning methods and the choice of sky cut on the significance of five commonly studied CMB anomalies. We find a notable impact of the choice of galactic mask on the significance of two anomalies: the significance of the low real-space correlation function and of the local-variance asymmetry reduces from $\sim3\sigma$ for the Planck common mask with $26\%$ masked fraction to $\sim2\sigma$ for the $1\%$ mask. We find good agreement between the two sky cuts for the low northern variance, $\sim3\sigma$, and the parity asymmetry, $\sim2\sigma$. For the quadrupole-octopole alignment, we find good agreement between the $1\%$-mask result and the full-sky results in the literature, $\sim3\sigma$. Thus using a larger fraction of the sky enabled by improved foreground cleaning reduces the significance of two commonly studied CMB anomalies. Overall, for an alternative physical model to be convincingly favored over $\Lambda$CDM with statistically-isotropic Gaussian fluctuations, it would need to explain multiple CMB anomalies, or better describe some other type of measurement in addition to a CMB anomaly.",

Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present the largest galaxy weak lensing mass map of the late-time Universe, reconstructed from 270 million galaxies in the DECADE and DES Year 3 datasets, covering 13,000 square degrees. We validate the map through systematic tests against observational conditions (depth, seeing, etc.), finding the map is statistically consistent with no contamination. The large area covered by the mass map makes it a well-suited tool for cosmological analyses, cross-correlation studies and the identification of large-scale structure features. We demonstrate its potential by detecting cosmic filaments directly from the mass map for the first time and validating them through their association with galaxy clusters selected using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect from Planck and ACT DR6.",
New submissions,Confirming lensed-quasar candidates with DESI and P200 spectroscopy I. 14 lensed quasars and 8 lensed galaxy,"Zizhao He,Qihang Chen,Shen Li,Nan Li,Xiaosheng Huang",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Lensed quasars are powerful probes of cosmology, the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, and the distribution of dark matter. We cross-match 1,724 previously identified candidates from HSC, KiDS, and the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS) with DESI DR1, obtaining 937 DESI spectra for 677 unique systems. Combining DESI spectroscopy with observations from the Palomar 200-inch Double Spectrograph (P200/DBSP), we confirm three lensed quasars with source redshifts of 1.71, 1.93, and 3.23 and Einstein radii of 0.96, 0.39, and 1.07 arcsec, respectively. We further identify 11 high-confidence candidates that are well reproduced by a simple singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, exhibit lens galaxies in the image modeling, and have at least one available spectrum; across these, the Einstein radius spans 0.39 to 2.34 arcsec and the source redshift spans 1.13 to 2.88. In 8 of the 11 cases, the systems already satisfy our lensing criteria except that only one quasar image currently has a spectrum; obtaining a second spectrum for the other image would enable immediate confirmation. As by-products, we report eight new lensed galaxies spanning galaxy- to group-scale lenses. These results provide valuable targets for follow-up studies and underscore the efficiency of wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as DESI in confirming gravitationally lensed quasars and galaxies.",
New submissions,A large thermal energy reservoir in the nascent intracluster medium at a redshift of 4.3,"Dazhi Zhou,Scott Chapman,Manuel Aravena,Pablo Araya-Araya,Melanie Archipley,Jared Cathey,Roger Deane,Luca Di Mascolo,Raphael Gobat,Thomas Greve,Ryley Hill,Seonwoo Kim,Kedar Phadke,Vismaya Pillai,Ana Posses,Christian Reichardt,Manuel Solimano,Justin Spilker,Nikolaus Sulzenauer,Veronica Dike,Joaquin Vieira,David Vizgan,George Wang,Axel Weiss",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Most baryons in present-day galaxy clusters exist as hot gas ($\boldsymbol{\gtrsim10^7\,\rm}\mathrm{K}$), forming the intracluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that the mass and temperature of the ICM rapidly decrease with increasing cosmological redshift, as intracluster gas in younger clusters is still accumulating and being heated. The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arises when cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are scattered to higher energies through interactions with energetic electrons in hot ICM, leaving a localized decrement in the CMB at a long wavelength. The depth of this decrement is a measure of the thermal energy and pressure of the gas. To date, the effect has been detected in only three systems at or above $z\sim2$, when the Universe was 4 billion years old, making the time and mechanism of ICM assembly uncertain. Here, we report observations of this effect in the protocluster SPT2349$-$56 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SPT2349$-$56 contains a large molecular gas reservoir, with at least 30 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and three radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a 100-kpc region at $z=4.3$, corresponding to 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang. The observed tSZ signal implies a thermal energy of $\mathbf{\sim 10^{61}\,\mathrm{erg}}$, exceeding the possible energy of a virialized ICM by an order of magnitude. Contrary to current theoretical expectations, the strong tSZ decrement in SPT2349$-$56 demonstrates that substantial heating can occur and deposit a large amount of thermal energy within growing galaxy clusters, overheating the nascent ICM in unrelaxed structures, two billion years before the first mature clusters emerged at $\mathbf{z \sim 2}$.",
New submissions,Primordial black holes versus their impersonators at gravitational wave observatories,"Andrea Begnoni,Stefano Profumo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The detection of primordial black holes (PBHs) would mark a major breakthrough, with far-reaching implications for early universe cosmology, fundamental physics, and the nature of dark matter. Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\geq 3\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \lesssim 2 M_\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.2$.",

Wold",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is conducting a wide-field survey of the northern sky in three optical bands and the collaboration cosmology working group has released 3628 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during its first 2.5 years of operation. This ""ZTF SN Ia DR2"" sample is the largest SN Ia dataset to date.Fully exploiting this dataset to improve understanding of the properties of dark energy requires a photometric accuracy of O(0.1%). This can be achieved using Scene Modeling Photometry (SMP), which is optimal to extract a transient signal (SN) from a complex background (its host), while ensuring a common flux estimator with nearby stars used as calibration reference. In this paper, we present the status of the SMP development and use it to assess the precision and accuracy of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 force photometry light curves.We reach a repeatability of the star observations better than 1%. However, we have identified a new sensor effect, dubbed ""pocket-effect"", which distorts the Point Spread Function (PSF) in a flux-dependent manner leading to non-linearities in the photometry of a few percent. Correcting for this effect requires time- and sensor-dependent corrections to be applied at the pixel level, which is currently under development. This effects affects all light curve releases to date -- both from forced photometry and scene modelling preventing ZTF SN Ia DR2 to be used for accurate cosmological inference.Comparing the SMP and forced photometry measurements, we find that stretch and color estimated from both processings are consistent, aside from a 10 mmag shift in color. This assess the robustness of results presented as part of the the ZTF SN Ia DR2 release. The absolute calibration however shifts by 90 mmag. A reprocessing of the full ZTF SN Ia DR2 dataset using the SMP method is currently in progress.",
New submissions,Renormalization-Free Galaxy Bias in Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory,Naonori Sugiyama,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a renormalization-free framework for modeling galaxy bias based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). In this approach, the biased density fluctuation is built solely from Galileon-type operators associated with the intrinsic nonlinear growth of dark matter. This ensures the bias expansion is well defined at the field level, automatically satisfies statistical conditions of vanishing ensemble and volume averages, and removes the need for ad hoc renormalization. We derive analytic one-loop expressions for the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra and implement an efficient numerical algorithm using \texttt{FFTLog} and \texttt{FAST-PT}, enabling rapid and accurate evaluation. The model requires only a minimal set of bias parameters: three parameters are sufficient to describe correlation functions in configuration space, while four parameters are needed for power spectra in Fourier space. To test accuracy, we jointly fit halo auto- and cross-spectra from the \textit{Dark Emulator}, covering nine redshift-mass combinations with 100 cosmologies each. A single set of bias parameters reproduces both spectra within $\sim1\%$ up to $k \simeq 0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for typical linear bias $b_1 \sim 0.8$-2, and to $k \simeq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $b_1 \sim 3$. The same parameters also match two-point correlation functions down to $r \simeq 15\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. Moreover, ULPT predicts the relation $b_{K^2}^{\mathrm{E}} = -\tfrac{3}{4} b_2^{\mathrm{E}}$, validated against $N$-body results. These results demonstrate that ULPT provides a physically consistent and efficient model for nonlinear galaxy bias, with applications to redshift-space distortions, bispectra, and reconstruction. The numerical implementation is released as the open-source Python packagethis https URL.",
New submissions,Bright siren without electromagnetic counterpart by LISA-Taiji-TianQin network,"Yejing Zhan,David Izquierdo-Villalba,Xiao Guo,Qing Yang,Daniele Spinoso,Fa-Yin Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Gravitational waves (GWs) with electromagnetic counterparts (EMc) offer a novel approach to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens, enabling $H_0$ measurements by combining GW-derived distances with EM-derived redshifts. Host galaxy identification is essential for redshift determination but remains challenging due to poor GW sky localization and uncertainties in EMc models. To overcome these limitations, we exploit the ultra-high-precision localization ($\Delta \Omega_s \sim 10^{-4} \, \text{deg}^2$) with a space-based GW detector network (LISA-Taiji-TianQin), which permits unique host identification solely from GW signals. We integrate five massive black hole binary (MBHB) population models and two galaxy number density models to compute the redshift horizon for host galaxy identification and evaluate $H_0$ constraints. We find that (1) The network enhances localization by several orders of magnitude compared to single detectors; (2) The identification horizon reaches $z\sim 1.2$ for specific MBHBs in the most accurate localization case; (3) The population model choice critically impacts the outcomes: the most refined population models yield to independent EMc identification rate of 0.6-1 $\text{yr}^{-1}$ with $H_0$ constraints $< 1\%$ fractional uncertainty, the less refined models lead to the rate $<0.1\text{yr}^{-1}$ and $1-2\%$ uncertainty on $H_0$.",
New submissions,Cosmography via stellar archaeology of low-redshift early-type galaxies from SDSS,"Carlos A. Álvarez,Marcos M. Cueli,Alessandro Bressan,Lumen Boco,Balakrishna S. Haridasu,Michele Bosi,Luigi Danese,Andrea Lapi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Cosmic chronometers offer a model-independent way to trace the expansion history of the Universe via the dating of passively evolving objects. This enables testing the validity of cosmological models without concrete assumptions of their energy content. The main goal of this work is to derive model-independent constraints on the Hubble parameter up to $z \sim 0.4$ using stellar ages from the fitting of Lick index absorption lines in passively evolving galaxies. Contrary to recent related works that rely on finite differences to obtain a discrete measurement of the expansion of the Universe at an average redshift, our goal is to perform a cosmographic fit of $H(z)$ in terms of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk ($j_0$) parameters. We carefully select spectra of massive and passively evolving galaxies from the SDSS Legacy Survey. After applying a stacking procedure to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio, the strength of Lick indices is fit using two stellar population models (TMJ and Knowles) to derive stellar population parameters. A cosmographic fit to the stellar ages is performed, which in turn enables the sampling of the Hubble parameter within the considered redshift range. The baseline result comes from using the TMJ-modelled ages, and it yields a value of $H_0 = 70.0^{+4.1}_{-7.6} \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$ for the Hubble constant, where uncertainties refer only to the statistical treatment of the data. The sampling of the Hubble parameter at $0.05 < z < 0.35$ is competitive with discreet model-independent measurements from the literature. We finally draw attention to an unexpected oscillating pattern in a number of critical indices with respect to redshift, which translates into a similar behaviour in the $t-z$ relations. These features have never been discussed before, although they are present in previous measurements.",
New submissions,Axion-Photon Conversion In Magnetized Universe: Impact On The Global 21-cm Signal,"Pravin Kumar Natwariya,Vivekanand Mohapatra,Hriditi Howlader",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The reported anomalous global 21-cm signal $(T_{21})$ from the cosmic dawn era by Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionisation Signature (EDGES) could hint towards new physics beyond the standard model. The resonant conversion of the axion-like particles (ALPs) into photons in the presence of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) could be a viable solution. However, the strength of the PMFs can change over the time as they can decay by ambipolar diffusion and turbulent decay. Consequently, PMFs can dissipate their energy into the intergalactic medium (IGM), which can alter the global 21-cm signal. We simultaneously consider both magnetic heating of IGM and resonant conversion of ALPs to derive physically motivated upper bounds on the coupling strength $(g_{a\gamma})$ and magnetic field strength $(B_n)$. Our findings report that, for $B_n= 0.1\,\rm nG$, $g_{a\gamma}B_n\lesssim (3.6\times 10^{-4}-3\times 10^{-3})$ is required to recover standard $T_{21}=-156\,\rm mK$, while a deeper absorption of $-500$ mK pushes the upper bound to $g_{a\gamma}B_n\lesssim (6.5\times 10^{-4}-5.7\times 10^{-3})$.",
New submissions,Fractal Properties of the Cosmic Web,Jaan Einasto,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The cosmic web is one of the most complex systems in nature, consisting of galaxies and clusters of galaxies joined by filaments and walls, leaving large empty regions called cosmic voids. The most common method of describing the web is a correlation function and its derivative, the fractal function. In this paper, I provide a review of the fractal properties of the cosmic web from the observational point of view within the Newtonian concordance $\Lambda$CDM Universe framework. I give a brief history of fractal studies of the Universe. I then describe the derivation of the fractal function from angular and spatial distributions of galaxies and their relations. Correlation functions are not sensitive to the shape of the galaxy distribution. To improve our quantitative understanding of properties of the web, statistics must be used which are sensitive to the pattern of the web.",
New submissions,GWTC-4.0: Constraints on the Cosmic Expansion Rate and Modified Gravitational-wave Propagation,"TheLIGO Scientific Collaboration, theVirgo Collaboration, theKAGRA Collaboration",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze data from 142 of the 218 gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) to estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ jointly with the population properties of merging compact binaries. We measure the luminosity distance and redshifted masses of GW sources directly; in contrast, we infer GW source redshifts statistically through i) location of features in the compact object mass spectrum and merger rate evolution, and ii) identifying potential host galaxies in the GW localization volume. Probing the relationship between source luminosity distances and redshifts obtained in this way yields constraints on cosmological parameters. We also constrain parameterized deviations from general relativity which affect GW propagation, specifically those modifying the dependence of a GW signal on the source luminosity distance. Assuming our fiducial model for the source-frame mass distribution and using GW candidates detected up to the end of the fourth observing run (O4a), together with the GLADE+ all-sky galaxy catalog, we estimate $H_0 = 76.6^{+13.0}_{-9.5} (76.6^{+25.2}_{-14.0})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is reported as a median with 68.3% (90%) symmetric credible interval, and includes combination with the $H_0$ measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. Using a parametrization of modified GW propagation in terms of the magnitude parameter $\Xi_0$, we estimate $\Xi_0 = 1.2^{+0.8}_{-0.4} (1.2^{+2.4}_{-0.5})$, where $\Xi_0 = 1$ recovers the behavior of general relativity.",
New submissions,Generation of Lognormal Synthetic Lyman-$α$ Forest Spectra for $P_{1D}$ Analysis,"Meagan Herbold,Naim Göksel Karaçaylı,Paul Martini",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The one-dimensional flux power spectrum (P1D) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest probes small-scale structure in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is therefore sensitive to a variety of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. These include the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal history of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale fluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly sensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate synthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these effects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for generating one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D analysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted flux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation parameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \leq z \leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \leq k \leq 1.0$ s km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to sub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we discuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of astrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects. Such improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and enable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D inference and precision cosmology.",
Cross submissions,Hawking tunneling radiation with thermodynamic pressure,"Cheng Hu,Xiao-Xiong Zeng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Hawking radiation elucidates black holes as quantum thermodynamic systems, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between general relativity and quantum mechanics through particle emission phenomena. While conventional theoretical frameworks predominantly focus on classical spacetime configurations, recent advancements in Extended Phase Space thermodynamics have redefined cosmological parameters (such as the $\Lambda$-term) as dynamic variables. Notably, the thermodynamics of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes has been successfully extended to incorporate thermodynamic pressure $P$. Within this extended phase space framework, although numerous intriguing physical phenomena have been identified, the tunneling mechanism of particles incorporating pressure and volume remains unexplored. This study investigates Hawking radiation through particle tunneling in Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes within the extended phase space, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ is introduced via a dynamic cosmological constant $\Lambda$. By employing semi-classical tunneling calculations with self-gravitation corrections, we demonstrate that emission probabilities exhibit a direct correlation with variations in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Significantly, the radiation spectrum deviates from pure thermality, aligning with unitary quantum evolution while maintaining consistency with standard phase space results. Moreover, through thermodynamic analysis, we have verified that the emission rate of particles is related to the difference in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the emitted particles before and after they tunnel through the potential barrier. These findings establish particle tunneling as a unified probe of quantum gravitational effects in black hole thermodynamics.",
Cross submissions,Towards a Heterotic Axiverse,"Jacob M. Leedom,Margherita Putti,Alexander Westphal",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this paper we initiate a broad study of some central properties of the string axiverse arising from Calabi-Yau compactifications of the perturbative heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ theory. Along this road toward a heterotic axiverse, we characterize the generic structure of the axion mass spectrum and the effective couplings of the non-QCD heterotic axions to Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields and discuss their implications for cosmology, particle phenomenology, and the QCD axion quality problem. We also provide arguments that the heterotic axion masses are bounded from below much more strongly than, for example, the spectrum in type IIB compactifications.",
Cross submissions,Testing Seesaw and Leptogenesis via Gravitational Waves: Majorana versus Dirac,"Anish Ghoshal,Kazunori Kohri,Nimmala Narendra",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the B-L gauge extension of the Standard Model that the Dirac seesaw mechanism with thermal Leptogenesis can be tested using the stochastic gravitational background (SGWB) emanating from a network of cosmic strings when B-L symmetry is broken. With right-handed neutrino mass lighter than the typical scale of grand unification, the B-L symmetry protecting the right-handed neutrinos leads to constraints on the Yukawa couplings for both Dirac and Majorana scenarios. Estimating the predicted gravitational wave background we find that future space-borne missions could probe the range concerning thermal Dirac Leptogenesis. In a comparative analysis between such probes of gravitational wave sourced from cosmic strings in Dirac and Majorana Leptogenesis in the B-L extension, based on the energy scales of the Leptogenesis, for instance, GW detectors will be able to probe the scale of Dirac Leptogenesis upto $ 10^{9}$ GeV, while for Majorana Leptogenesis it would be upto $ 10^{12}$ GeV.",
Cross submissions,Unveiling horizons in quantum critical collapse,"Marija Tomašević,Chih-Hung Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Critical gravitational collapse offers a unique window into regimes of arbitrarily high curvature, culminating in a naked singularity arising from smooth initial data -- thus providing a dynamical counterexample to weak cosmic censorship. Near the critical regime, quantum effects from the collapsing matter are expected to intervene before full quantum gravity resolves the singularity. Despite its fundamental significance, a self-consistent treatment has so far remained elusive. In this work, we perform a one-loop semiclassical analysis using the robust anomaly-based method in the canonical setup of Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a free, massless scalar field. Focusing on explicitly solvable critical solutions in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, we analytically solve the semiclassical Einstein equations and provide definitive answers to several long-standing questions. We find that regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like quantum state, encoding genuine vacuum polarization effects from the collapsing matter. Remarkably, the resulting quantum corrections manifest as a growing mode. Horizon-tracing analyses, incorporating both classical and quantum modes, reveal the emergence of a finite mass gap, signaling a phase transition from classical Type II to quantum-modified Type I behavior, thereby providing a quantum enforcement of the weak cosmic censorship. The most nontrivial aspect of our analysis involves dealing with non-conformal matter fields in explicitly time-dependent critical spacetimes. Along the way, we uncover intriguing and previously underexplored features of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.",
Cross submissions,Quantum Critical Collapse Abhors a Naked Singularity,"Marija Tomašević,Chih-Hung Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Classical critical collapse yields naked singularities from smooth initial data, challenging cosmic censorship and shaping the spectrum of primordial black holes. We show that one-loop vacuum polarization near the threshold alters this outcome. In analytically tractable Einstein-scalar critical spacetimes, regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like state whose stress tensor supplies a universal quantum growing mode. Its backreaction competes with the classical unstable mode, producing a shift of the critical point and a finite mass gap at the new threshold, thereby enforcing horizon formation even under arbitrary fine-tuning. In primordial collapse, the threshold shift enters exponentially into the formation fraction, while the gap truncates the low-mass tail -- effects that may reshape the predicted mass spectrum. These results provide the first consistent quantum treatment of critical collapse, offering definitive predictions for several long-standing problems.",
Cross submissions,Search for low-mass electron-recoil dark matter using a single-charge sensitive SuperCDMS-HVeV Detector,SuperCDMS Collaboration,High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"We present constraints on low mass dark matter-electron scattering and absorption interactions using a SuperCDMS high-voltage eV-resolution (HVeV) detector. Data were taken underground in the NEXUS facility located at Fermilab with an overburden of 225 meters of water equivalent. The experiment benefits from the minimizing of luminescence from the printed circuit boards in the detector holder used in all previous HVeV studies. A blind analysis of $6.1\,\mathrm{g\cdot days}$ of exposure produces exclusion limits for dark matter-electron scattering cross-sections for masses as low as $1\,\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$, as well as on the photon-dark photon mixing parameter and the coupling constant between axion-like particles and electrons for particles with masses $>1.2\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ probed via absorption processes.",
Cross submissions,Light nuclei under magnetic field and the lithium problem,Nodoka Yamanaka,Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex),"We analyze the effect of the magnetic field on the proton and neutron density distributions of the nuclei 2H, 3H, 3He, which are calculated ab initio, and the 6Li nucleus in the alpha-cluster model. It is found that the asymptotic exponential damp of the probability density at long distance is modified, and that the linear component of the exponent with respect to the magnetic field yields the leading contribution, while those of the second derivative and the confining magnetic force are subleading. Due to the linear dependence of the exponent, fluctuating magnetic fields always enhance the tunneling rate, i.e. the cross section of low energy nuclear reactions which occur at large separation across the Coulomb barrier. While this mechanism cannot suppress the production of 7Be in the early Universe, it has the potential to resolve the lithium problem either by increasing the reaction rate of 7Be + p -> 8B at the bigbang nucleosynthesis era if the magnetic field at this time was sufficiently strong, or by correcting the systematically enlarged 4He + 3He -> 7Be cross section by the unwanted magnetic field generated in the nuclear experimental setup, which was so far used as the input of the simulation of bigbang nucleosynthesis.",
