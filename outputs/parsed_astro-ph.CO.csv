New submissions,Differentiable Halo Mass Prediction and the Cosmology-Dependence of Halo Mass Functions,"Jim Buisman,Florian List,Oliver Hahn",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Modern cosmological inference increasingly relies on differentiable models to enable efficient, gradient-based parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Here, we present a novel approach for predicting the abundance of dark matter haloes and their cosmology dependence using a differentiable, field-level neural network (NN) model, and study how well the cosmology dependence is captured by common parametrisations of the halo mass function (HMF), and by our NN-based approach. By training a 3D U-Net on initial density fields from fast N-body simulations with varying cosmological parameters, we enable direct, differentiable mapping from the linear density field to protohalo patches and their mass bins. Our method achieves competitive accuracy in identifying protohalo regions and in capturing the dependence of the HMF on cosmological parameters. Our NN derivatives agree well with finite differences of both analytical and emulated HMFs, at the level of the disagreement among the different models. We further demonstrate how the NN model can additionally be used to investigate the response of the HMF to changes in the initial Gaussian random field. Finally, we also demonstrate that a differentiable model can be used to extrapolate existing models at very high precision.",
New submissions,On the ages of the stellar populations of galaxies at $z=0.1$-7,Eric E. Martínez-García,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent studies have reported a non evolution of galaxy ages at redshifts higher than $z\sim$ 2.5, as well as galaxies older than the Universe. In this work, a sample of galaxies from JWST and HST was analysed via photometry to further understand this astronomical phenomenon. No prior cosmological parameters were assumed in the analysis, but the spectroscopic redshift. When compared to stellar population synthesis models, the results for mass-weighted galaxy ages indicate that the analysed objects seem to be divided into two subsets. The results for the subset with the majority of objects (60\% assuming a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology) indicate an evolution of galaxy ages within the redshift range $z$=0.1-7.0, in the sense that higher redshift galaxies are younger than the Universe. Sources of systematic errors were discussed drawing into conclusion that degeneracies between reddening-age-metallicity, and/or AGN emission may explain the rest 40\% of the galaxies with ages older than expected from a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology.",
New submissions,Mitigating Model Misspecification in Simulation-Based Inference for Galaxy Clustering,"Sébastien Pierre,Bruno Régaldo-Saint Blancard,ChangHoon Hahn,Michael Eickenberg",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Simulation-based inference (SBI) has become an important tool in cosmology for extracting additional information from observational data using simulations. However, all cosmological simulations are approximations of the actual universe, and SBI methods can be sensitive to model misspecification - particularly when the observational data lie outside the support of the training distribution. We present a method to improve the robustness of cosmological analyses under such conditions. Our approach first identifies and discards components of the summary statistics that exhibit inconsistency across related simulators, then learns a transformation that brings the observation back within the support of the training distribution. We apply our method in the context of a recent SimBIG SBI galaxy clustering analysis using the wavelet scattering transform (WST) summary statistic. The original analysis struggled to produce robust constraints for certain subsets of WST coefficients, where the observational data appeared out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the training data. We show that our method enables robust cosmological inference and resolves OOD issues, while preserving most of the constraining power. In particular, the improved SimBIG WST analysis yields $\Lambda$CDM constraints of $\Omega_m = 0.32^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.80^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, which are respectively $1.4\times$ and $3.1\times$ tighter than those from a standard perturbation-theory-based power spectrum analysis, confirming the significant information gain of WST summary statistics. The proposed method is easily applicable to other cosmological SBI contexts and represents a step toward more robust SBI pipelines.",
New submissions,Towards a unified scheme of blazar evolution,"E. Oukacha,Y. Becherini",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly used across astrophysics, enabled by the growing availability of data and improved acquisition methods. These approaches now support tasks from redshift estimation to source classification. In this work, we aim to (i) classify blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR3 catalogue, in particular to identify the likely origin of blazars of uncertain type (BCUs), and (ii) investigate the full blazar sample to study their structure and redshift-luminosity evolution. We focus especially on the transition region between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which may yield insights into accretion disk evolution. We examine Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) as potential intermediates in this transition. We implement a classification pipeline using both a strong benchmark model (XGBoost) and a foundation model pre-trained on millions of tabular datasets (TabPFN). By extracting and reducing the high-dimensional latent space of the best model, we provide a 2D representation of the blazar population. This reveals a continuum between FSRQs and BL Lacs, including CLBs as transitional sources. These results support a scenario of gradual evolution from radiatively efficient (FSRQ-like) to inefficient (BL Lac-like) accretion. Ultimately, we show that a single probability score, combined with the latent space, offers a new framework for interpreting blazar diversity beyond discrete classes.",
New submissions,Evolving Dark Sector and the Dark Dimension Scenario,"Alek Bedroya,Georges Obied,Cumrun Vafa,David H. Wu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the KK graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w<-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. Regardless of the SN dataset, there is a preference for non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$ that are in the expected $O(1)$ range in Planck units as suggested by the Swampland criteria. In particular, there is a remarkable consistency with $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ for all dataset combinations including SN, and close to the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.",
New submissions,Constraints on Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes from Planck 2018 and Other Cosmological Probes,Shintaro K. Hayashi,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Cosmologically coupled black holes (CCBHs) are alternative black hole models whose masses evolve as $M \propto a^3$ on cosmological scales. This characteristic suggests that CCBHs could contribute to the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this paper, I consider a CCBH model in which the cosmological constant is effectively induced, while the baryonic mass is conserved within conventional black holes. This model is motivated by the theoretical framework of Schwarzschild - de Sitter black holes. Assuming that the accelerated cosmic expansion is caused by CCBHs, I perform a cosmological parameter estimation using datasets including Planck 2018 CMB, CMB lensing, BAO, and supernovae. The analysis reveals notable shifts in cosmological parameters, such as $H_0 = 72.24^{+0.34}_{-0.35} \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, compared to the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$. My $H_0$ constraint is consistent with the value $H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ reported by SH0ES within $1 \sigma$. However, the overall fit to the data worsens, with a total $\chi^2 = 2884.12$ for the CCBH model, compared to $\chi^2 = 2836.12$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. I show that the effect of cosmological coupling is suppressed by a factor of $10^{-16}$ at $\sim$pc scales, rendering it negligible compared to the standard black hole mass in local astrophysical phenomena, although the CCBH model can explain the accelerated expansion.",
New submissions,SKYSURF IX -- The Cosmic Optical and Infrared Background from Integrated Galaxy Light Measurements,"Scott A. Tompkins,Simon P. Driver,Aaron S. G. Robotham,Rogier A. Windhorst,Delondrae Carter,Timothy Carleton,Zak Goisman,Daniel Henningsen,Luke J. Davies,Sabine Bellstedt,Jordan C. J. D'Silva,Juno Li,Seth H. Cohen,Rolf A. Jansen,Rosalia O'Brien,Anton M. Koekemoer,Norman Grogin,John MacKenty",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"As part of the SKYSURF Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Legacy Archival program we present galaxy number counts which yield measurements of the extragalactic background light (EBL) at 15 different wavelengths. We have processed 82,752 HST images across 23 filters into 16,686 mosaics using the same software and processing pipeline throughout. Using 17/23 filters that give reliable galaxy counts, we constrain the integrated galaxy light (IGL) with a 1.5-9\% error between 0.3 and 1.6 $\mu$m in combination with 8 bands from WAVES (Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey) and DEVILS (Deep Extragalactic Visible Legacy Survey). While HST was never intended to undertake large area surveys, through extensive quality control and filtering, we were able to extract a reliable and representative sample of fields distributed across the sky. Our final catalogs cover a combined $\approx 19.6 °^2$, with individual filters covering areas ranging from $\approx 0.16-7.0 °^2$. The combination of numerous independent sight-lines and area coverage allows us to reduce cosmic variance uncertainties in deep number counts to 0.06\%-1.8\%. For the first time we are able to establish a measurement of the IGL, $\mathrm{9.07 \pm 0.35 nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$, at 0.59 $\mu$m using HST data. We obtain a cosmic optical background value of $ 24.45 \pm 0.50 \mathrm{nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$. Different techniques used to measure the COB, both directly and indirectly, have recently converged indicating that the COB arises almost exclusively from processes within galaxies. This in combination with the recent values reported from New Horizons and very high energy (VHE) constraints leaves very little room for any diffuse emission coming from outside the Milky Way.",
New submissions,Post-inflationary enhancement of adiabatic perturbations in modular cosmology,"Rodrigo Gonzalez Quaglia,Martino Michelotti,Diederik Roest,John Joseph Carrasco,Renata Kallosh,Andrei Linde",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We show that multi-field inflationary models with negligible turning in field space during inflation can lead to an effective sourcing of adiabatic from entropic perturbations {\it after} the end of inflation. We illustrate this general phenomenon with a detailed analysis of an inflationary model whose scalar potential is determined by modular invariance. Its entropic perturbations are frozen during inflation, but instead, they are converted into adiabatic perturbations in the first post-inflationary $e$-folds. The curvature power spectrum, giving rise to CMB fluctuations, reaches a novel and enhanced plateau in this process; we address the implications for the inflationary observables $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.",
New submissions,J-PAS: Forecasting constraints on Neutrino Masses,"Gabriel Rodrigues,Antonio J. Cuesta,Jailson Alcaniz,Miguel Aparicio Resco,Antonio L. Maroto,Manuel Masip,Jamerson G.

In this work, we present a forecast based on the Fisher matrix method to establish its sensitivity to the sum of the neutrino masses. We adapt the Fisher Galaxy Survey Code (FARO) to account for the neutrino mass under various configurations applied to galaxy clustering measurements. This approach allows us to test the sensitivity of J-PAS to the neutrino mass across different tracers, with and without non-linear corrections, and under varying sky coverage. We perform our forecast for two cosmological models: $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ and $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$. We combine our J-PAS forecast with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck Collaboration and Type Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon Plus. Our analysis shows that, for a sky coverage of 8,500 square degrees, J-PAS galaxy clustering data alone will constrain the sum of the neutrino masses to an upper limit of $\sum m_\nu < 0.32$\;eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and $\sum m_\nu < 0.36$\;eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. When combined with Planck data, the upper limit improves significantly. For J-PAS+Planck, we find $\sum m_\nu < 0.061$\;eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and for J-PAS+Planck+Pantheon Plus, we obtain $\sum m_\nu < 0.12$\;eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. These results demonstrate that J-PAS clustering measurements can play a crucial role in addressing challenges in the neutrino sector, including potential tensions between cosmological and terrestrial measurements of the neutrino mass, as well as in determining the mass ordering.",
New submissions,Bimetric gravity improves the fit to DESI BAO and eases the Hubble tension,"Marcus Högås,Edvard Mörtsell",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB + SNe Ia, but it exacerbates the Hubble tension. By comparison, bimetric gravity provides a modest improvement in fit quality, at the $1 \, \sigma$ level, but, by inferring $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.4 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, it partially eases the Hubble tension, from a $5 \,\sigma$ discrepancy to a $3.7 \, \sigma$ tension. Including locally calibrated SNe Ia brings the overall preference for the bimetric model over $\Lambda$CDM to the $2 \, \sigma$ level, comparable to that of the $w_0 w_a$CDM model when including the local SN Ia calibration.",
New submissions,Shot noise in clustering power spectra,"Nicolas Tessore,Alex Hall",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We show that the `shot noise' bias in angular clustering power spectra observed from discrete samples of points is not noise, but rather a known additive contribution that naturally arises due to degenerate pairs of points. In particular, we show that the true shot noise contribution cannot have a `non-Poissonian' value, even though all point processes with non-trivial two-point statistics are non-Poissonian. Apparent deviations from the `Poissonian' value can arise when significant correlations or anti-correlations are localised on small spatial scales. However, such deviations always correspond to a physical difference in two-point statistics, not a difference in noise. In the context of simulations, if clustering is treated as the tracer of a discretised underlying density field, any sub- or super-Poissonian sampling of the tracer induces such small-scale modifications and vice versa; we show this explicitly using recent innovations in angular power spectrum estimation from discrete catalogues. Finally, we show that the full covariance of clustering power spectra can also be computed explicitly: it depends only on the two-, three- and four-point statistics of the point process. The usual Gaussian covariance approximation appears as one term in the shot noise contribution, which is non-diagonal even for Gaussian random fields and Poisson sampling.",
New submissions,"A halo model of extragalactic contamination to CMB lensing, delensing, and cross-correlations","A. Baleato Lizancos,W. Coulton,A. Challinor,B. D. Sherwin,Y. Mehta",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"CMB lensing reconstructions are a sensitive probe of the growth of structure across cosmic time and a key tool to sharpen investigations of the very early Universe via delensing. At present, a large fraction of this information is drawn from the temperature anisotropies, which are ultimately also the most informative when reconstructing lenses on arcminute scales and smaller. But extragalactic foreground emission from galaxies and clusters can contaminate these reconstructions, limiting our ability to use information from small-scale temperature anisotropies. We develop analytic predictions of the biases from the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich and cosmic infrared background to CMB lensing auto- and cross-correlations with low-redshift matter tracers, as well as B-mode delensing, based on a halo model for the dominant one- and two-halo contributions to the relevant foreground bi- and tri-spectra. The method is flexible enough to allow variations in cosmology, astrophysical modeling, experimental configurations and analysis choices, thus enabling an improved understanding of the uncertainties involved in current mitigation strategies. We find that the shape of the bias relative to the CMB lensing auto-spectrum signal is remarkably insensitive to changes in cosmological and astrophysical parameter values. On the other hand, the shape appears to depend on $\Omega_m$ for cross-correlations with low-redshift galaxies. We also clarify the ranges of redshifts and masses that simulations need to resolve in order to capture these effects accurately. Our code, CosmoBLENDER, is made publicly available.",
New submissions,Search for spatial coincidences between galaxy mergers and Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 sources,"Siddhant Manna,Shantanu Desai",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present a systematic search for spatial association between a high-confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers detected through SDSS imaging and the 4FGL-DR4 catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using a conservative 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson-based statistical framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match probabilities $p < 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters such as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger-driven processes can fuel high-energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of AGN-like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy mergers, opening new avenues for understanding the role of interactions in high-energy astrophysics. We additionally examined the sample of 70 galaxy pairs from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and found no statistically significant matches, with $p < 0.05$ within the 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold.",
New submissions,"Torsion cosmology in the light of DESI, supernovae and CMB observational constraints","Tonghua Liu,Xiaolei Li,Tengpeng Xu,Marek Biesiada,Jieci Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a torsion-based cosmological model within the Einstein-Cartan framework, analyze it using combined DESI, PantheonPlus/DESY5, and CMB datasets, a reveals several interesting features. The torsion parameter $\alpha$ shows a trend of change from $\alpha=0.042^{+0.035}_{-0.031}$ (CMB alone) to $\alpha=-0.0075\pm0.0058$ (full dataset), while remaining consistent with zero within $1.7\sigma$. The model demonstrates potential in addressing cosmological tensions, yielding $H_0 = 68.80\pm0.48~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ and reducing the $S_8$ tension from $0.73\sigma$ to $0.1\sigma$ through its torsion-modified growth equation. Bayesian evidence analysis shows a clear preference for torsion cosmology in most dataset combinations, with the notable exception of CMB+DESI+DESY5 which slightly favors $\Lambda$CDM. Remarkably, substituting DESY5 with PantheonPlus data reverses this preference, yielding $\Delta\log\mathcal{Z} = -3.59$ - a strong indication of the model's viability. While not conclusive, these findings suggest torsion cosmology merits further investigation as a potential extension to $\Lambda$CDM.",
New submissions,Deciphering Baryonic Feedback from ACT tSZ Galaxy Clusters,"Nihar Dalal,Chun-Hao To,Chris Hirata,Tae Hyeon-Shin,Matt Hilton,Shivam Pandey,J. Richard Bond",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The next generation of cosmology surveys will probe the matter distribution of the universe to unparalleled precision. To match this level of precision in cosmological parameter estimation, we need to use information at small scales of $\sim$ 1 Mpc, which requires an accurate model of baryonic feedback. In this paper, we employ the Dark Matter + Baryon (DMB) model, a flexible halo model that is well-fit to various hydrodynamical simulations, to extract information on baryonic feedback from galaxy cluster observables. Using a sample of thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) selected galaxy clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) - with masses calibrated via weak lensing from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) - we develop a robust end-to-end pipeline that directly models the calibrated observables. Our analysis demonstrates that the tSZ Y-M relation can constrain several DMB model parameters, providing key insights into baryonic feedback effects on cosmic shear at the several percent level. We find a preference for intermediate to strong levels of feedback, which is both consistent with several hydrodynamic simulations and competitive with similar analyses performed on complementary probes. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of current and upcoming cosmic shear surveys.",
New submissions,Introduction to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST),CSST Collaboration,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a next-generation Stage-IV sky survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image quality, and multi-band observation capabilities.

New submissions,Cosmological Simulations with Massive Neutrinos: Efficiency and Accuracy,"Bing-Hang Chen,Jun-Jie Zhao,Hao-Ran Yu,Yu Liu,Jian-Hua He,Yipeng Jing",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Constraining neutrino mass through cosmological observations relies on precise simulations to calibrate their effects on large scale structure, while these simulations must overcome computational challenges like dealing with large velocity dispersions and small intrinsic neutrino perturbations. We present an efficient N-body implementation with semi-linear neutrino mass response which gives accurate power spectra and halo statistics. We explore the necessity of correcting the expansion history caused by massive neutrinos and the transition between relativistic and non-relativistic components. The above method of including neutrino masses is built into the memory-, scalability-, and precision-optimized parallel N-body simulation code CUBE 2.0. Through a suite of neutrino simulations, we precisely quantify the neutrino mass effects on the nonlinear matter power spectra and halo statistics.",
New submissions,Delensing CMB B-modes using galaxy surveys: the effect of galaxy bias and matter clustering non-linearities,"Shengzhu Wang,Antón Baleato Lizancos,José Luis Bernal",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The B-mode of polarization of the CMB is a uniquely powerful probe of gravitational waves produced in the very early Universe. But searches for primordial B-mode anisotropies must contend with gravitational lensing, which induces late-time B-modes not associated with gravitational waves. These lensing B-modes can be removed -- i.e., delensed -- using observations of the E-modes and a proxy of the matter fluctuations along the line of sight that caused the deflections. The number density and redshift reach of galaxy surveys such as the upcoming Rubin observatory offer attractive prospects for using them to delens B-mode data from CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD or CMB-S4. However, stochasticity and non-linear galaxy bias may in principle decorrelate the galaxy field from the matter distribution responsible for the lensing effect, thus hindering efforts to delens B-modes. In addition, non-linear gravitational evolution and bias introduce non-Gaussianities in the large-scale structure which further complicate the modelling. We quantify these effects by populating an N-body simulation with a magnitude-limited, photometric sample of galaxies similar to Rubin's gold selection, and using them to delens CMB maps lensed by the same matter distribution. We find that pipelines that treat the galaxy overdensity as a Gaussian field will incur negligible bias on the inferred tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. Moreover, we show that even in a highly conservative scenario where only the linear bias of the galaxies can be determined, the bias on r arising from this simplification is well within statistical uncertainties for a cosmic-variance limited scenario where Rubin-like galaxies are used for delensing.",
New submissions,On the interpretation of XRISM X-ray measurements of turbulence in the intracluster medium: a comparison with cosmological simulations,"F. Vazza,G. Brunetti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph),"We investigate whether the properties of turbulent gas motions recently measured via X-ray spectroscopy in the Coma cluster of galaxies by XRISM are in tension with the ""classical"" fluid picture of the intracluster medium on large scales, as produced by a typical high-resolution cosmological simulation. We use a high-resolution simulation of Coma-like cluster of galaxies and show that the Kolmogorov-like turbulence measured in the simulation yields to velocity structure functions and line-width that fully compatible with those measured by the XRISM observation of Coma. These results highlight the combined biases driven by the inhomogeneity of turbulence in the intracluster medium and by the X-ray weighting in observations, and appear to release the tension between the XRISM data and current numerical simulations, showing that a turbulent spectrum much steeper than Kolmogorov is not required by current observational data.",
New submissions,Introducing the Phoebos simulation: galaxy properties at the dawn of galaxy formation,"Floor van Donkelaar,Pedro R. Capelo,Lucio Mayer,Darren S. Reed,Thomas R. Quinn",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows us to observe galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-15$) with unprecedented detail, revealing their morphologies, sizes, and internal structures. These observations offer crucial insights into the physical processes driving early galaxy formation. In this work, we introduce the Phoebos hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, a state-of-the-art 100 Mpc volume designed to study the formation and evolution of galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn and into the epoch of reionization. Phoebos includes a stellar feedback model that is intentionally weak, in order to address the high abundance of massive galaxies seen by JWST at early epochs. At variance with most large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we do not employ an effective equation of state model, instead our radiative cooling model allows us to capture the multi-phase nature of the gas inside and around galaxies. Phoebos reproduces key observables of early galaxy formation at $z \gtrsim 8$, including the stellar mass function and the stellar-to-halo mass relation. It also recovers the observed slope of the stellar size-to-mass relation and matches the specific star formation rate remarkably well. These results suggest that highly efficient star formation in the presence of only mild regulation from stellar feedback, drives early galaxy growth, supporting a scenario of rapid stellar mass assembly during cosmic dawn. There are indications in the cosmic star formation density that, at lower redshifts, Phoebos might overpredict the stellar mass within the systems, suggesting that a transition to a stronger stellar feedback may be necessary to reproduce later-time observations. These results highlight the potential of Phoebos to interpret JWST observations and to probe the evolving physical processes that shape galaxy formation.",
New submissions,The EoR 21-cm Bispectrum at $z=8.2$ from MWA data I: Foregrounds and preliminary upper limits,"Sukhdeep Singh Gill,Somnath Bharadwaj,Khandakar Md Asif Elahi,Shiv K. Sethi,Akash Kumar Patwa",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We attempt to measure the $z = 8.2$ Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm bispectrum (BS) using Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) $154.2~\mathrm{MHz}$ data. We find that $B(k_{1\perp}, k_{2\perp}, k_{3\perp}, k_{1\parallel}, k_{2\parallel})$ the 3D cylindrical BS exhibits a foreground wedge, similar to $P(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$ the 21-cm cylindrical power spectrum. However, the BS foreground wedge, which depends on $(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$, $(k_{2\perp},k_{2\parallel})$ and $(k_{3\perp},k_{3\parallel})$ the three sides of a triangle, is more complicated. Considering various foreground avoidance scenarios, we identify the region where all three sides are outside the foreground wedge as the EoR window for the 21-cm BS. However, the EoR window is contaminated by a periodic pattern of spikes that arises from the periodic pattern of missing frequency channels in the data. We evaluate the binned 3D spherical BS for triangles of all possible sizes and shapes, and present results for $\Delta^3$ the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations. The best $2\sigma$ upper limits we obtain for the EoR 21-cm signal are $\Delta^3_{\rm UL} = (1.81\times 10^3)^3~\mathrm{mK}^3$ at $k_1 = 0.008~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Delta^3_{\rm UL} = (2.04\times 10^3)^3~\mathrm{mK}^3$ at $k_1 = 0.012~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for equilateral and squeezed triangles, respectively.

Evrard,Arya Farahi,Annalisa Pillepich,Dylan Nelson,Joop Schaye,Matthieu Schaller,Joey Braspenning",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We examine scale and redshift dependence of mass-property relations (MPRs) for five hot gas properties of two large group- and cluster-scale halo samples realized by the IllustrisTNG, TNG-Cluster and FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. For intrinsic properties of i) hot gas mass ($M_{\rm gas}$), ii) spectroscopic-like temperature ($T_{\rm sl}$), iii) soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and iv) X-ray ($Y_{\rm X}$) and v) Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ($Y_{\rm SZ}$) thermal energies, we use MPR parameters to infer mass proxy quality (MPQ) -- the implied scatter in total halo mass conditioned on a property -- for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} \geq 10^{13}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$ at redshifts, $z \in \{0, 0.5, 1, 2\}$. We find: (1) in general, scaling relation slopes and covariance display moderate to strong dependence on halo mass, with redshift dependence secondary, (2) for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} > 10^{14}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$, scalings of $M_{\rm gas}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$ simplify toward self-similar slope and constant intrinsic scatter (5 and 10%, respectively) nearly independent of scale, making both measures ideal for cluster finding and characterization to $z=2$, (3) halo mass-conditioned likelihoods of hot gas mass and thermal energy at fixed halo mass closely follow a log-normal form, (4) despite normalization differences ranging up to $0.4$ dex, there is good qualitative, and often quantitative, agreement between the scale-dependent slopes and property covariance of the two simulations. Slopes show appreciable redshift dependence at the group scale, while redshift dependence of the scatter is exhibited by low mass FLAMINGO halos only, (5) property correlations are largely consistent between the simulations, with values that mainly agree with existing empirical measurements. We close with a literature survey placing our MPR slopes and intrinsic scatter estimates into context.",
New submissions,Quantitative Morphology of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Optical Imaging,"Qing Liu,Peter Martin,Roberto Abraham,Pieter van Dokkum,Henk Hoekstra,Juan Miró-Carretero,William Bowman,Steven Janssens,Seery Chen,Deborah Lokhorst,Imad Pasha,Zili Shen",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering Transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250~$\mu m$, WISE 12~$\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS {\HI} column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.",
Cross submissions,Are gravitational waves consistent with other probes of gravity and dark energy?,Antonio Enea Romano,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window on the Universe, allowing to obtain constraints on dark energy and gravity independent from other electromagnetic waves observations, such as large scale structure (LSS). For the purpose of investigating the consistency between different observations the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy is a useful tool, allowing to derive model and parametrization independent consistency relations (CR) between the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity (EM) distance, and the speed of GWs. We test the constant brading CR, which is also satisfied by general relativity, by comparing for the first time the constraints obtained from LSS observations with those from GW events with and without electromagnetic counterparts, confirming the validity of the CR at the current level of experimental uncertainty. The event GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart provides a constraint of the effective gravitational constant with an accuracy comparable with LSS constraints, while the analysis of GW events without electromagnetic counterpart are consistent, but do not have a constraining power comparable to LSS observations. Beside allowing to test the consistency between independent observations, the CRs can be used to estimate the effective gravitational coupling with GWs at high redshift, where other observations are not available.",
Cross submissions,An Open System Approach to Gravity,"Santiago Agüí Salcedo,Thomas Colas,Lennard Dufner,Enrico Pajer",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Several major open problems in cosmology, including the nature of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, share a common structure: they involve spacetime-filling media with unknown microphysics, and can be probed so far only through their gravitational effects. This observation motivates a systematic open-system approach to cosmology, in which gravity evolves in the presence of a generic, unobservable environment. In this work, we develop a general framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial constraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our path integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in perturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime.As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of gravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are non-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it to include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the most general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation. Remarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is dissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at higher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case. Our results pave the way to modeling dissipative effects in the late universe.",
Cross submissions,Ring formation from black hole superradiance through repeated particle production on bound orbits,"Zhen-Hong Lyu,Rong-Gen Cai,Zong-Kuan Guo,Jian-Feng He,Jing Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Ultralight bosonic fields around a rotating black hole can extract energy and angular momentum through the superradiant instability and form a dense cloud. We investigate the scenario involving two scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$, with a coupling term $\frac{1}{2}\lambda\phi\chi^2$, which is motivated by the multiple-axion framework. The ultralight scalar $\phi$ forms a cloud that efficiently produces $\chi$ particles non-perturbatively via parametric resonance, with a large mass hierarchy, $\mu_\chi \gg \mu_\phi$. Rather than escaping the system as investigated by previous studies, these $\chi$ particles remain bound, orbiting the black hole. Moreover, the particle production occurs primarily at the peak of the cloud's profile, allowing $\chi$ particles in quasi-circular orbits to pass repeatedly through resonant regions, leading to sustained amplification. This selective process naturally forms a dense ring of $\chi$ particles, with a mass ratio to the cloud fixed by $(\mu_\phi/\mu_\chi)^2$. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for generating bound-state particles via parametric resonance, which also impacts the evolution of the cloud. This process can be probed through its imprint on binary dynamics and its gravitational-wave signatures.",

Marsh,Luca Visinelli",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Axions that couple to electromagnetism are produced in the early Universe by, among other channels, freeze-in via the Primakoff process. For sufficiently large axion masses, the same coupling causes the axions to decay into two photons, which subsequently ionize the intergalactic medium. If this decay occurs in the redshift range $20 \lesssim z \lesssim 1100$, then the contribution to the cosmic microwave background optical depth $\tau_{\rm reio}$ can lead to a conflict with observations, excluding models with sufficiently strongly coupled, heavy axions and high reheating temperatures, $T_{\rm reh}$. Using large ensembles of explicit type IIB string theory models with up to $h^{1,1} = 100$ axions, we compute the full cosmic reionization history caused by the decays of multiple axions. We compare this to the posterior on the high-$z$ component of $\tau_{\rm reio}$ derived from model-independent constraints on the ionization state of the Universe, obtained in a full \textit{Planck} analysis presented in a companion paper. For $h^{1,1} = 20, 50, 100$, we find that approximately 15\%, 15\%, and 10\% of the models in the ensemble prefer $T_{\rm reh} \lesssim 10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$ at 95\% CL. We provide a publicly available code at:~\href{this https URL}{this http URL}, which computes the reionization history for arbitrary ensembles of decaying axions. Our analysis opens the door for future large-scale work studying the preference for low-temperature reheating in models with multiple axions.",

A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale.

We consider a scenario where the number asymmetry is generated from the decay of a mother particle produced via parametric resonance during the phase transition induced due to its coupling to the dilaton associated with spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. It is shown that the correct baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance can be realized for a dark phase transition at $\mathcal{O}(1) \, \rm GeV$, which can also explain the nano-Hz gravitational wave signal reported by pulsar timing array experiments. The scenario will be tested further in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments.",
Cross submissions,Impact of flavor condensate dark matter on accretion disk luminosity in spherical spacetimes,"Antonio Capolupo,Orlando Luongo,Aniello Quaranta",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the impact of dark matter condensates on the emission and thermodynamic properties of accretion disks, in a spherically-symmetric and static background. We focus on a class of models where dark matter originates from a genuine mass mixing among neutrino fields and compute the corrections to the dark matter's potential within galactic halo. We find a corresponding Yukawa correction induced by the dark matter energy-momentum tensor over the Newtonian potential. In so doing, employing Schwarzschild coordinates, and adopting the Novikov-Thorne formalism, we compute the geodesic structure and the corresponding disk-integrated luminosity profiles. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate, constituted solely by baryonic matter, we find non-negligible deviations in both the disk structure and radiative output, as compared to the standard Schwarzschild case. Afterwards, we discuss physical consequences of our Yukawa correction, comparing it with recent literature, predicting similar potentials, albeit derived from extended theories of gravity. Accordingly, we thus speculate to use our results to distinguish among candidates of dark matter. Indeed, our findings suggest that incoming high-precision observations of accretion disk spectra may provide a tool to probe dark matter's nature under the form of particles, extended theories of gravity or condensates.",
Cross submissions,Stability and Thermodynamics of a Generalized Power-Law Dark Energy Model,"S. Kazemi,M. A. Ramzanpour,E. Yusofi,A. R. Amani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate a generalized power-law dark energy equation of state of the form $p = w\rho - \beta\rho^m$ in a flat FLRW universe, analyzing its dynamical stability and thermodynamic consistency. The model exhibits a rich phase space structure, with an effective cosmological constant $\rho^* = [(1+w)/\beta]^{1/(m-1)}$ emerging as a stable attractor for $(w < -1,~ m > 1)$. Notably, the universe evolves from an early de Sitter phase ($w \to -1$) to a late-time de Sitter-like one with phantom crossing ($w(z) < -1$), aligning with DESI observations. Dynamical analysis reveals that the $m > 1$ regime avoids ghost instabilities while accommodating phantom behavior, with $m = 2$ providing particular theoretical advantages. Thermodynamically, the Generalized Second Law holds when the null energy condition $\rho + p \geq 0$ is satisfied, which naturally occurs for $\rho \geq \rho^*$. The model's compatibility with both observational data and fundamental thermodynamic principles suggests it as a viable framework for describing late-time cosmic acceleration, resolving tensions associated with phantom crossing while maintaining entropy dominance of the cosmological horizon.",
Cross submissions,The Study on Modified Theories of General Relativity: A Differential Geometric Approach,N.S. Kavya,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The introduction of General Relativity (GR) in 1915 revolutionized our understanding of gravity, but over time, its limitations in explaining phenomena like dark energy, dark matter, and quantum gravity have motivated alternative theories. Early modifications, such as Weyl's 1919 proposal, focused on adding higher-order terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. GR's non-renormalizability further strengthened the case for extending it. A central theme of modern gravity research is modifying the geometric structure, often by changing the gravitational Lagrangian. This leads to theories such as teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel gravity, utilizing torsion or non-Levi-Civita connections, with differential geometry providing the essential framework.This thesis explores several modified gravity models. Chapter 1 introduces necessary mathematical tools. Chapter 2 develops a novel parametrization of the deceleration parameter, constrained using MCMC and observational data, and applies it to f(Q) gravity. Chapter 3 embeds the LambdaCDM model into f(Q, L\_m) gravity with non-minimal coupling, producing analytic solutions and matching observations through cosmographic analysis. Chapter 4 considers Bianchi-I spacetime in f(R, L\_m) gravity with observational constraints to measure anisotropy. Chapter 5 presents wormhole solutions in f(Q, T) gravity with conformal symmetries. Chapter 6 explores wormholes in f(R, L\_m) with non-commutative geometry, analyzing shape functions, energy conditions, and stability. Chapter 7 studies Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in f(T) gravity, constraining hybrid models using early- and late-time data, and validating intermediate epochs via cosmography.",

Such gravitational waves generate an irreducible and unavoidable stochastic background which is testable by current and future experiments. In particular, the presence of a primordial black hole ringdown allows to significantly constrain the idea of extremely supermassive black holes to comprise the entire dark matter of the universe.",
Cross submissions,Inflaton perturbations through an Ultra-Slow Roll transition and Hamilton-Jacobi attractors,"Tomislav Prokopec,Gerasimos Rigopoulos",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We examine the behaviour of the gauge invariant scalar field perturbations in an analytic inflationary model that transitions from slow roll to an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase. We find that the numerical solution of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation is well described by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) theory, as long as the appropriate branches of the Hamilton-Jacobi solutions are invoked: Modes that exit the horizon during the slow roll phase evolve into the USR as described by the first HJ branch, up to a subdominant $\mathcal{O}(k^2/H^2)$ correction to the Hamilton-Jacobi prediction for their final amplitude that we compute, indicating the influence of neglected gradient terms. Modes that exit during the USR phase are described by a separate HJ branch (very close to de Sitter) once they become sufficiently superhorizon, obtained by the shift $\epsilon_2 \rightarrow \tilde{\epsilon}_2\simeq \epsilon_2+6$. This transition is similar to the conveyor belt concept put forward in our previous work [1] and the intuition deriving from it. We further discuss implications for the validity of the stochastic equations arising from the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We conclude that if appropriately used, the Hamilton-Jacobi attractors can describe the dynamics of long wavelength inflationary inhomogeneities beyond slow roll.",

The model extends the Standard Model by introducing a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ and an approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry, each spontaneously broken by a corresponding complex scalar singlet. This setup gives rise to a network of effectively global and local cosmic strings, whose stochastic gravitational wave signals can jointly account for the spectrum observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, particularly for majoron masses $m_{\chi} < 10^{-23}$ eV. Although the fit is not as strong as that from supermassive black hole mergers, the model still provides an alternative explanation rooted in high-energy physics. The model also generates light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and avoids cosmological constraints from $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$, CMB anisotropies, and isocurvature fluctuations. Although the majoron can contribute to dark matter through thermal, coherent oscillation, and string-induced production mechanisms, its relic abundance remains subdominant in the NANOGrav-compatible region. In contrast, the measured dark matter relic density is achievable at higher $m_\chi$, though at the cost of tension with cosmological bounds. If the NANOGrav fits are viewed as constraints, given their comparatively lower Bayes factors, they yield bounds that are significantly stronger than those imposed by the CMB and other cosmological data.",

Oikonomou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The theory controlling the Universe's evolution in the classical regime has to be motivated by particle physics reasoning and should also generate inflation and dark energy eras in a unified way. One such framework is $F(R)$ gravity. In this work we examine a class of exponential deformations of $R^2$ gravity motivated by fundamental physics of scalaron evolution in a de Sitter background. As we show this class of models describe both inflation and the dark energy era in a viable way compatible with the Planck constraints on inflation and the cosmological parameters. Regarding the inflationary era, the exponentially deformed $R^2$ model also yields a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term which remarkably does not affect the dynamics and the inflationary evolution is identical to that of an $R^2$ model. The dark energy era is also found to be viable and mimics the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. More importantly, this class of $F(R)$ gravity exponential $R^2$ deformations also has an important characteristic, and specifically it yields total equation of state oscillations deeply in the matter domination era, for redshifts $z\sim 3400$, so near the matter-radiation equality. These total equation of state deformations at such a large redshift may directly affect the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. Indeed as we show, the effect is measurable and it leads to an enhancement of the tensor perturbations energy spectrum for low frequencies probed by the future LiteBIRD mission. This enhancement might have a measurable effect on the $B$-modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and thus may be detectable by the LiteBIRD mission. Only a handful of theoretical frameworks can generate the gravitational wave pattern generated by the class of exponentially deformed $R^2$ models we presented.",

The cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles is constrained by various experiments, with the limits given as functions of the monopole velocity (Lorentz factor) at the detectors. The velocity, however, is usually treated as a free parameter due to the ambiguity in the computation of the acceleration before the monopoles arrive at Earth. We explicitly evaluate the velocity by exploiting recent studies on cosmic magnetic fields and the monopole acceleration therein, to recast experimental limits in terms of the mass of monopoles. By applying our method to various terrestrial experiments, including the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, MACRO, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as well as to astrophysical constraints, we report limits on the flux of monopoles for a wide range of monopole masses. We also highlight the role of monopoles as messengers of cosmic magnetic fields, and discuss the possibility of using monopole experiments to probe intergalactic magnetic fields.",
