New submissions,A Fog Over the Cosmological SGWB: Unresolved Massive Black Hole Binaries in the LISA Band,"Mesut Çalışkan,Neha Anil Kumar,Marc Kamionkowski,Sihao Cheng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Disentangling the rich astrophysical structure of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from its cosmological component is essential for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to access the physics of the early Universe beyond the reach of any other probe. In this work, we develop an analytical framework to compute the astrophysical contribution to the SGWB arising from an unresolved ensemble of inspiraling and merging black hole binaries. Accounting for various resolvability thresholds, we leverage this framework to predict the amplitude, spectral shape, and detection signal-to-noise ratio of the unresolved background from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), capturing the possible diversity of its SGWB imprint across a range of astrophysically motivated populations. Through a joint analysis of astrophysical and primordial contributions to the SGWB, we determine the minimum detectable amplitude of the cosmological background across a range of spectral shapes. We demonstrate that, even under optimistic subtraction thresholds, unresolved MBHBs can degrade the detectability of a cosmological signal by multiple orders of magnitude, depending on the spectral shape of the primordial component. Ultimately, the MBHB-induced astrophysical SGWB acts both as a veil and a lens: it imposes a fundamental limit on cosmological sensitivity, yet simultaneously reveals the hidden population of massive black holes beyond the reach of individual detections. Accurate modeling of this late-Universe background is therefore a prerequisite for robust component separation and for realizing LISA's full scientific potential.",

Moscardini",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Euclid mission and other next-generation large-scale structure surveys will enable high-precision measurements of the cosmic matter distribution. Understanding the impact of baryonic processes such as star formation and AGN feedback on matter clustering is crucial to ensure precise and unbiased cosmological inference. Most theoretical models of baryonic effects to date focus on two-point statistics, neglecting higher-order contributions. This work develops a fast and accurate emulator for baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum, a key non-Gaussian statistic in the nonlinear regime. We employ high-resolution $N$-body simulations from the BACCO suite and apply a combination of cutting-edge techniques such as cosmology scaling and baryonification to efficiently span a large cosmological and astrophysical parameter space. A deep neural network is trained to emulate baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum measured in simulations, capturing modifications across various scales and redshifts relevant to Euclid. We validate the emulator accuracy and robustness using an analysis of \Euclid mock data, employing predictions from the state-of-the-art FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations. The emulator reproduces baryonic suppression in the bispectrum to better than 2$\%$ for the $68\%$ percentile across most triangle configurations for $k \in [0.01, 20]\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ and ensures consistency between cosmological posteriors inferred from second- and third-order weak lensing statistics.",

Weaver,Hu Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Quasar spectra carry the imprint of foreground intergalactic medium (IGM) through absorption features. In particular, absorption caused by neutral hydrogen gas, the ``Ly$\alpha$ forest,'' is a key spectroscopic tracer for cosmological analyses used to measure cosmic expansion and test physics beyond the standard model. Despite their importance, current methods for measuring LyA absorption cannot directly derive the intrinsic quasar continuum and make strong assumptions on its shape, thus distorting the measured LyA clustering. We present SpenderQ, a ML-based approach for directly reconstructing the intrinsic quasar spectra and measuring the LyA forest from observations. SpenderQ uses the Spender spectrum autoencoder to learn a compact and redshift-invariant latent encoding of quasar spectra, combined with an iterative procedure to identify and mask absorption regions. To demonstrate its performance, we apply SpenderQ to 400,000 synthetic quasar spectra created to validate the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year 1 LyA cosmological analyses. SpenderQ accurately reconstructs the true intrinsic quasar spectra, including the broad LyB, LyA, SiIV, CIV, and CIII emission lines. Redward of LyA, SpenderQ provides percent-level reconstructions of the true quasar spectra. Blueward of LyA, SpenderQ reconstructs the true spectra to < 5\%. SpenderQ reproduces the shapes of individual quasar spectra more robustly than the current state-of-the-art. We, thus, expect it will significantly reduce biases in LyA clustering measurements and enable studies of quasars and their physical properties. SpenderQ also provides informative latent variable encodings that can be used to, e.g., classify quasars with Broad Absorption Lines. Overall, SpenderQ provides a new data-driven approach for unbiased LyA forest measurements in cosmological, quasar, and IGM studies.",
New submissions,Dark Energy Crosses the Line: Quantifying and Testing the Evidence for Phantom Crossing,"Emre Özülker,Eleonora Di Valentino,William Giarè",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Combinations of the most recent CMB, BAO, and SNeIa datasets, when analyzed using the CPL parametrization, $w(a) = w_0 + (1 - a) w_a$, exclude $\Lambda$CDM at $\gtrsim\!3\sigma$ in favor of a dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameter that crosses the phantom divide. We confirm this behavior and show that it persists when DESI BAO data are replaced by SH0ES $H_0$ measurements, despite the known tension between these probes in the presence of CMB data. In both cases, the constraints favor a transition from an early-time phantom-like phase to a late-time quintessence-like phase, with the crossing occurring at different redshifts depending on the dataset combination. The probability that a phantom divide line (PDL) crossing does not occur within the expansion history is excluded at significance levels ranging between $3.1\sigma$-$5.2\sigma$. To investigate whether the apparent PDL crossing is a genuine feature preferred by the data or an artifact of the linear form of the CPL parametrization, we isolate the PDL crossing feature by introducing two modified versions of CPL that explicitly forbid it: CPL${}_{>a_\mathrm{c}}$ and CPL${}_{<a_\mathrm{c}}$. These models are physically motivated in that they phenomenologically capture the behavior of thawing and freezing scalar field scenarios. While previous studies have primarily considered thawing quintessence as a non-crossing alternative, we find that a freezing phantom-like model is the only one capable of performing comparably to CPL -- and only in a few cases. Nevertheless, across all dataset combinations considered, the standard CPL model consistently provides the best fit, strongly indicating that the data genuinely favor a PDL crossing.",
New submissions,Detectability of the 21 cm signal with BINGO through cross-correlation with photometric surveys,"Gabriel A. S. Silva,Camila P. Novaes,Carlos A. Wuensche,Eduardo J. de Mericia,Bruno B. Bizarria,Jiajun Zhang,Elcio Abdalla,Filipe B. Abdalla,Amilcar R. Queiroz,Thyrso Villela,Bin Wang,Chang Feng,Edmar C. Gurjao,Alessandro Marins",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"21 cm intensity mapping (HI IM) can efficiently map large cosmic volumes with good redshift resolution, but systematics and foreground contamination pose major challenges for extracting accurate cosmological information. Cross-correlation with galaxy surveys offers an efficient mitigation strategy, as both datasets have largely uncorrelated systematics. We evaluate the detectability of the 21 cm signal from the BINGO radio telescope by cross-correlating with the LSST photometric survey, given their strong overlap in area and redshift. Using lognormal simulations, we model the cosmological signal in the BINGO frequency range (980 - 1260 MHz), incorporating thermal noise, foregrounds, and cleanup. The LSST simulations include uncertainties in photometric redshift (photo-z) and galaxy number density in the first three redshift intervals (mean redshift approximately equal to 0.25, 0.35, 0.45), corresponding to the expected performance after 10 years of the survey. We show that photo-z errors significantly increase the noise in the cross-correlation, reducing its statistical significance to levels comparable to those of the autocorrelation. Still, the HI signal remains detectable through the cross-correlation, even with photo-z uncertainties similar to those of the LSST. Our results corroborate the feasibility of this approach under realistic conditions and motivate further refinement of the current analysis methods.",
New submissions,Constraining exotic high-$z$ reionization histories with Gaussian processes and the cosmic microwave background,"Hanyu Cheng,Ziwen Yin,Eleonora Di Valentino,David J. E. Marsh,Luca Visinelli",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The large-angle polarization anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are generated by Thomson scattering of CMB photons off free electrons in the post-recombination Universe. In the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmological model, the free electron density becomes large at redshifts $z \lesssim 10$ due to the formation of the first stars, leading to reionization of the intergalactic medium. In this work, we use \emph{Gaussian processes} to give a model-independent reconstruction of the reionization history of the Universe constrained by the \textit{Planck} CMB measurements. This method gives a consistent reconstruction of the standard reionization at $z \lesssim 10$, and strongly constrains any additional high-$z$ reionization. We use our results to construct a new derived parameter expressing the high-$z$ contribution to the CMB optical depth, $\tau_{\mathrm{highz}}$. The posterior distribution on $\tau_{\mathrm{highz}}$ can be used to set accurate constraints on models for exotic energy injection, which we demonstrate for the case of decaying dark matter with particle mass in the range $\mathcal{O}(1\,\text{MeV})$. A companion paper demonstrates the use of this methodology to test ensembles of multi-axion models. Our results can be recast to different models using the provided data and code: \href{this https URL}{this http URL\_reio\_gpr}.",
New submissions,Time dilation observed in Type Ia supernova light curves and its cosmological consequences,Vaclav Vavrycuk,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The cosmic time dilation observed in Type Ia supernova light curves suggests that the passage of cosmic time varies throughout the evolution of the Universe. This observation implies that the rate of proper time is not constant, as assumed in the standard FLRW metric, but instead is time-dependent. Consequently, the commonly used FLRW metric should be replaced by a more general framework, known as the Conformal Cosmology (CC) metric, to properly account for cosmic time dilation. The CC metric incorporates both spatial expansion and time dilation during cosmic evolution. As a result, it is necessary to distinguish between comoving and proper (physical) time, similar to the distinction made between comoving and proper distances. In addition to successfully explaining cosmic time dilation, the CC metric offers several further advantages: (1) it preserves Lorentz invariance, (2) it maintains the form of Maxwell's equations as in Minkowski space-time, (3) it eliminates the need for dark matter and dark energy in the Friedmann equations, and (4) it successfully predicts the expansion and morphology of spiral galaxies in agreement with observations.",
New submissions,On the initial conditions of the $ν$HDM cosmological model,"Nick Samaras,Sebastian Grandis,Pavel Kroupa",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The $\nu$HDM is the only cosmological model based on Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) with available structure formation simulations. While MOND accounts for galaxies, with a priori predictions for spirals and ellipticals, a light sterile neutrino of 11 eV can assist in recovering scaling relations on the galaxy-cluster scales. In order to perform MONDian cosmological simulations in this theoretical approach, initial conditions derived from a fit to the angular power spectrum of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations are required. In this work, we employ CosmoSIS to perform a Bayesian study of the $\nu$HDM model. Using the best-fit values of the posterior, the CMB power spectrum is reevaluated. The excess of power in the transfer function implies a distinct evolution scenario, which can be used further as an input for a set of hydro-dynamical calculations. The resulting values H0 $\approx$ 56 km/s/Mpc and ${\Omega}_{m_{0}} \approx 0.5$ are far from agreement with respect to the best fit ones in the canonical Cold Dark Matter model, but may be significant in MONDian cosmology. The assumed Planck CMB initial conditions are only valid for the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This work constitutes a first step in an iterative procedure needed to disentangle the model dependence of the derived initial density and velocity fields.",
New submissions,A Fast Bayesian Method for Coherent Gravitational Wave Searches with Relative Astrometry,"Benjamin Zhang,Kris Pardo,Yijun Wang,Luke Bouma,Tzu-Ching Chang,Olivier Doré",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Using relative stellar astrometry for the detection of coherent gravitational wave sources is a promising method for the microhertz range, where no dedicated detectors currently exist. Compared to other gravitational wave detection techniques, astrometry operates in an extreme high-baseline-number and low-SNR-per-baseline limit, which leads to computational difficulties when using conventional Bayesian search techniques. We extend a technique for efficiently searching pulsar timing array datasets through the precomputation of inner products in the Bayesian likelihood, showing that it is applicable to astrometric datasets. Using this technique, we are able to reduce the total dataset size by up to a factor of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while remaining accurate to within 1% over two orders of magnitude in gravitational wave frequency. Applying this technique to simulated astrometric datasets for the Kepler Space Telescope and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope missions, we obtain forecasts for the sensitivity of these missions to coherent gravitational waves. Due to the low angular sky coverage of astrometric baselines, we find that coherent gravitational wave sources are poorly localized on the sky. Despite this, from $10^{-8}$ Hz to $10^{-6}$ Hz, we find that Roman is sensitive to coherent gravitational waves with an instantaneous strain above $h_0 \simeq 10^{-11.4}$, and Kepler is sensitive to strains above $h_0 \simeq $ $10^{-12.4}$. At this strain, we can detect a source with a frequency of $10^{-7}$ Hz and a chirp mass of $10^9$ $M_\odot$ at a luminosity distance of 3.6 Mpc for Kepler, and 0.3 Mpc for Roman.",
New submissions,Detectability of dark matter density distribution via gravitational waves from binary black holes in the Galactic center,"Zhijin Li,Xiao Guo,Zhoujian Cao,Yun-Long Zhang",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.",
New submissions,Sensitivity of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Dark Ages to parameters of primordial magnetic fields,"Bohdan Novosyadlyj,Yurii Kulinich,Nazar Fortuna,Anton Rudakovskyi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We analyze the impact of the decaying magnetic turbulence of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) and ambipolar diffusion on the ionization and thermal history of the Dark Ages Universe ($30\le z\le300$), and its imprint on the spectral profile of the global signal in the 21 cm hydrogen line. The heating function caused by decaying magnetic turbulence monotonically decreases after cosmological recombination, its amplitude strongly depends on the strength of the PMFs $B_0$ and weakly depends on the spectral index of the initial power spectrum of PMFs $n_{\rm B}$. The heating function caused by ambipolar diffusion, in contrast, noticeably depends on the spectral index in the range $-3\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim-1$, but is subdominant in the Dark Ages epoch for PMF models with $B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG. We computed the ionization and thermal history of intergalactic gas from the cosmological recombination up to the end of the Dark Ages epoch for a range of PMF parameters $0.05\lesssim B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG, $-2.9\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim4$ and show the essentially distinguished thermal evolution from one in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also show that the profile of the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line is very sensitive to the PMF parameters from this range and can be used for their constraints in conjunction with other observational data.",
New submissions,Tracing Cosmic Voids with fast simulations,"M. D. Lepinzan,C. T. Davies,T. Castro,N. Schuster,J. Mohr,P. Monaco",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Context. Cosmic voids are vast underdense regions in the cosmic web that encode crucial information about structure formation, the composition of the Universe, and its expansion history. Due to their lower density, these regions are less affected by non-linear gravitational dynamics, making them suitable candidates for analysis using semi-analytic methods. Aims. We assess the accuracy of the PINOCCHIO code, a fast tool for generating dark matter halo catalogs based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, in modeling the statistical properties of cosmic voids. We validate this approach by comparing the resulting void statistics measured from PINOCCHIO to those obtained from N-body simulations. Methods. We generate a set of simulations using PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, assuming a fiducial cosmology and varying the resolution. For a given resolution, the simulations share the same initial conditions between the different simulation codes. Snapshots are saved at multiple redshifts for each simulation and post-processed using the watershed void finder VIDE to identify cosmic voids. For each simulation code, we measure the following statistics: void size function, void ellipticity function, core density function, and the void radial density profile. We use these statistics to quantify the accuracy of PINOCCHIO relative to OpenGADGET3 in the context of cosmic voids. Results. We find agreement for all void statistics at better than 2{\sigma} between PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, with no systematic difference in redshift trends. This demonstrates that the PINOCCHIO code can reliably produce void statistics with high computational efficiency compared to full N-body simulations.",

To maximise the scientific return of such surveys, complementary data are required for cluster confirmation and redshift estimation. This is typically provided by wide-field optical and infrared surveys, which are increasingly challenged by ongoing and future ICM-selected samples. In particular, at high redshifts ($z>1$) probed by upcoming SZE-selected samples, current large surveys may be insufficient for reliable confirmation. Deep, high-resolution infrared surveys like Euclid will thus be essential for confirming most high-redshift clusters. We present an analysis of the first sizeable Euclid dataset (Q1), overlapping with several ICM-selected cluster samples. We apply an adaptation of the MCMF cluster confirmation tool to estimate key properties, including redshift and richness, and to predict Euclid's capabilities for high-redshift cluster confirmation. We find promising performance, particularly at high redshifts, while richness estimates at low redshifts ($z<0.4$) are currently limited by Q1 data quality but should improve with future releases. Using MCMF runs on random lines of sight, we predict that Euclid will confirm clusters at $1<z<2$ as effectively as current optical surveys at $z<0.6$, significantly enhancing high-redshift confirmation. SZE-selected samples will thus greatly benefit from Euclid overlap. Among five known high-$z$ SZE clusters in Q1, we identify the highest-redshift jellyfish galaxy candidate to date, EUCLJ035330.86$-$504347.6 in SPT-CLJ0353$-$5043 ($z=1.32$), two massive star-forming galaxies near ACT-CLJ0350.0$-$4819 ($z=1.46$), and strong lensing features in SPT-CLJ0353$-$5043 and SPT-CLJ0421$-$4845.",
New submissions,Black Holes in the Red-sequence Elliptical Galaxies at Redshifts $\sim 0.7-2.5$: Not Dark Energy Source but Remanants of Little Red Dots,"Lei Lei,Ze-Fan Wang,Yi-Ying Wang,Lei Feng,Yi-Zhong Fan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The nature of dark energy remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern cosmology. One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be the astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling mechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the black hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts $\leq 2.5$. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we show that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy has been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10$\sigma$. Moreover, it turns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized by the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red-sequence elliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the redshifts of $\sim 0.7-2.5$, without the need of black hole cosmological coupling.",
New submissions,XMM-Newton follow-up of a sample of apparent low surface brightness galaxy groups detected in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey,"Claudia Spinelli,Angie Veronica,Florian Pacaud,Thomas H. Reiprich,Konstantinos Migkas,Weiwei Xu,Miriam E. Ramos-Ceja",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxy cluster cosmology relies on complete and pure samples spanning a large range of masses and redshifts. In Xu et al. (2018) and Xu et al. (2022), we discovered an apparently new population of galaxy groups and clusters with, on average, flatter X-ray surface brightness profiles than known clusters; this cluster population was missed in previous cluster surveys. The discovery of such a new class of objects could have a significant impact on cosmological applications of galaxy clusters. In this work we use a subsample of these systems to assess whether they belong to a new population. We follow up three of these galaxy groups and clusters with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We produce clean images and spectra and use them for model fitting. We also identify known galaxies, groups, or clusters in the field. The observations reveal that all three systems are composed of multiple groups each, either at the same or at different redshifts. In total, we characterize nine groups. We measure flat surface brightness profiles with slope parameter $\beta < 0.6$; i.e, less than the canonical $\beta = 2/3$. For the two main central groups, we even measure $\beta < 0.4$. When the fluxes for the three observations are split up across the nine identified groups, none of them exceeds the typical flux limit adopted in previous RASS cluster catalogs, $\approx 3 \times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{erg s^{-1}cm^{-2}}$ in the 0.1$-$2.4 keV energy band. The observations reveal that groups with flat surface brightness profiles exist. Whether they form a new, separate population requires additional follow-up observations of further systems from the Xu et al. sample, given the complexity we have discovered. Such extended low surface brightness systems, as well as multiple systems and projection effects, need to be taken into account when determining selection functions of group and cluster samples.",
New submissions,Non-Gaussian statistics in galaxy weak lensing: compressed three-point correlations and cosmological forecasts,"Sofia Samario-Nava,Alejandro Aviles,Juan Carlos Hidalgo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Building on previous developments of a harmonic decomposition framework for computing the three-point correlation function (3PCF) of projected scalar fields over the sky, this work investigates how much cosmological information is contained in these higher-order statistics. We perform a forecast to determine the number of harmonic multipoles required to capture the full information content of the 3PCF in the context of galaxy weak lensing, finding that only the first few multipoles are sufficient to capture the additional cosmological information provided by the 3PCF. This study addresses a critical practical question: to what extent can the high-dimensional 3PCF signal be compressed without significant loss of cosmological information? Since the different multipoles contain highly redundant information, we apply a principal component analysis (PCA) which further reduces its dimensionality and preserving information. We also account for non-linear parameter degeneracies using the DALI method, an extension of Fisher forecasting that includes higher-order likelihood information. Under optimistic settings, we find that the 3PCF improves considerably the constraining power of the 2PCF for the matter abundance $\Omega_m$ and fluctuations amplitude $\sigma_8$ by about 18% for galaxy maps at redshift $z=0.5$. However, for the amplitude $S_8$ and the equation of state parameter of dark energy, $w_0$, the improvements are very modest. Thanks to the harmonic basis and PCA, the method can be implemented with relatively low computational cost, providing a practical tool for current and future photometric surveys.",
New submissions,Evolution of Cluster Alignments as Evidence of Large-scale Structure Formation in the Universe,"Michael J. West,Roberto De Propris,Maret Einasto,Z.L. Wen,J.L. Han",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The universe's large-scale structure forms a vast, interconnected network of filaments, sheets, and voids known as the cosmic web. For decades, astronomers have observed that the orientations of neighboring galaxy clusters within these elongated structures are often aligned over separations of tens of Mpc. Using the largest available catalog of galaxy clusters, we show for the first time that clusters orientations are correlated over even larger scales, up to 200-300 comoving Mpc, and such alignments are seen to redshifts of at least z = 1. Comparison with numerical simulations suggests that coherent structures on similar scales may be expected in LCDM models.",
Cross submissions,Theoretical uncertainties for primordial black holes from cosmological phase transitions,"Maciej Kierkla,Nicklas Ramberg,Philipp Schicho,Daniel Schmitt",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Strongly supercooled first-order phase transitions have been proposed as a primordial black hole (PBH) production mechanism. While previous works rely on simplified models with limited thermodynamic precision, we stress that reliable theoretical PBH predictions require precise nucleation dynamics within realistic, classically conformal extensions of the Standard Model. By employing high-temperature dimensional reduction and computing the one-loop fluctuation determinants, we provide a state-of-the-art thermodynamic analysis and estimate the corresponding PBH abundance for classically conformal gauge-Higgs theories. Accounting for constraints from successful percolation and QCD chiral symmetry breaking, the parameter space where PBHs are viable dark matter candidates is severely limited.",
Cross submissions,ALPy Cogenesis,"Disha Bandyopadhyay,Debasish Borah,Arnab Dasgupta",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a novel cogenesis scenario by utilising the two-body decay of heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) via an effective operator involving an axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter (DM) and a light chiral fermion $\nu_R$. This allows the two-body decay of heavy RHN into $\nu_R$ and ALP thereby generating a lepton asymmetry in $\nu_R$ which later gets transferred to left-handed leptons via sizeable Yukawa coupling with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. The asymmetry in left-handed leptons is then converted into baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. The lepton number violation by heavy RHN also induces a one-loop Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ rendering the light neutrinos to be Majorana fermions. Successful leptogenesis constrain the parameter space in terms of RHN mass and axion decay constant. This has interesting consequences for both ALP and QCD axion DM parameter space within reach of several ongoing and near future experiments. We also propose a Dirac version of this scenario without any total lepton number violation. This leads to a long-lived asymmetric Dirac fermion contributing partially to DM thereby opening up more parameter space for ALP. In addition to axion search experiments, the proposed scenarios can have observable signatures at cosmic microwave background (CMB), DM search as well as terrestrial particle physics experiments.",
Cross submissions,Cosmological perturbations for smooth sign-switching dark energy models,"Mariam Bouhmadi-López,Beñat Ibarra-Uriondo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant. Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.",
Cross submissions,Bispectrum Islands,"Claudia de Rham,Sadra Jazayeri,Andrew J. Tolley",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inspired by the amplitude bootstrap program, the spirit of this work is to constrain the space of consistent inflationary correlation functions - specifically, the bispectrum of curvature perturbations - using fundamental principles such as unitarity, locality, analyticity, and symmetries. To this end, we assume a setup for inflation in which de Sitter isometries are only mildly broken by the slow roll of the inflaton field, and study the bispectrum imprinted by a generic hidden sector during inflation. Assuming that the hidden sector's contributions to primordial non-Gaussianity are dominated by the exchange of a scalar operator (which does not preclude high-spin UV completions), we derive nontrivial positivity constraints on the resulting bispectrum $B(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. In particular, we show that $B$ must be negative in a certain region around the equilateral configuration. For instance, for isosceles triangles (with $k_2=k_3$) this region is given by $0.027\lesssim k_3/k_1\leq 2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unitarity imposes upper and lower bounds on the bispectrum shape, thereby carving out a Bispectrum Island where consistent shapes in our setup can reside. We complement our analysis by contemplating alternative setups where the coupling to the hidden sector is allowed to strongly break de Sitter boosts. We also identify situations that would push the bispectrum off the island and the profound physical features they would reveal.",
Cross submissions,Higher co-dimension de Sitter branes,"Florian Niedermann,Antonio Padilla",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We extend the arguments of Maldacena and Núñez to include higher co-dimension brane setups and derive a new no-go theorem. Specifically, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the energy-momentum conservation and the bulk curvature, co-dimension-two branes fail to support stable de Sitter solutions. For co-dimensions higher than two embedded in a compact internal space, we show that negative tension sources would be required. This result places strong constraints on the viability of higher-dimensional braneworld models as a means to obtain de Sitter space within string theory.",
