New submissions,On the extraction of Alcock-Paczynski signal from voids: a novel approach via reconstruction,"G. Degni,E. Sarpa,M. Aubert,E. Branchini,A. Pisani,H.M. Courtois",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The void galaxy cross correlation function is a powerful tool to extract cosmological information. Through the void galaxy cross correlation function, cosmic voids, the underdense regions in the galaxy distribution, are used for refined deductions of the Universe's content by correcting apparent geometric distortions. This study proposes a novel procedure for optimally extracting the Alcock Paczynski, AP, signal from cosmic voids through a cosmological reconstruction technique. Employing cosmological reconstruction, specifically using the Zel'dovich approximation, we estimate the true positions of galaxies from their redshift space locations, reducing distortions introduced by peculiar velocities. Unlike previous analyses, we identify voids and measure the void galaxy cross correlation function directly in reconstructed space. This approach enables us, for the first time, to include in our analysis small nonlinear voids, typically discarded in previous studies, thus enhancing the statistical power of void studies and significantly improving their cosmological constraining power. Reconstruction is particularly effective even at small scales for voids, due to their clean and dynamically simple environment. This ability to recover information encoded on small scales significantly enhances the precision of the analysis, leading to a 23 % improvement in the constraints on the AP parameters compared to previous methods where the analysis is performed in redshift space and, consequently, to a better estimate of the derived cosmological parameters. Our analysis also includes a comprehensive set of consistency checks, demonstrating its robustness. We expect this methodology to yield a substantial gain in constraining power when applied to data from modern large scale structure surveys.",
New submissions,A New Boundary Condition on Reionization,"Sarah Libanore,Ely D. Kovetz,Julian B. Munoz,Yonatan Sklansky,Emilie Thélie",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The epoch of reionization (EoR) marks the last phase transition of hydrogen in our Universe, as it evolves from cold and neutral to hot and ionized in the intergalactic medium (IGM). While its endpoint and duration can be estimated from current observations, albeit with large uncertainties, there is no known avenue to constrain its onset. We propose a novel method based on the Pearson cross-correlation coefficient between 21-cm brightness temperature maps and line-intensity maps tracing star-formation (e.g., OIII, CO, CII). This real-space estimator evolves from negative to positive as X-ray heating progresses, and saturates prior to the EoR. We predict a sharp turnover from saturation during the earliest EoR stages, when the IGM ionized fraction reaches $\bar{x}_{\rm HII}\sim 1\%-10\%$. We show that in standard scenarios, where the IGM heating precedes reionization, the turnover is a clear, model-robust signature. Its detection will provide a unique observational anchor for the EoR onset, complementing existing probes and tightening constraints on early galaxy formation models.",
New submissions,Magnetic fields in galactic environments probed by Fast Radio Bursts,"Ilya S. Khrykin,Nicolas Tejos,J. Xavier Prochaska,Alexandra Mannings,Lluis Mas-Ribas,Kentaro Nagamine,Khee-Gan Lee,Bryan Gaensler,Zhao Joseph Zhang,Lucas Bernales-Cortes",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"FRBs constitute a unique probe of various astrophysical and cosmological environments via their characteristic dispersion and rotation (RM) measures that encode information about the ionized gas traversed by the FRB sightlines. In this work, we analyse observed RM measured for 14 localized FRBs at $0.05 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.5$, to infer total magnetic fields in various galactic environments. Additionally, we calculate $f_{\rm gas}$ - the average fraction of halo baryons in the ionized CGM. We build a spectroscopic dataset of FRB foreground galaxy halos, acquired with VLT/MUSE and FLIMFLAM survey. We develop a novel Bayesian algorithm and use it to correlate the individual intervening halos with the observed RM. This approach allows us to disentangle the magnetic fields present in various environments traversed by the FRB. Our analysis yields the first direct FRB constraints on the strength of magnetic fields in the ISM and halos of the FRB host galaxies, as well as in halos of foreground galaxies. We find that the average magnetic field in the ISM of FRB hosts is $B_{\rm host}^{\rm local} = 5.44^{+1.13}_{-0.87}\mu{\rm G}$. Additionally, we place upper limits on average magnetic field in FRB host halos, $B_{\rm host}^{\rm halo} < 4.81\mu{\rm G}$, and in foreground intervening halos, $B_{\rm f/g}^{\rm halo} < 4.31\mu{\rm G}$. Moreover, we estimate the average fraction of cosmic baryons inside $10 \lesssim \log_{10} \left( M_{\rm halo} / M_{\odot}\right) \lesssim 13.1$ halos $f_{\rm gas} = 0.45^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$. We find that the magnetic fields inferred in this work are in good agreement with previous measurements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed FRB RMs and have not considered contributions from the halos of the foreground and/or FRB host galaxies, we show that they can contribute a non-negligible amount of RM and must be taken into account when analysing future FRB samples.",
New submissions,On the Reliability of Quasars as Cosmological Distance Indicators,"Ariadna Montiel,Sofia Samario-Nava,Juan Carlos Hidalgo,Jose Ignacio Cabrera",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The goal of the present paper is to assess the usefulness of quasars as cosmological distance indicators. We calibrate, in a model-independent way, the non-linear relation between X-ray and UV emission to derive quasar luminosity distances. Using this calibration, we construct the Hubble diagram up to redshift $z \sim 7.5$, and test the ability of quasars to constrain the $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega$CDM models at low and high redshifts, in combination with the Type Ia supernova Pantheon Plus sample, as well as the latest results from DESI and Planck Compressed data. We find consistency with previous studies in the values of $\gamma$ and $\beta$ when using a quasar subsample with $z<1.43$. However, when the data is used to constrain the cosmological models, we find that quasars fail as reliable distance indicators, even when combined with other independent cosmological datasets.",
New submissions,"Decays and annihilation of galactic dark matter: determine $D$-, $J_s$-, $J_p$- and $J_d$-factors with dark matter profiles inferred from GravSphere fit to stellar observations","Fedor Bezrukov,Dmitry Gorbunov,Ekaterina Koreshkova",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Dark matter mass density profiles and velocity distributions for a set of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) have recently been obtained (this http URL,this http URL,this http URLarXiv:2412.20585) by performing a multi-parametric fit to the stellar observations with the help of the GravSphere which solves the Jeans equation. We use these results to calculate the geometrical factors for estimation of the fluxes of cosmic rays expected from decay ($D$-factor) and annihilation ($J_s$-, $J_p$- and $J_d$-factors for $s$-, $p$- and $d$- wave processes) of dark matter particles in galaxies. The general novelty is the account for a possible anisotropy in velocities of dark matter particles. On the basis of this analysis we present empirical scaling approximations to these factors as functions of typical observables: distance to the galaxy $d$, it's half-radius $r_h$ and line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_{LOS}$. They can be applied to any galaxy, and for $D$- and $J_s$-factors we refine the estimates of (Andrew B. Pace, Louis E. StrigariarXiv:1802.06811): the shifts in the central values remain within 1-2$\sigma$ error bars.",
New submissions,On the True Significance of the Hubble Tension: A Bayesian Error Decomposition Accounting for Information Loss,"Nathalia M. N. da Rocha,Andre L. B. Ribeiro,Francisco B. S. Oliveira",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Hubble tension, a persistent discrepancy between early and late Universe measurements of $H_0$, poses a significant challenge to the standard cosmological model. In this work, we present a new Bayesian hierarchical framework designed to meticulously decompose this observed tension into its constituent parts: standard measurement errors, information loss arising from parameter-space projection, and genuine physical tension. Our approach, employing Fisher matrix analysis with MCMC-estimated loss coefficients and explicitly modeling information loss via variance inflation factors ($\lambda$), is particularly important in high-precision analysis where even seemingly small information losses can impact conclusions. We find that the real tension component ($T_{real}$) has a mean value of 5.94 km/s/Mpc (95\% CI: [3.32, 8.64] km/s/Mpc). Quantitatively, approximately 78\% of the observed tension variance is attributed to real tension, 13\% to measurement error, and 9\% to information loss. Despite this, our decomposition indicates that the observed $\sim$$6.39\sigma$ discrepancy is predominantly a real physical phenomenon, with real tension contributing $\sim$$5.64\sigma$. Our findings strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is robust and probably points toward new physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model.",
New submissions,Testing the effect of progenitor's metallicity on $^{56}$Ni mass and constraining the progenitor scenarios in Type Ia supernovae,"Young-Lo Kim,Chul Chung,Yong -Cheol Kim",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The analytical model found that the intrinsic variation in the initial metallicity of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor stars ($Z_{progenitor}$) translates into a 25% variation in the $^{56}$Ni mass synthesized and, therefore, 0.2 mag difference in the observed peak luminosity of SNe Ia. Previous observational studies used the currently-observed global gas-phase metallicity of host galaxies, instead of $Z_{progenitor}$ used in the model, and showed a higher scatter in the $^{56}$Ni mass measurements compared to the model prediction. Here, we use $Z_{progenitor}$ of 34 normal SNe Ia and employ recent SN Ia explosion models with various configurations to cover the observed $^{56}$Ni mass range. Unlike previous studies, our sample covers the $Z_{progenitor}$ range, where most of the $Z_{progenitor}$ effect occurs. Linear regression returns a slope of 0.02+-0.03, which is the opposite trend to the analytical model, but at at low statistical significance level. We find that comparing our sample with SN Ia explosion models on the $Z_{progenitor}$--$^{56}$Ni mass diagram allows us to constrain the progenitor scenarios. We also explore other chemical composition indicators. For $(Fe/H)_{progenitor}$, our sample follows the trend predicted by the analytical models, but at a low significance level. Noticeably, $(\alpha/Fe)_{progenitor}$ shows the opposite trend and a clear gap. When we split the sample at $(\alpha/Fe)_{progenitor}$ = 0.35 $(\alpha/Fe)_{\odot}$, we find a 3$\sigma$ difference in the weighted-means of the $^{56}$Ni mass. Lastly, SNe Ia in different $Z_{progenitor}$ groups show a difference of 0.14+-0.09 mag in the standardized luminosity. The present work highlights a holistic approach (from the progenitor star to the explosion with SN Ia and host galaxy observational data) to understand the underlying physics of SNe Ia for more accurate and precise cosmology.",
New submissions,Reionization optical depth and CMB-BAO tension in punctuated inflation,Zhiqi Huang,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.",
New submissions,Binary Black Hole Phase Space Discovers the Signature of Pair Instability Supernovae Mass Gap,"Samsuzzaman Afroz,Suvodip Mukherjee",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The rapidly expanding catalog of gravitational-wave detections provides a powerful probe of the formation history of compact binaries across cosmic time. In this work, we extend the Binary Compact Object (BCO) phase-space framework to the full set of events in the GWTC-4 catalog to map the observed binary formation scenarios in a data-driven way. Applying this framework, we identify distinct regions of phase-space associated with different channels and discover for the first time a unique mass-cutoff scale in a data-driven way. The mapping of these on different formation channels reveals a population of first-generation (1G) black holes sharply truncated at approximately 45.5 $M_\odot$, consistent with the theoretically predicted pair-instability supernova (PISN) mass gap. These findings demonstrate the capability of the BCO phase-space to disentangle overlapping formation pathways, establish robust connections between gravitational-wave observations and binary evolution, and highlight the potential of upcoming observing runs to reveal rare populations and exotic origins.",
New submissions,Interacting k-essence field with non-pressureless Dark Matter: Cosmological Dynamics and Observational Constraints,"Saddam Hussain,Qiang Wu,Tao Zhu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a class of interacting dark energy and dark matter (DM) models, where dark energy is modeled as a $k$-essence scalar field with an inverse-square potential. Two general forms of interaction are considered: one proportional to the Hubble parameter, and another independent of the Hubble parameter, depending instead on combinations of the energy densities and pressures of the dark sectors. The dynamics are analyzed using a dynamical system stability framework by constructing an autonomous system of equations. The models are tested against a wide range of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), BAO measurements from DESI DR2, compressed Planck data (PLA), Pantheon+ (PP), DES supernovae, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and strong lensing data from H0LiCOW (HCW). The analysis shows that the models consistently reproduce all major cosmological epochs and yield statistically competitive results compared to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The models exhibit stable late-time de-Sitter solutions, ensuring ghost-free evolution, with the Hubble constant in the range $H_0 \sim 67$--$70$ km/s/Mpc.",
New submissions,Brans-Dicke-like field for co-varying $G$ and $c$: observational constraints,"J. Bezerra-Sobrinho,R. R. Cuzinatto,L. G. Medeiros,P. J. Pompeia",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Ref. [Symmetry 15 (2023) 709] introduced a Brans-Dicke-like framework wherein the scalar field $\phi$ is composed of both $G$ and $c$ which, for this reason, co-vary according to $c^{3}/G=\text{constant}$. In this paper, we use observational data to constrain the supposed co-varying $G$ and $c$. The datasets include SN Ia, BAO and the value of $\theta$ extracted from CMB data. A proxy function is demanded for the varying $c$ since the framework does not provide a closed set of equations for computing the functional form of either $G$ or $c$ uniquely. Accordingly, we choose three separate parameterizations for $c\left(z\right)$ inspired both by desirable properties of the varying speed of light (VSL) and by successful phenomenological models from the literature -- including the one by Gupta (CCC framework in e.g. Ref. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 498 (2020) 4481-4491]. When combined with DESI, Pantheon+ data strongly favor a variable speed of light with more than $3\sigma$ confidence level for all parameterizations considered in this paper, whereas Union2.1 suggests no variation of the speed of light. As we shall demonstrate, this apparent discrepancy is due to a strong correlation that emerges between $H_0$ and VSL.",
New submissions,Investigating the cosmic distance duality relation with gamma-ray bursts,"Anna Chiara Alfano,Carlo Cafaro,Salvatore Capozziello,Orlando Luongo,Marco Muccino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Deviations from the so-called {\it cosmic distance duality relation} may result from systematic errors in distance measurements or, more interestingly, hint at new physics. Further, it can also be related to the Hubble constant tension between early and local measurements of $H_0$. Based on this, we test validity of this relation through a model-independent parameterization of the Hubble rate via the well-estabilished Bézier polynomials approach. We seek for possible departures from the relation considering three parametrizations, i) a power-law correction, ii) a logarithmic correction and iii) a Padé series $P_{n,m}(z)$ of order (1;2) with $n=1$ being the order of the numerator while $m=2$ is the order of the denominator. Then, assuming a flat scenario, we test them through Monte Carlo -- Markov chain analyses that combine low- and intermediate/high-$z$ data sets, such as observational Hubble data, the Pantheon catalog of type Ia supernovae, galaxy clusters, the second data release from the DESI Collaboration and gamma-ray bursts. In particular, we distinguish between \emph{Analysis A} and \emph{Analysis C}, depending whether the prompt emission $E_{iso}-E_p$ or the prompt-afterglow $L_0-E_p-T$ gamma-ray burst correlations, respectively, is fit together with the other probes previously described. Our results seem to point towards a \emph{no violation} of the cosmic distance duality relation and a preference towards Planck's value of $H_0$.",
New submissions,The superMIGHTEE project: MeerKAT and GMRT Together to Unveil the Deep Radio Sky,"Dharam V.

The superMIGHTEE project combines data from the MIGHTEE project, using the precursor Square Kilometre Array (SKA) MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, with observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India to produce deep images at several $\mu$Jy sensitivity over a frequency range of 200 MHz--2.5 GHz, with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This paper describes the initial superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release, comprising total intensity continuum images covering a total of 9.9 deg$^2$ at 650 MHz and 6.9 deg$^2$ at 400 MHz in the XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS deep fields. The associated radio source catalogs include 27,101 sources at 650 MHz and 10,946 sources at 400 MHz. The redshift distribution of the sources extends to $z\sim4$ with a median value of $z=1$. An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with the MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral properties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated population to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities of a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population exhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy injection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten significantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with peaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release. Subsequent releases will include spectropolarimetric and spectral line image cubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE ultra-wideband dataset is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, (abridged).",
New submissions,Detection of colour variations from gravitational microlensing observations in the quadruple quasar HE0435-1223: Implications for the accretion disk,"Christian Sorgenfrei,Robert W. Schmidt,Joachim Wambsganss",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present monitoring observations of quasar microlensing in the quadruple quasar HE0435-1223. The microlensing-induced light curves of the quasar images are chromatic, i.e. they depend on the applied filter band. Comparison with microlensing simulations allows us to infer properties of the accretion disk. We determine the R and V band light curves of the four images of HE0435-1223 from 79 and 80 epochs respectively, taken from 2014 to 2024 at the Las Cumbres Observatory using difference imaging analysis. We consider difference light curves to remove the intrinsic quasar variability. This reveals a prominent long-term chromatic microlensing event in image B. We use microlensing light curve simulations with both Gaussian and standard thin accretion disk brightness profiles to analyse this signal. The particularly strong signal observed in image B of HE0435-1223 makes it possible to detect a size ratio of the accretion disk in the R band compared to the V band of $1.24^{+0.08}_{-0.20}$ and $1.42^{+0.11}_{-0.22}$ for the Gaussian and the thin disk model, respectively. These values are in agreement with standard thin disk theory. For the absolute size we find large disk half-light radii of around 0.7 to 1.0 Einstein radii with an uncertainty of about 0.6 dex (depending on the filter bands and the models). Finally, our calculations show that image B undergoes caustic crossings about once per year.",
New submissions,Quantum Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Cosmological Functions,"Giuseppe Sarracino,Vincenzo Fabrizio Cardone,Roberto Scaramella,Giuseppe Riccio,Andrea Bulgarelli,Carlo Burigana,Luca Cappelli,Stefano Cavuoti,Farida Farsian,Irene Graziotti,Massimo Meneghetti,Giuseppe Murante,Nicolò Parmiggiani,Alessandro Rizzo,Francesco Schillirò,Vincenzo Testa,Tiziana Trombetti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We present an implementation of Quantum Computing for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with an application to cosmological functions, to derive posterior distributions from cosmological probes. The algorithm proposes new steps in the parameter space via a quantum circuit whose resulting statevector provides the components of the shift vector. The proposed point is accepted or rejected via the classical Metropolis-Hastings acceptance method. The advantage of this hybrid quantum approach is that the step size and direction change in a way independent of the evolution of the chain, thus ideally avoiding the presence of local minima. The results are consistent with analyses performed with classical methods, both for a test function and real cosmological data. The final goal is to generalize this algorithm to test its application to complex cosmological computations.",
New submissions,Axion-Photon Conversion in FLRW with Primordial Magnetic Fields: Explaining the Radio Excess,"Setabuddin,Md Riajul Haque,Rajesh Karmakar,Supratik Pal",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We explore the possibility of axion-photon conversion as a common origin of two low-frequency anomalies: the isotropic radio excess (ARCADE2) and the deep global 21-cm absorption trough (EDGES). From the axion-photon action in an FLRW background with primordial magnetic fields (PMFs), we derive the scale-dependent conversion probability including plasma effects. Resonant conversion, arising when the axion mass matches the plasma-induced photon mass, produces soft photons in the MHz-GHz range. By modeling stochastic PMFs with amplitude $B_0$ and spectral index $n_{\rm B}$, we show that axion-like particles with mass $\sim 10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and nanogauss-level nearly scale invariant PMFs can explain both ARCADE2 and EDGES. Heating from PMF dissipation via ambipolar diffusion and turbulent decay reduces the 21-cm trough, shifting the viable parameter space. Our results stem from a consistent theoretical framework developed from first principles and a combined analysis of the radio excess and global 21-cm signal, while remaining consistent with CMB bounds on PMFs and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. We conclude that global 21-cm observations may offer potential sensitivity to axions, primordial magnetism, and dark-sector physics.",
New submissions,The simple way to measure evolving dark energy without prior-volume effects,"Maria Tsedrik,Pedro Carrilho,Chiara Moretti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a simple yet effective method to resolve prior-volume effects, also known as projection effects, in full-shape analyses of the power spectrum multipoles within the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). By re-defining the EFTofLSS nuisance parameters to incorporate the contribution from the parameters impacting the amplitude of the EFTofLSS modelling components, we substantially mitigate projection effects. With the re-parametrisation the actual posterior maximum values are within the marginalised credible interval, eliminating significant shifts observed in the baseline analysis. We demonstrate the robustness of this method in full-shape $w_0w_a$CDM analyses on synthetic data in BOSS DR12 and DESI DR1 setups. For the evolving dark energy model, we then analyse the BOSS DR12 measurements, in combination with BAO information (from BOSS DR12, 6DF, SDSS DR7 MGS and eBOSS DR16 surveys) and 3$\times$2pt measurements from DES Y3 -- all data combinations are converging into the $w_0-w_a$ parameter region preferred by DESI+CMB+SNIa. From total combination of these large-scale structure probes without additional CMB information we find $w_0=-0.72 \pm 0.21, \, w_a=-0.91^{+0.78}_{-0.64}$. Despite the low significance of deviation from standard cosmology, this result underscores the potential of our re-parametrisation approach in delivering low-redshift cosmological constraints. We argue for the use of this approach in spectroscopic Stage IV surveys, where the potential deviation from standard cosmology can be detected with higher significance.",
New submissions,Trispectrum in Extended USR Model with Transition to SR,"Hassan Firouzjahi,Amin Nassiri-Rad",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),We study the trispectrum in a two-phase USR-SR setup of inflation in which the USR stage is extended in the initial phase of inflation while the second stage of inflation proceeds via a slow-roll phase. A key role is played by the sharpness parameter which controls how quickly the system reaches the final attractor phase after the USR stage. We employ both $\delta N$ and in-in formalisms and calculate trispectrum and the corresponding dimensionless parameters $g_{NL}$ and $\tau_{NL}$. We show that both approaches yield the same results and study the shapes of trispectrum in various configurations. It is shown that the maximum value of trispectrum occurs in the setup with an infinitely sharp transition to the attractor phase while much of trispectrum is washed out in the opposite limit of a mild transition.,
New submissions,Constraints on Ultra-heavy DM from TeV-PeV gamma-ray diffuse measurements,"Manuel Rocamora,Pedro De La Torre Luque,Miguel A. Sánchez-Conde",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Recent experiments have measured the Galactic $\gamma$-ray diffuse emission up to PeV energies, opening a window to study acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays and their propagation up to the cosmic-ray knee. Furthermore, these observations provide a powerful tool to set strong constraints into very-heavy dark matter particles, with masses in the TeV-PeV range. In this paper, we explore the potential of the newest observations of diffuse emissions at the Galactic plane from HAWC and LHAASO to probe this kind of dark matter over a wide mass range. Here, we model secondary emissions (inverse-Compton) from the electrons and positrons produced in the annihilation/decay of dark matter, on top of their prompt $\gamma$-ray emission, including the effects of absorption of high-energy photons via pair production. Furthermore, we show that including the astrophysical backgrounds (namely diffuse emission from cosmic-ray collisions or emission from unresolved sources) can significantly improve these limits. We find that the new measurements provided, specially by LHAASO with the combination of the WCDA and KM2A detectors, allow us to set strong constraints in decaying dark matter, being competitive and even improving the strongest constraints at the moment. We also highlight that these regions lead to constraints that are less affected by uncertainties from the dark matter distribution and discuss how CTA north and SWGO will be able to improve limits in this mass range.",
New submissions,Environmental vs. intrinsic quenching at cosmic noon: Predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations for VLT-MOONRISE,"Paul H. Goubert,Asa F. L. Bluck,Joanna M. Piotrowska,Paul Torrey,Roberto Maiolino,Thomas Pinto Franco,Camilo Casimiro,Nicolas Cea",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present an investigation into the quenching of simulated galaxies across cosmic time, honing in on the role played by both intrinsic and environmental mechanisms at different epochs. In anticipation of VLT-MOONRISE, the first wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey to target cosmic noon, this work provides clear predictions to compare to the future observations. We investigate the quenching of centrals, high-mass satellites, and low-mass satellites from two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: IllustrisTNG and EAGLE. Satellites are split according to bespoke mass thresholds, designed to separate environmental and intrinsic quenching mechanisms. To determine the best parameter for predicting quiescence, we apply a Random Forest classification analysis for each galaxy class at each epoch. The Random Forest classification determines supermassive black hole mass as the best predictor of quiescence in centrals and high-mass satellites. Alternatively, the quenching of low-mass satellites is best predicted by group halo mass, at all epochs. Additionally, we investigate the evolution in the dependence of the quenched fraction with various parameters, revealing a more complex picture. There is strong evidence for the rejuvenation of star formation from z = 2 to z = 0 in EAGLE, but not in IllustrisTNG. The starkest discrepancy between simulations rests in the mass threshold analysis. While IllustrisTNG predicts the existence of environmentally quenched satellites visible within the survey limits of MOONRISE, EAGLE does not. Hence, MOONRISE will provide critical data that is needed to evaluate current models, and constrain future models, of quenching processes.",
New submissions,1.8 per cent measurement of $H_0$ from Cepheids alone,"Richard Stiskalek,Harry Desmond,Eleni Tsaprazi,Alan Heavens,Guilhem Lavaux,Stuart McAlpine,Jens Jasche",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"One of the most pressing problems in current cosmology is the cause of the Hubble tension. We revisit a two-rung distance ladder, composed only of Cepheid periods and magnitudes, anchor distances in the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 4258, and host galaxy redshifts. We adopt the SH0ES data for the most up-to-date and carefully vetted measurements, where the Cepheid hosts were selected to harbour also Type Ia supernovae. We introduce two important improvements: a rigorous selection modelling and a state-of-the-art density and peculiar velocity model using Manticore-Local, based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. We infer $H_0 = 71.7 \pm 1.3\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, assuming the Cepheid host sample was selected by estimated supernova magnitudes. Less plausible selection criteria shift $H_0$ by about one standard deviation. The posterior has a lower central value and a 45 per cent smaller error than a previous study using the same data. The result is also slightly lower than the supernova-based SH0ES inferred value of $H_0 = 73.2 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and is in $3.3\sigma$ tension with the latest standard cosmological model microwave background results. These results demonstrate that a measurement of $H_0$ of sufficient precision to weigh in on the Hubble tension is achievable using second-rung data alone, underscoring the importance of robust and accurate statistical modelling.",
New submissions,Cosmology inference with perturbative forward modeling at the field level: a comparison with joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses,"Kazuyuki Akitsu,Marko Simonović,Shi-Fan Chen,Giovanni Cabass,Matias Zaldarriaga",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We extend field-level inference to jointly constrain the cosmological parameters $\{A,\omega_{\rm cdm},H_0\}$, in both real and redshift space. Our analyses are based on mock data generated using a perturbative forward model, with noise drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a constant power spectrum. This idealized setting, where the field-level likelihood is exactly Gaussian, allows us to precisely quantify the information content in the nonlinear field on large scales. We find that field-level inference accurately recovers all cosmological parameters in both real and redshift space, with uncertainties consistent with perturbation theory expectations. We show that these error bars are comparable to those obtained from a joint power spectrum and bispectrum analysis using the same perturbative model. Finally, we perform several tests using the Gaussian field-level likelihood to fit the mock data where the true noise model is non-Gaussian, and find significant biases in the inferred cosmological parameters. These results highlight that the success of field-level inference critically depends on using the correct likelihood, which may be the primary challenge for applying this method to smaller scales even in the perturbative regime.",
New submissions,Cosmic $τ$ensions Indirectly Correlate with Reionization Optical Depth,"Itamar J. Allali,Lingfeng Li,Praniti Singh,JiJi Fan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The reionization optical depth $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has interesting connections to existing cosmological anomalies. As first studied in the context of the Hubble tension in our previous paper, a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$, which could be achieved by removing the Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data, could boost $H_0$ slightly, resulting in a mild reduction of the tension between the early- and late-universe determinations of $H_0$. It has been shown later that a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ could also relieve other anomalies including: the tension between BAO and CMB data, the neutrino mass tension, and the latest DESI plus supernovae data's tension with the standard cosmological constant scenario. In this paper, we systematically analyze the correlations between $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and relevant cosmological parameters in the existing cosmic observation anomalies. In addition to Pearson correlation coefficients extracted directly from the covariance matrix, we also study partial correlation coefficients which measure intrinsic relationships between pairs of parameters removing the influence of other parameters. We show that $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has weak intrinsic correlations with the parameters responsible for the tensions and anomalies discussed. The large direct Pearson correlations that allow larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ inferences to alleviate the cosmological tensions each arise from complicated networks through multiple parameters. As a result, the relationships between $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and each anomaly are not independent of each other. We also employ our method of computing correlations to clarify the impact of large scale polarization data, and comment also on the effects of CMB observations from ACT and SPT.",
Cross submissions,Inflation using a triplet of Antisymmetric tensor fields,"Abhijith Ajith,Sukanta Panda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study an inflation model driven by a triplet of antisymmetric tensor fields, with minimal and nonminimal couplings to gravity. First, we show that the presence of a triplet of antisymmetric tensor fields can provide inherent background isotropy in the stress-energy tensor contrary to the past studies using an antisymmetric tensor field. Inflation is supported in the presence of non-minimal couplings with gravity. We perform the slow roll analysis and also analyse perturbations to the antisymmetric tensor field as well as the tensor modes of perturbed metric. The speed of gravitational waves manifested from the tensor perturbations is tuned to $c$. We also study the evolution of the gravitational waves, calculate their power spectrum and tensor spectral index.",
Cross submissions,Scalar and vector modes in inflation with antisymmetric tensor field,"Abhijith Ajith,Sukanta Panda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the scalar and vector modes arising from cosmological perturbations within the framework of an inflationary scenario driven by an antisymmetric tensor field, minimally coupled to gravity. After eliminating gauge artifacts, there remain four scalar and six vector modes of interest which can be studied separately. We analyze the stability of these modes, while looking for generic instabilities like ghost and gradient instabilities that could potentially plague the theory. Further, we investigate the evolution of these modes across different regimes, particularly subhorizon and superhorizon scales.",
Cross submissions,Constraining Dark Photon Dark Matter with Radio Silence from Soliton Mergers around Supermassive Black Holes,"Dorian W. P. Amaral,Enrico D. Schiappacasse,Hong-Yi Zhang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We place the first constraints on the dark matter fraction contained within dark photon solitons using the absence of their predicted radio-frequency signatures, or radio silence, following mergers around supermassive black holes. In these dense environments, spiky dark matter density profiles can form that enhance the soliton merger rate. We present a novel estimate of this rate by incorporating both the steepened dark matter profile and the soliton velocity dispersion via the Jeans equation. For galaxies with an initial profile $\rho_\mathrm{DM} \propto r^{-1}$, we find the total merger rate across redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 4$ to be $\Gamma_{\text{merg}}^{\text{TOTAL}} \lesssim 10^{-7}f^2_{\text{DM}}\,\text{Mpc}^{-3}\,\text{day}^{-1}$, where $f_\mathrm{DM}$ is the solitonic fraction of dark matter. This enhanced rate leads to more major merger events in which the generated soliton has a mass exceeding a critical threshold, leading to its decay via the parametric resonance phenomenon that produces brief, narrowband, and energetic radio bursts detectable by fast radio burst surveys. Comparing our predictions with the non-observation of such events, we already obtain $f_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 10^{-1}$ from the first fast radio burst study. This constraint is strengthened to $f_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ from the Parkes HTRU survey, with CHIME projected to tighten this to $f_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 10^{-3}$. For larger $f_\mathrm{DM}$, we instead constrain the effective coupling strength between the dark and visible sectors to lie outside $10^{-18}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}} \lesssim g \lesssim 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-6}\,\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Our results establish astrophysical transients as powerful probes of dark sectors, opening a window onto the detectability of ultralight vector fields.",
Cross submissions,Higher-order gravity models: corrections up to cubic curvature invariants and inflation,"C. M. G. R. Morais,G. Rodrigues-da-Silva,L. G. Medeiros",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We construct a higher-order gravity model including all corrections up to mass dimension six. Starting from the Jordan frame, we derive the field equations and specialize to the FLRW background, where the dynamics take the form of a four-dimensional autonomous system. Focusing on the $R+R^{2}+RR_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ case, we obtain linearized equations in the parameter $\gamma_{0}$ and analyze the resulting phase space. The model exhibits the main desirable features of an inflationary regime, with a slow-roll attractor and a stable critical point corresponding to the end of inflation. Analytical expressions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ show that the model is consistent with Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data if $|\gamma_{0}|\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Moreover, negative values of $\gamma_{0}$ restore compatibility with recent ACT, Planck and DESI results, suggesting that higher-order corrections may play a relevant role in refining inflationary cosmology.",
Cross submissions,Cosmology in warped massive gravity,"Sebastian Garcia-Saenz,Yuxiang Wei,Xue Zhou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the cosmological dynamics and predictions in the theory of warped massive gravity. This set-up postulates a five-dimensional ghost-free massive graviton with a brane-localized four-dimensional massive gravity potential, and has the virtue of raising the strong-coupling scale of the 4D theory. We identify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale factor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary conditions for the Stückelberg fields and one characterized by a special tuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials. In the first case, we find interesting solutions including a cosmological bounce without the need of exotic matter. The second case leads to a modified Friedmann equation, and comparison with data shows the potential of the model to alleviate the Hubble tension.",
Cross submissions,Exploring Coupled Quintessence in light of CMB and DESI DR2 measurements,"Atul Ashutosh Samanta,Abhijith Ajith,Sukanta Panda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We perform a detailed analysis of a theoretically motivated dark energy quintessence model which interacts with the dark matter sector of the universe. Utilising the current observational datasets from the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Type Ia Supernovae, we constrain the parameters that characterise the strength of the time dependent interaction. We also look at the effect of a warm dark matter component in the context of coupled quintessence. Analysis using Deviance Information Criterion indicates strong preference for the quintessence model coupled with warm dark matter. However, Bayesian evidence analysis shows favor in the direction of $\Lambda$CDM model.",
Cross submissions,Ultralight Boson Ionization from Comparable-Mass Binary Black Holes,"Yuhao Guo,Zhen Zhong,Yifan Chen,Vitor Cardoso,Taishi Ikeda,Lihang Zhou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally bound states analogous to molecules once the binary separation decreases below the boson's Bohr radius, with the inner region co-moving with the binary. We simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions, demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.",
