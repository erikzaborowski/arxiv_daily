New submissions,Ly$α$ visibility from z = 4.5 to 11 in the UDS field: evidence for a high neutral hydrogen fraction and small ionized bubbles at z $\sim$ 7,"L. Napolitano,L. Pentericci,M. Dickinson,P. Arrabal Haro,A. J. Taylor,A. Calabrò,A. Bhagwat,P. Santini,F. Arevalo-Gonzalez,R. Begley,M. Castellano,B. Ciardi,C. T. Donnan,D. Dottorini,J. S. Dunlop,S. L. Finkelstein,A. Fontana,M.

Weiner",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The resonant scattering nature of Ly$\alpha$ photons interacting with neutral hydrogen makes Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) robust tracers of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction, and thus sensitive probes of cosmic reionization. We present an extensive study of the Ly$\alpha$ evolution from galaxies at 4.5 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 11 in the UDS field, observed as part of the CAPERS survey, and complemented with spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive. The combined sample includes 651 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\alpha$-break galaxies, among which we find 73 S/N>3 LAEs in JWST-NIRSpec PRISM spectra. We trace the redshift evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ emitter fraction with EW$_0$ >25 A (X$_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$) between z = 5 and z = 9, presenting the first such analysis in the UDS field. At z = 5 and 6, the UDS results agree with the average JWST X$_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ values from multiple fields. However, JWST measurements are consistently lower than ground-based results. To investigate this, we compare JWST observations to a population of star-forming galaxies at z$\sim$6 observed with VLT-FORS2. We find that a Ly$\alpha$ slit-loss of 35 $\pm$ 10% in JWST spectra accounts for the offset, as the resonant Ly$\alpha$ emission is more spatially extended than the stellar continuum. From z = 6 to 7, the UDS field shows a significant drop in Ly$\alpha$ visibility, from which we infer a neutral hydrogen fraction of X$_{\mathrm{HI}}$ = 0.7--0.9. Finally, we identify two robust ionized bubbles at z = 7.29 and 7.77, with radii of $R_{\mathrm{ion}}$ = 0.6 and 0.5 physical Mpc and photometric overdensities of N/$\langle$N$\rangle$ = 3 and 4, based on candidate counts down to the photometric completeness limit. Compared to the large ionized region at z$\sim$7 in the EGS field, these results indicate significant field-to-field variation, supporting a patchy, inhomogeneous reionization process.",
New submissions,Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram,"Nathan Steinle,Samar Safi-Harb",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways, providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time (i.e., Cosmic Accretion) or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.",
New submissions,CPL-parametrized cosmic expansion in Galileon gravity: Constraints from recent data,"Amit Samaddar,S. Surendra Singh",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore the cosmic expansion history within the framework of Galileon gravity by employing a redshift-based expression for the Hubble rate, $H(z)$, derived from the CPL parametrization $\omega_{DE}(z)=\omega_{0}+\omega_{a}\frac{z}{1+z}$. This parametrization allows for a time-dependent expansion history consistent with the non-linear Galileon field equations. To constrain the model parameters, we perform a MCMC analysis using $46$ Hubble parameter measurements, DESI DR2 BAO data and $1701$ Pantheon+ datasets. The best fit values obtained are $H_0 = 67.7043^{+1.4354}_{-1.4102}$ km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_{m0} = 0.2668^{+0.0212}_{-0.0217}$, $\omega_0 = -0.8827^{+0.1076}_{-0.0967}$ and $\omega_a = 0.0011^{+0.0660}_{-0.0622}$. Model comparison using information criteria yields $\Delta AIC=1.46$ and $\Delta BIC = 11.5$ indicating that the Galileon model is a strong contender to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The deceleration parameter shows a transition at $z_{tr} = 0.7873$, with $q_0 = -0.598$. Energy density and pressure remain physically viable with $\rho_{de}(z)>0$ and $p_{de}(z)<0$ with the present day equation of state $\omega(z)$ value of $-0.2915$, which suggests mild dynamical dark energy. NEC and DECare satisfied, while SEC is violated. The model yields $r_{0}=0.657$, $s_{0}=0.1173$ and Om diagnostic shows a peak value of $-0.45$ at $z = 0.377$, converging to $-1$ at latethis http URLresults demonstrate that Galileon gravity remains a viable and flexible alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing late-time cosmic acceleration.",
New submissions,Breaking the Baryon Density$\unicode{x2013}$Hubble Constant Degeneracy in Fast Radio Burst Applications with Associated Gravitational Waves,"Joscha N. Jahns-Schindler,Laura G. Spitler",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a unique probe of the cosmos, owing to dispersion caused by free electrons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Two of the main quantities of interest are degenerate: the density of matter $\Omega_\mathrm{b}f_\mathrm{d}$ outside of galaxies and the Hubble constant $H_0$. Here, we present a new possibility of breaking the degeneracy without invoking early Universe priors on $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. Assuming some FRBs originate in compact object mergers, the combination of dispersion and luminosity distance from the gravitational wave (GW) can be used to measure $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2f_\mathrm{d}$ (where $h$ is the dimensionless Hubble constant). We show that this measurement can be combined with the abundant FRBs that have a redshift measurement. This combination breaks the degeneracy with the Hubble constant. We develop a Bayesian framework and forecast that third-generation GW detectors are required to obtain meaningful constraints. We forecast that one year of Einstein Telescope operations can constrain $H_0$ to $\pm 6\,\mathrm{km}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2f_\mathrm{d}$ to $^{+0.0015}_{-0.0016}$ (68$\,\%$ credible interval). The method can also be used with luminosity distances obtained through other means than GWs.",
New submissions,Reconstruction of X-Ray Afterglow Light Curves of GRBs and its implication for constraining Cosmological Parameters,"Yu-Qi Zhou,Shuang-Xi Yi,Yu-Peng Yang,Jia-Lun Li,Jian-Ping Hu,Yan-Kun Qu,Fa-Yin Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as important cosmological probes, whose X-ray afterglow light curves (LCs) may exhibit a plateau phase (with temporal slope $\alpha$ between 0 and 0.5) that may originate from magnetar energy injection. Similar to Type Ia Supernovae, GRBs with a common physical origin can be used as standardizable candles for cosmological studies. However, observational gaps in GRB light curves introduce significant uncertainties in plateau parameter estimation, thereby affecting cosmological constraints. In this work, we employ a stochastic reconstruction technique to reconstruct the X-ray afterglow LCs for 35 GRB samples exhibiting plateau features, generating 50 simulated data points for each LC. Using the reconstructed LCs, we calibrate three luminosity correlations: the $L_0$-$t_b$, $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$, and $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso}}$ relation, which are then applied to constrain both flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models. The main results include: (i) the $L_0$-$t_b$ relation yields a slope $b \approx -1$, supporting a constant magnetar energy injection rate; (ii) light curve reconstruction has limited impact on cosmological parameter constraints; (iii) for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\Omega_m$ improves by 6.25\%; For the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\Omega_\Lambda$ improves by 1.01\%. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of LC data points provides limited improvement to cosmological constraints, while expanding the sample size of GRBs with identical physical origins may be more crucial.",
New submissions,"Anisotropic Neutrino Emission from Spinning, Moving, and Charged Primordial Black Holes",Arnab Chaudhuri,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The angular and spectral features of neutrinos emitted from primordial black holes (PBHs) carry key imprints of the black hole's fundamental properties. This work investigates the directional emission of neutrinos from Kerr-Newman PBHs undergoing Hawking evaporation, accounting for the combined effects of spin, motion, and electric charge. Rotation induces anisotropic fluxes through axisymmetric geometry and spin-dependent greybody factors, while relativistic motion leads to pronounced Doppler beaming along the direction of travel. Electric charge modifies the thermodynamic evolution and suppresses the emission of like-charged particles, altering the overall spectrum and burst duration. The resulting neutrino flux exhibits rich angular structure, energy dependence, and time profiles that vary with PBH parameters. These directional signatures enhance the prospects for detection at current and future neutrino observatories, and offer new multi-messenger probes of PBH populations in the early universe.",
New submissions,Resurrecting Vanilla Power Law Inflation with the aid of Continuous Spontaneous Localization in the ACT era,Suratna Das,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"The Vanilla Power Law Inflation is plagued with two severe drawbacks, the one being the issue of graceful exit, and the other being its compatibility with the existing data. There's yet another daunting problem generic to any inflationary model, and not particular to the Power Law Inflation, is the issue of classicalization of the primordial quantum perturbation. This issue is often treated as an isolated problem primarily because decoherence is often invoked to tackle such problems and decoherence, in principle, doesn't leaves any observational imprints. However, that's not the case if one invokes the collapse models of quantum mechanics to resolve such a problem, because the collapse models do modify the Schrödinger evolution of the quantum system and the modified dynamics is bound to leave imprints. We show that collapsed modified Power Law Inflation can indeed circumvent the issue with observations and can be made compatible with all the current data coming from {\it Planck}, {\it ACT}, DESI and BAO while resolving the classicalization issue associated with the quantum primordial fluctuations. Such an inflationary model also produces a more red-tilted tensor spectrum and no running for both the scalar and tensor spectral indices, which can be a litmus test for this model.",
New submissions,Enhancement of first-order phase transitions through a mass-acquiring scalar field,"Yuan-Jie Li,Jing Liu,Zong-Kuan Guo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Phase transitions in the early Universe give rise to effective masses for massless fields in the symmetry-broken phase. We use the lattice simulations to investigate the impact of a spectator scalar field with mass generation on the dynamics of first-order phase transitions and the generation of gravitational waves. In addition to the well-known friction effects, we identify a novel effect that significantly enhances the strength of first-order phase transitions. The amplitude of the mass-acquiring field is highly suppressed in the true vacuum bubbles, resulting in additional release of vacuum energy that concentrate on the bubble walls. We also establish an analytical method to explain our numerical results.",
New submissions,Growth Index in the $γδ$CDM model,"Cemsinan Deliduman,Furkan Şakir Dilsiz,Selinay Sude Binici",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"To better distinguish the nature of $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, it is necessary to separate the effects of expansion and the growth of structure. The growth index $\gamma$ was identified as the single parameter that characterizes the growth of density fluctuations independently of the effects of cosmic expansion. Analyses performed with various cosmological datasets indicate that the growth index has to be larger than its theoretically predicted value in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Cosmological models based on $f(R)$ gravity theories have scale-dependent growth indices, whose values are even more at odds with the growth rate data. In this work, we evaluate the growth index in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model both theoretically and numerically. Although based on $f(R)$ gravity theory, we show through several analyses with different combinations of datasets that the growth index and growth rate in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model behave similarly to the $\Lambda$CDM and the $\omega$CDM models. When faced with cosmological data, we also demonstrate that the $\gamma\delta$CDM model fits better than the $\Lambda$CDM and the $\omega$CDM models.",
Cross submissions,Inflationary Slow-Roll Parameters in the Jordan Frame for Cosmological F(R) Gravity Models,Vsevolod R. Ivanov,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"$F(R)$ inflationary models are analyzed without the Weyl transformation to the Einstein frame. Sufficient conditions for existence of global inflationary attractors in $F(R)$ models are provided. Following that, the procedure for calculating inflationary observables completely in the original, Jordan, frame is given. The described procedure is used to analyze a new $F(R)$ inflationary model (a one-parameter deformation of the Starobinsky model), which is shown to provide predictions in good agreement with the recent ACT data.",
Cross submissions,Identifying Monochromatic Signals in LISA and Taiji via Spectral Split: Gravitational Waves versus Ultralight Dark Matter,"Yue-Hui Yao,Tingyuan Jiang,Wenyan Ren,Di Chen,Yong Tang,Yu-Feng Zhou",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to explore the dark Universe. Ultralight dark matter (ULDM), an attractive candidate for dark matter, might induce monochromatic signals in gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers. However it is not clear how such signals are disentangled from the GWs emitted by galactic compact binaries. Here we initiate the investigation on the spectral split of monochromatic signals caused by detector's heliocentric motion in space and show the annual modulation can induce distinct structures in the spectral harmonics for GWs and ULDM, which would enable to clearly identify the nature of the signal. We show the physical parameters can be inferred with high precision using the Fisher matrix formalism. Our results provide a practical algorithm for probing ULDM and broaden the scientific objectives of future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.",
Cross submissions,Scrutinizing Fermionic Dark Matter in Scotogenic Model with Low Reheating Temperature,"Abhishek Roy,Rameswar Sahu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The scotogenic model provides a minimal and elegant framework that simultaneously explains neutrino masses and accommodates a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic DM in the scotogenic model, with a particular emphasis on the effects of a non-standard cosmological history characterized by a low reheating temperature. We demonstrate that entropy injection from inflaton decay can significantly dilute the DM abundance, thereby relaxing the annihilation cross section required to reproduce the observed relic density and opening new regions of viable parameter space. We further analyze the complementarity between current and future direct detection experiments and charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV) searches in probing this scenario. Our results show that next-generation direct detection experiments such as DARWIN and XLZD, together with upcoming cLFV searches (in particular the future sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ experiments), will be capable of testing substantial regions of the parameter space, including those associated with low reheating temperatures.",
