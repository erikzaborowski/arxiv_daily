New submissions,Impact of redshift distribution uncertainties on Lyman-break galaxy cosmological parameter inference,"Francesco Petri,Boris Leistedt,Daniel J. Mortlock,Joel Leja,Stephen Thorp,Justin Alsing,Hiranya V. Peiris,Sinan Deger",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A significant number of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) with redshifts 3 < z < 5 are expected to be observed by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This will enable us to probe the universe at higher redshifts than is currently possible with cosmological galaxy clustering and weak lensing surveys. However, accurate inference of cosmological parameters requires precise knowledge of the redshift distributions of selected galaxies, where the number of faint objects expected from LSST alone will make spectroscopic based methods of determining these distributions extremely challenging. To overcome this difficulty, it may be possible to leverage the information in the large volume of photometric data alone to precisely infer these distributions. This could be facilitated using forward models, where in this paper we use stellar population synthesis (SPS) to estimate uncertainties on LBG redshift distributions for a 10 year LSST (LSSTY10) survey. We characterise some of the modelling uncertainties inherent to SPS by introducing a flexible parameterisation of the galaxy population prior, informed by observations of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and cosmic star formation density (CSFRD). These uncertainties are subsequently marginalised over and propagated to cosmological constraints in a Fisher forecast. Assuming a known dust attenuation model for LBGs, we forecast constraints on the sigma8 parameter comparable to Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints.",
New submissions,Primordial black holes with mass ratio-modulated initial clustering: merger suppression and projected constraints,Gabriel Luis Dizon,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a modification of the expected local primordial black hole (PBH) count $N(y)$, typically seen in the context of the early PBH binary merger rate as a term in the merger rate suppression. We utilize recent results in small-scale PBH clustering to formulate $N(y)$ in such a way that accounts for variations in the binary mass ratio $q$. We then examine how this change affects the projected constraints on PBH abundance from simulated Einstein Telescope (ET) and LISA mergers. Our results indicate that for broadly extended mass distributions, the merger suppression is greatly reduced for binaries with $q \gg 1$. This leads to an enhanced merger rate for binary distributions favoring a lighter average mass. This change is best reflected in the constraints derived from the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), as the increased merger rate does not have as much of an impact on constraints from resolvable mergers. Our results imply that the assumption of PBH clustering is testable at abundances and mass ranges much lower than anticipated, but only definitively through measurements of the SGWB.",
New submissions,Indicator Functions: Distilling the Information from Gaussian Random Fields,"Andrew Repp,Ravi K. Sheth,Istvan Szapudi,Yan-Chuan Cai",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A random Gaussian density field contains a fixed amount of Fisher information on the amplitude of its power spectrum. For a given smoothing scale, however, that information is not evenly distributed throughout the smoothed field. We investigate which parts of the field contain the most information by smoothing and splitting the field into different levels of density (using the formalism of indicator functions), deriving analytic expressions for the information content of each density bin in the joint-probability distribution (given a distance separation). We find that the information peaks at moderately rare densities (where the number of smoothed survey cells $N\sim 100$). Counter-intuitively, we find that, for a finite survey volume, indicator function analysis can outperform conventional two-point statistics while using only a fraction of the total survey cells, and we explain why. In light of recent developments in marked statistics (such as the indicator power spectrum and density-split clustering), this result elucidates how to optimize sampling for effective extraction of cosmological information.",
New submissions,The $α$-Attractor E-Model in Warm Inflation: Observational Viability from Planck 2018,"Bhargabi Saha,Malay K. Nandy",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We explore the inflationary evolution and observational viability of the $\alpha$-attractor E-model in the framework of warm inflation, focusing on both weak and strong dissipative regimes, with a dissipation coefficient linear in temperature. In the strong regime, we account for the growth of inflaton fluctuations due to coupling with the radiation bath via two different forms for the dissipation enhancement function: one associated with plateau-like potentials, and another motivated by the warm little inflation scenario. Employing slow roll conditions, we analytically derive the expressions for the key inflationary observables, the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in both dissipative regimes. The resulting theoretical trajectories on the $n_s$--$r$ plane are then juxtaposed with the contour plots obtained from Planck 2018 data in order to constrain the model parameter. Our analysis shows that the warm $\alpha$-attractor E-model remains compatible with observations in both dissipative regimes, with dissipation playing a crucial role in shifting the predictions and enlarging the viable parameter space, highlighting observational robustness of the model when extended to warm inflation.",
New submissions,Primordial Black Holes Save $R^2$ Inflation,"Kazunori Kohri,Xinpeng Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In light of the latest Planck-Atacama Cosmology Telescope (P-ACT) joint results on the primordial scalar power spectrum, we show that the $R^2$ inflation model extended with a non-minimally coupled scalar field $\chi$--namely the $R^2$-Higgs model--can yield a larger spectral index $n_s$ and a small positive running $\alpha_s$ at cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales, which are consistent with the data. This is because the $\chi$ field contributes a blue-tilted component to the primordial power spectrum which both modifies the large-scale power and, as a result, significantly enhances power on small scales. The consequent enhancement be large enough to lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $\lesssim 10^{20}\mathrm{g}$, accounting for all of the dark matter. Furthermore, future observations of the small-scale power spectrum, CMB spectral distortions, and stochastic gravitational waves will provide decisive tests of this model and its predictions for PBHs.",
New submissions,Quantum cosmological perturbations in bouncing models with mimetic dark matter,"Idaiane L. Machado,Dêivid R. da Silva,Nelson Pinto-Neto",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We calculate the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations originated from quantum vacuum fluctuations in bouncing scenarios proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology} in the framework of mimetic cosmology. We show that all physically relevant models produce scale invariant spectral indices, and amplitudes compatible with observations provided that the bounce occurs at length scales $t_0$ inside the physically reasonable interval $10^5 l_p < t_0 < 10^9 l_p$. We also show that by slightly modifying the scalar field potential proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology}, we can also obtain the observed red-tilted spectral index, with the same amplitude constraints. Hence, mimetic cosmology provides reasonable bouncing cosmological models without the need of any background quantum effect.",
New submissions,Separating Angular and Radial Modes with Spherical-Fourier Bessel Power Spectrum on All Scales and Implications for Systematics Mitigation,"Robin Y. Wen,Henry S. Grasshorn Gebhardt,Chen Heinrich,Olivier Doré",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys place stringent requirements on the mitigation of observational systematics in order to achieve their unprecedented constraining power. In this work, we investigate the potential use of the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power spectrum in controlling systematics, leveraging its capability of disentangling angular and radial scales. We first clarify how the discrete SFB basis describes radial scales via the index $n$ and demonstrate that the SFB power spectrum reduces to the clustering wedge $P(k,\mu)$ in the plane-parallel limit, enabling it to inherit results from past literature based on the clustering wedge. Crucially, the separation of angular and radial scales allows systematics to be localized in SFB space. In particular, systematics with broad and smooth radial distributions primarily concentrate in the $n=0$ modes corresponding to the largest radial scales. This localization behavior enables one to selectively remove only particular angular and radial modes contaminated by systematics. This is in contrast to standard 3D clustering analyses based on power spectrum multipoles, where systematic effects necessitate the removal of all modes below a given $k_{\rm min}$. Our findings advocate for adopting the SFB basis in 3D clustering analyses where systematics have become a limiting factor.",
New submissions,Renormalized Perturbation Theory at Field-level: the LSS bootstrap in GridSPT,"Matteo Peron,Takahiro Nishimichi,Massimo Pietroni,Atsushi Taruya",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a first step toward field-level cosmological inference beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, focusing on optimizing precision tests in the nonlinear regime of large-scale structure (LSS). As an illustrative case, we study the model-independent ``bootstrap'' coefficient of the second-order perturbation theory (PT) kernel for matter in real space, which we use as a proxy for new physics effects in the nonlinear sector. We discuss in details the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff dependence induced by discretizing fields on a grid, which requires proper renormalization to eliminate grid artifacts. We formulate a Wilsonian perturbative framework in which the evolution from a UV theory defined at a high cutoff $\Lambda_\text{uv}$ down to lower cutoffs is computed analytically, even beyond the validity of a derivative expansion. Within this framework, we develop an extended version of the GridSPT code incorporating the bootstrap parameterization and demonstrate how cutoff-independent predictions can be achieved through the inclusion of appropriate counterterms. We validate our approach at third- and fifth-order in PT, emphasizing the importance of higher-derivative contributions for unbiased parameter extraction. Our framework is readily extendable to biased tracers and redshift-space distortions.",
New submissions,Constraining Dark Matter Parameters in the Lambda-CDM Framework: A Bayesian Comparison of Planck and DES Constraints,"Manjeet Kunwar,Nabin Bhusal,Manil Khatiwada,Niraj Dhital",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a Bayesian analysis of cosmological parameter constraints from early- and late-universe observations, focusing on the matter density parameter ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Using data from the Planck 2018 satellite mission and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3, we compute theoretical predictions for angular and matter power spectra via Boltzmann solvers and perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling using the \texttt{emcee} Python package. Our key contribution is a direct and quantitative comparison of DES and Planck constraints, assessing their consistency using chi-squared analysis and Gaussian tension metrics. We find a statistically significant $6.46\sigma$ tension in $\Omega_m$ and a $2.68\sigma$ tension in $\sigma_8$ between the two datasets. These results provide fresh evidence of persistent discrepancies in cosmological parameter estimates and suggest that simple extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM model may be insufficient to fully reconcile early- and late-time observations, motivating the need for more complex theoretical models or refined treatment of systematics.",
New submissions,Galaxy Cluster Mass Estimation Through The Splashback Radius,"Lucas Gabriel-Silva,Laerte Sodré Jr",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present an analysis of the splashback radius ($R_{\text{sp}}$) and the associated splashback mass ($M_{\text{sp}}$) for a sample of galaxy clusters using SDSS spectroscopic data and mock simulations. $R_{\text{sp}}$ marks a physical boundary between the virialized core and the outer infall regions of clusters, providing a robust measure of cluster mass accretion history without being affected by pseudo-evolution. We model the cumulative galaxy number profile of clusters, testing different halo density models and considering the impact of cluster properties, such as center definitions, magnitude limits, galaxy colors, and field contamination, on the estimation of splashback features. Our results show that observed splashback radii, measured in projection (2D), are consistently smaller than predicted by dark matter simulations, with $R_\text{sp}/R_{200m} \approx 1$, supporting previous discrepancies in the literature. We also explore the relationship between $M_{\text{sp}}$ and $R_{\text{sp}}$, proposing a new scaling relation for future cosmological studies, as $R_{\text{sp}}$ is easily observable. Our findings indicate that splashback masses strongly correlate with radii, with a dispersion of $\approx 0.15$ dex, competitive with other mass-observable relations. However, the fitted relation diverges from the constant density expectations of galaxy clusters around $R_\text{sp}$. Additionally, the $M_{\text{sp}} \textendash R_{\text{sp}}$ relation shows significant redshift evolution, though the predominantly low-redshift range of our sample limits our ability to confirm this trend conclusively. The approach developed here may play a key role in cluster characterization and cosmology in the era of large galaxy surveys.",
New submissions,Constraints on cosmology and baryonic feedback with joint analysis of Dark Energy Survey Year 3 lensing data and ACT DR6 thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations,"S. Pandey,J.

Yanny",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present a joint analysis of weak gravitational lensing (shear) data obtained from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect measurements from a combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck data. A combined analysis of shear (which traces the projected mass) with the tSZ effect (which traces the projected gas pressure) can jointly probe both the distribution of matter and the thermodynamic state of the gas, accounting for the correlated effects of baryonic feedback on both observables. We detect the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation at a 21$\sigma$ significance, the highest to date, after minimizing the bias from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ map. By jointly modeling the small-scale shear auto-correlation and the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation, we obtain $S_8 = 0.811^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.263^{+0.023}_{-0.030}$, results consistent with primary CMB analyses from Planck and P-ACT. We find evidence for reduced thermal gas pressure in dark matter halos with masses $M < 10^{14} \, M_{\odot}/h$, supporting predictions of enhanced feedback from active galactic nuclei on gas thermodynamics. A comparison of the inferred matter power suppression reveals a $2-4\sigma$ tension with hydrodynamical simulations that implement mild baryonic feedback, as our constraints prefer a stronger suppression. Finally, we investigate biases from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ-shear cross-correlation measurements, employing mitigation techniques to ensure a robust inference. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.",
New submissions,Multi-band observation of lensed gravitational waves as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos,"Katsuya T. Abe,Shun Arai,Ryoto Inui,Hirotaka Yarimoto,Takahiro S. Yamamoto,Shuichiro Yokoyama",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The gravitational lensing effect of gravitational waves (GWs) has been extensively discussed as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos, which can provide missing information about dark matter. We propose a multi-band observation of lensed GWs from a compact binary to observe both geometrical optics (GO) and wave optics (WO) effects from the same source. This method is expected to be advantageous in breaking parameter degeneracies between a GW source and a dark matter halo acting as a lens. We assume DECIGO or B-DECIGO as a space-based detector observing the early inspiral phase, and the ET as a ground-based detector observing the merger phase. We perform a Fisher analysis of multi-band detection for a source with masses $m_1 = 30 M_{\odot}, m_2 = 20 M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.5$, and a lens with mass $3 \times 10^{3} M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.0$. With this setup, the GO effect appears in the ET frequency band, and the WO effect in that of DECIGO. For the halo density profile, we adopt Singular Isothermal Sphere, Cored Isothermal Sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White models. We find that multi-band observation resolves parameter degeneracies and significantly reduces errors in estimated parameters. For the CIS model, in particular, we show that, by combining ET and DECIGO observations, the lens mass error improves by about 71 $\%$ and 58 $\%$ compared to ET and DECIGO alone, respectively. Similarly, the impact parameter error is reduced by about 65 $\%$ and 70 $\%$, and the core size error by 34 $\%$ and 68 $\%$, respectively. From these results, we conclude that the multi-band observation of GWs from compact binaries improves the estimation of the lens object properties by breaking the parameter degeneracy.",
New submissions,Power Spectrum Emulators from Neural Networks and Tree-Based Methods,Andrei Lazanu,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We use two subsets of 2000 and 1000 \textsc{Quijote} simulations to build two power spectrum emulators, allowing for fast computations of the non-linear matter power spectrum. The first emulator works on scales $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ in terms of seven cosmological parameters: the matter and baryon fraction of the energy density of the Universe $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the amplitude of matter density fluctuations $\sigma_8$, the total neutrino mass $M_{\nu}$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. The power spectra can be directly determined at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, while for intermediate redshifts these can be interpolated. The second emulator is based on five cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$ and the amplitude of equilateral non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equilateral}$, at redshifts 0, 0.503, 0.733, 0.997 for $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$. The emulators are built on machine learning techniques. In both cases we have investigated both neural networks and tree-based methods and we have shown that the best accuracy is obtained for a neural network with two hidden layers. Both emulators achieve a root-mean-squared relative error of less then 5\% for all the redshifts considered on the scales discussed.",
New submissions,Non-Separable Halo Bias from High-Redshift Galaxy Clustering,"Emy Mons,Vipul Prasad Maranchery,M. S. Suryan Sivadas,Charles Jose",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The halo model provides a powerful framework for interpreting galaxy clustering by linking the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes to the underlying matter distribution. A key assumption within the linear bias approximation of the halo model is that the halo bias between two halo populations is a separable function of the mass of each population. In this work, we test the validity of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales using both simulations and observational data. Unlike previous studies, we explicitly disentangle the effects of scale dependence of the bias to assess the robustness of bias separability across a broad range of halo masses and redshifts. In particular, we define a separability function based on halo or galaxy cross-correlations to quantify deviations from halo bias separability, and measure it from N-body simulations. We find significant departures from separability on quasi-linear scales ($\sim$ 1-5 Mpc) at high redshifts ($z \geq 3$), leading to enhancements in halo cross-correlations by up to a factor of 2 -- or even higher. In contrast, deviations at low redshifts remain modest. Additionally, using high-redshift ($z \sim 3.6$) galaxy samples, we detect deviations from bias separability that closely align with simulation predictions. The breakdown of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales at high redshifts underscore the importance to account for non-separability in models of the galaxy-halo connection in this regime. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of high-redshift galaxy cross-correlations as a probe for improving the galaxy-halo connection from upcoming large-scale surveys.",
New submissions,CMB line-of-sight integrators for nearly-isotropic cosmological models,"João G. Vicente,Thiago S. Pereira,Cyril Pitrou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Homogeneous and nearly-isotropic cosmological models are natural extensions of standard Friedmann cosmologies. Constraining their features is crucial, as any detection of their properties would impact our understanding of inflation and the cosmological principle. Since these models evolve as a set of non-interacting scalar, vector, and tensor modes on top of homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, their imprints on cosmological observables, particularly the CMB, can be obtained using standard line-of-sight methods. This requires (1) that one resorts on Laplacian eigenmodes on spatially curved spaces and (2) that radial functions for these modes are analytically continued to accommodate complex (i.e., supercurvature) wavenumbers. We introduce two line-of-sight integrators implementing the evolution of the CMB anisotropies in these models: \texttt{AniLoS}, a user-friendly and easy to modify \texttt{Python} package, and \texttt{AniCLASS}, an advanced and efficient extension of the Boltzmann solver \texttt{CLASS}. We discuss possible initial conditions that could generate such fluctuations and provide illustrative examples using our codes. This work offers a pathway for leveraging diverse cosmological datasets to constrain superhorizon anisotropies of the late-time universe.",
New submissions,"Not so dark, not so dense: an alternative explanation for the lensing subhalo in SDSSJ0946+1006","Qiuhan He,Andrew Robertson,James W. Nightingale,Aristeidis Amvrosiadis,Shaun Cole,Carlos S. Frenk,Samuel C. Lange,Shubo Li,Ran Li,Xiaoyue Cao,Leo W.H. Fung,Xianghao Ma,Richard Massey,Kaihao Wang,Maximilian von Wietersheim-Kramsta",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Previous studies of the strong lens system SDSSJ0946+1006 have reported a dark matter subhalo with an unusually high central density, potentially challenging the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. However, these analyses assumed the subhalo to be completely dark, neglecting the possibility that it may host a faint galaxy. In this work, we revisit the lensing analysis of SDSSJ0946+1006, explicitly modelling the subhalo as a luminous satellite. Incorporating light from the perturber broadens the range of allowed subhalo properties, revealing solutions with significantly lower central densities that are consistent with CDM expectations. The inferred luminosity of the satellite also aligns with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. While high-concentration subhaloes remain allowed, they are no longer statistically preferred. The luminous subhalo model yields a better fit to the data, while also offering a more plausible explanation that is in line with theoretical expectations. We validate our methodology using mock data, demonstrating that neglecting subhalo light can lead to inferred mass distributions that are artificially compact.",
New submissions,Resonant neutrino self-interactions: insights from the full shape galaxy power spectrum,"Hernán E. Noriega,Josue De-Santiago,Gabriela Garcia-Arroyo,Jorge Venzor,Abdel Pérez-Lorenzana",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"This paper investigates resonant neutrino self-interactions in cosmology by employing, for the first time, the effective field theory of large-scale structure to model their impact on the matter distribution up to mildly nonlinear scales. We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g_\nu< 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\nu < 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$ confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.",
Cross submissions,Freeze-in production of scalaron dark matter in $f(R)$ gravity,"Basabendu Barman,Ashmita Das,Rakesh Kumar SivaKumar,Rudra Pratap Udgata",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We demonstrate that the scalaron, a scalar degree of freedom, emerging from the $f(R)$ theory of gravity, can account for the observed dark matter (DM) abundance if its mass is around the MeV scale, to ensure its cosmological stability. Focusing on two well-known $f(R)$ gravity models, we systematically show that if scalaron production proceeds via the freeze-in mechanism, the right relic abundance is satisfied over a very narrow window of reheating temperature $10^{14}\lesssim T_{\rm rh}\lesssim 10^{16}$ GeV. We delineate the viable parameter space of the $f(R)$ models consistent with the observed DM abundance, and highlight relevant experimental constraints from searches targeting DM decay signatures.",
Cross submissions,Composite Hybrid Inflation : Primordial Black Holes and Stochastic Gravitational Waves,"Giacomo Cacciapaglia,Dhong Yeon Cheong,Aldo Deandrea,Wanda Isnard,Seong Chan Park,Xinpeng Wang,Ying-li Zhang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the production of primordial black holes and gravitational waves in composite hybrid inflation. Starting from an effective chiral Lagrangian with a dilaton and pions, we identify inflation occurring due to the walking dynamics of the theory. A $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-breaking term in the pion sector induces a shift in the inflaton's trajectory, which leads to a tachyonic instability phase. Curvature perturbations grow exponentially, producing copious primordial black holes and a stochastic gravitational wave background. We show that the primordial black hole mass and the gravitational wave frequency are strongly restricted by the anomalous dimensions of the pion operators, with larger anomalous dimensions giving lighter primordial black holes and higher frequency gravitational waves. In both cases, the associated signatures lie within reach of future gravitational wave observatories.",
Cross submissions,Teaching Astronomy with Large Language Models,"Yuan-Sen Ting,Teaghan O'Briain",Physics Education (physics.ed-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"We present a study of LLM integration in final-year undergraduate astronomy education, examining how students develop AI literacy through structured guidance and documentation requirements. We developed AstroTutor, a domain-specific astronomy tutoring system enhanced with curated arXiv content, and deployed it alongside general-purpose LLMs in the course. Students documented their AI usage through homework reflections and post-course surveys. We analyzed student evolution in AI interaction strategies and conducted experimental comparisons of LLM-assisted versus traditional grading methods. LLM grading showed strong correlation with human evaluation while providing more detailed and consistent feedback. We also piloted LLM-facilitated interview-based examinations as a scalable alternative to traditional assessments, demonstrating potential for individualized evaluation that addresses common testing limitations. Students experienced decreased rather than increased reliance on LLMs over the semester, developing critical evaluation skills and strategic tool selection. They evolved from basic assistance-seeking to verification workflows, with documentation requirements fostering metacognitive awareness. Students developed effective prompting strategies, contextual enrichment techniques, and cross-verification practices. Our findings suggest that structured LLM integration with transparency requirements and domain-specific tools can enhance astronomy education while building essential AI literacy skills. We provide implementation guidelines for educators and make our AstroTutor repository freely available.",
Cross submissions,Spatial Correlation between Pulsars from Interfering Gravitational-Wave Sources in Massive Gravity,"Yu-Mei Wu,Yan-Chen Bi,Qing-Guo Huang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In the nanohertz band, the spatial correlations in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) produced by interfering gravitational waves (GWs) from multiple sources likely deviate from the traditional ones without interference under the assumption of an isotropic Gaussian ensemble. This work investigates the impact of such interference within the framework of massive gravity. Through simulations, we show that while the resulting correlation patterns can be described by Legendre expansions with coefficients that depend on the interference configuration, they remain predominantly quadrupolar (l = 2), with this feature becoming more pronounced as the graviton mass increases--reflecting both the tensorial polarizations and the modified GW dispersion. However, the interference introduces significant variability in the angular correlation, making it difficult to distinguish massive gravity from general relativity based on a single realization of the Universe. We conclude that beyond a fundamental constraint set by the PTA observation time, achieving a substantially tighter bound on the graviton mass is statistically challenging and observationally limited under realistic conditions.",
