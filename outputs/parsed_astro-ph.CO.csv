New submissions,LIMFAST. IV. Learning High-Redshift Galaxy Formation from Multiline Intensity Mapping with Implicit Likelihood Inference,"Guochao Sun,Tri Nguyen,Claude-André Faucher-Giguère,Adam Lidz,Tjitske Starkenburg,Bryan R. Scott,Tzu-Ching Chang,Steven R. Furlanetto",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"By opening up new avenues to statistically constrain astrophysics and cosmology with large-scale structure observations, the line intensity mapping (LIM) technique calls for novel tools for efficient forward modeling and inference. Implicit likelihood inference (ILI) from semi-numerical simulations provides a powerful setup for investigating a large model parameter space in a data-driven manner, therefore gaining significant recent attention. Using simulations of high-redshift 158$\mu$m [CII] and 88$\mu$m [OIII] LIM signals created by the LIMFAST code, we develop an ILI framework in a case study of learning the physics of early galaxy formation from the auto-power spectra of these lines or their cross-correlation with galaxy surveys. We leverage neural density estimation with normalizing flows to learn the mapping between the simulated power spectra and parameters that characterize the physics governing the star formation efficiency and the $\dot{\Sigma}_{\star}$-$\Sigma_\mathrm{g}$ relation of high-redshift galaxies. Our results show that their partially degenerate effects can be unambiguously constrained when combining [CII] with [OIII] measurements to be made by new-generation mm/sub-mm LIM experiments.",
New submissions,Prospects and Limitations of PTAs Anisotropy Searches -- The Frequentist Case,"Thomas Konstandin,Anna-Malin Lemke,Andrea Mitridate,Enrico Perboni",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent findings from several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations point to the existence of a Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies. A key next step towards characterizing this signal and identifying its origin is to map the sky distribution of its power. Several strategies have been proposed to reconstruct this distribution using PTA data. In this work, we compare these different strategies to determine which one is best suited to detect GWB anisotropies of different topologies. We find that, for both localized and large-scale anisotropies, reconstruction methods based on pixel and radiometer maps are the most promising. However, in both scenarios, even the optimistically large anisotropic signals discussed in this work remain challenging to detect with near-future PTA sensitivities. For example, we find that for a GWB hotspot contributing to $80\%$ of the GWB power in the second frequency bin, detection probabilities reach at most $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ for a PTA with noise properties comparable with the ones of the upcoming IPTA third data release. Finally, we consider the fundamental limitations that cosmic variance poses to these kinds of searches by deriving the smallest deviations from isotropy that could be detected by an idealized PTA with no experimental or pulsar noise.",
New submissions,Why Cosmic Voids Matter: Pristine Evolution,"Nico Schuster,Nico Hamaus,Alice Pisani,Klaus Dolag,Jochen Weller",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We utilize the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of cosmic voids from $z = 5.04$ to present day, using cold dark matter and (sub-) halo tracers in high-density samples. This includes the evolution of their global properties, such as size, shape, inner density, and average density, as well as their radial density profiles. Our results provide several key conclusions for void analyses in modern surveys. We demonstrate that a relative size framework is required, mitigating methodological selection effects and revealing the true physical evolution of densities around halo-defined voids. This necessity arises from our findings that a void's properties are more fundamentally tied to its rank within its contemporary population than to its absolute size. Using this framework, we show that the evolution of halo voids stabilizes at redshifts below $z \simeq 1$, driven primarily by cosmic expansion rather than ongoing halo formation. We further find that the matter evolution around these stable voids is remarkably well-described by linear growth theory, with deviations appearing as non-linear growth on small scales and suppressed growth in the largest voids, potentially driven by the influence of dark energy. This late-time stability and the predictable evolution confirm voids as pristine laboratories for probing the nature of dark energy with upcoming surveys.",
New submissions,Carnegie Supernova Project: Fast-Declining Type Ia Supernovae as Cosmological Distance Indicators,"M. M. Phillips,Syed A. Uddin,Christopher R. Burns,Nicholas B. Suntzeff,C. Ashall,E. Baron,L. Galbany,P. Hoeflich,E. Y. Hsiao,Nidia Morrell,S. E. Persson,Maximilian Stritzinger,Carlos Contreras,Wendy L. Freedman,Kevin Krisciunas,S. Kumar,J. Lu,Anthony L. Piro,M. Shahbandeh",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this paper, the suitability of fast-declining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological standard candles is examined utilizing a Hubble Flow sample of 43 of these objects observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). We confirm previous suggestions that fast-declining SNe Ia offer a viable method for estimating distances to early-type galaxies when the color-stretch parameter, $s_{BV}$, is used as a measure of the light curve shape. As a test, we employ the Tripp (1998) method, which models the absolute magnitude at maximum as a function of light curve shape and color. We calibrate the sample using 12 distance moduli based on published Infrared Surface Brightness Fluctuations to derive a value of the Hubble constant that is in close agreement with the value found by Uddin et al. (2024), using the same methodology, but with the full sample of CSP SNe Ia. We also develop a new and simple method of estimating the distances of fast decliners only based on their colors at maximum (and not light curve shape) and find that it has a precision similar to the Tripp method. This ""Color"" technique is a powerful tool that is unique to fast-declining SNe Ia. We show that the colors of the fast decliners at maximum light are strongly affected by photospheric temperature differences and not solely due to dust extinction, and provide a physical rationale for this effect.",
New submissions,Estimating the heterogeneity of pressure profiles within a complete sample of 55 galaxy clusters: a Bayesian Hierarchical Model,"Fabio Castagna,Stefano Andreon,Marco Landoni,Alberto Trombetta",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxy clusters exhibit heterogeneity in their pressure profiles, even after rescaling, highlighting the need for adequately sized samples to accurately capture variations across the cluster population. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model that simultaneously fits individual cluster parameters and the underlying population distribution, providing estimates of the population-averaged pressure profile and the intrinsic scatter, as well as accurate pressure estimates for individual objects. We introduce a highly flexible, low-covariance, and interpretable parameterization of the pressure profile based on restricted cubic splines. We model the scatter properly accounting for outliers, and we incorporate corrections for beam and transfer function, as required for SZ data. Our model is applied to the largest non-stacked sample of individual cluster radial profiles, extracted from SPT+Planck Compton-y maps. This is a complete sample of 55 clusters, with $0.05<z<0.30$ and $M_{500}>4\times 10^{14}M_\odot$, enabling subdivision into sizable morphological classes based on eROSITA data. The shape of the population-averaged profile, at our 250 kpc FWHM resolution, closely resembles the universal pressure profile, despite the flexibility of our model to accommodate alternative shapes, with a ~12% lower normalization, similar to what is needed to alleviate the tension between cosmological parameters derived from the CMB and Planck SZ cluster counts. Beyond $r_{500}$, our profile is steeper than previous determinations. The intrinsic scatter is consistent with or lower than previous estimates, despite the broader diversity expected from our SZ selection. Our flexible pressure modelization identifies a few clusters with non-standard concavity in their radial profiles but no outliers in amplitude. When dividing the sample by morphology, we find remarkably similar pressure profiles across classes.",
New submissions,Cosmic Rays on Galaxy Scales: Progress and Pitfalls for CR-MHD Dynamical Models,Philip F. Hopkins,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Space Physics (physics.space-ph),"Recent years have seen many arguments for cosmic rays (CRs) as an important influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their fundamental dependence on the micro (< au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso (~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic, Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling, including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM) observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons; new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD simulations.",
New submissions,Morphological characteristics of protohalos and their connection to halo formation histories,"Farnik Nikakhtar,Daisuke Nagai,Marcello Musso,Ravi K. Sheth",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Protohalos, primordial regions in the initial cosmic density field that evolve into dark matter halos, are crucial for understanding cosmic structure formation. Motivated by the potential to reconstruct protohalo positions and shapes from observed galaxies using a novel approach grounded in optimal transport theory, we revisit the relationship between the structural properties of protohalos and the formation histories, concentrations, and final morphologies of their associated dark matter halos. To better understand halo assembly, we introduce a new estimator defined by an integral over redshifts and compare its performance to $z_{50}$, the commonly used redshift at which half of the final halo mass is formed. We quantify protohalo structure using the three invariants of the inertia, deformation, and energy shear tensors. Although past research has correlated the first two invariants of the deformation and energy tensors with halo formation, our findings reveal that the third invariant also significantly correlates with the final halo shape. We discuss the prospect of using optimal transport to connect our protohalo results to observations of high-redshift protoclusters to better align theoretical models with observational data.",
New submissions,Probing the Cosmological Principle with CMB lensing and cosmic shear,"James Adam,Roy Maartens,Julien Larena,Chris Clarkson,Ruth Durrer",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The standard cosmological model assumes the Cosmological Principle. However, recent observations hint at possible violations of isotropy on large scales, possibly through late-time anisotropic expansion. Here we investigate the potential of cross-correlations between CMB lensing convergence $\kappa$ and galaxy cosmic shear $B$-modes as a novel probe of such late-time anisotropies. Our signal-to-noise forecasts reveal that information from the $\kappa$-$B$ cross-correlation is primarily contained on large angular scales ($\ell \lesssim 200$). We find that this cross-correlation for a Euclid-like galaxy survey is sensitive to anisotropy at the percent level. Making use of tomography yields a modest improvement of $\sim 20\%$ in detection power. Incorporating the galaxy $E$-$B$ cross-correlations would further enhance these constraints.",
New submissions,Cluster Catalog Validation with Multiwavelength Data,"Ethan K. Steelberg,Tesla E. Jeltema,Jackson H. O'Donnell,Rance Solomon, TheLSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a ground-breaking data set for cosmology, but to achieve the precision needed, the data, data reduction, and algorithms measuring the cosmological data vectors must be thoroughly validated and calibrated. In this note, we focus on clusters of galaxies and present a set of validation tests for optical cluster finding algorithms through comparison to X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect cluster catalogs. As an example, we apply our pipeline to compare the performance of the redMaPPer (red-sequence Matched filter Probabilistic Percolation) and WaZP (Wavelet Z Photometric) cluster finding algorithms on Dark Energy Survey (DES) data.",
New submissions,Cross-correlations between the CLAMATO Lyman-alpha forest and galaxies within the COSMOS field,"Benjamin Zhang,Khee-Gan Lee,Andrei Cuceu,Andreu Font-Ribera,Rieko Momose",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We compute the 3D cross-correlation between the absorption of the $z\sim 2.3$ Lyman-alpha forest measured by the COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And Tomography Observations (CLAMATO) survey, and 1642 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from several different surveys, including 3D-HST, CLAMATO, zCOSMOS-Deep, MOSDEF, and VUDS. For each survey, we compare the measured cross-correlation with models incorporating the galaxy linear bias as well as observed redshift dispersion and systematic redshift offset. The derived redshift dispersion and offsets are generally consistent with those expected from, e.g., spectroscopic redshifts measured with UV absorption lines or NIR emission lines observed with specific instruments, but we find hints of `fingers-of-god' caused by overdensities in the field. We combine our foreground galaxy sample, and split them into 3 bins of robustly-estimated stellar mass in order to study the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. For sub-samples with median stellar masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) = [9.23,9.71,10.21]$, we find galaxy biases of $b_g\approx [2.9, 3.3,4.7]$, respectively. A comparison with mock measurements from the Bolshoi-Planck $N$-body simulation yields corresponding halo masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) \approx [10.3,11.6,12.1]$ for these stellar mass bins. At the low mass end, our results suggest enhanced star formation histories in mild tension with predictions from previous angular correlation and abundance matching-based observations, and the IllustrisTNG simulation.",
New submissions,Intrinsic alignments of galaxies in multiple projections,"Marloes van Heukelum,Dennis Neumann,Marta Garcia Escobar,Nora Elisa Chisari,Henk Hoekstra",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Intrinsic alignments of galaxies are measured and modelled to gain cosmological information, to further understand the interactions between galaxies and to mitigate their effects on gravitational weak lensing studies. Hydrodynamical simulations are often used to constrain priors or calibrate models. Therefore, obtaining the maximum amount of information possible from these simulations is imperative. In this work, we have combined the information of shapes projected over two or three axes ($x,y,z$), for intrinsic alignment signals ($w_{g+},\ \tilde{\xi}_{g+,2}$), showing a consistent gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all cases studied using TNG300-1. The gain in SNR is found to be higher for the addition of the second projection than for the third, and higher for shapes calculated using the reduced inertia tensor rather than the simple one. The two shape samples studied, $n_\star>300$ and $\mathrm{log}(M_\star \ h/\mathrm{M_\odot})>10.5$, where the latter has a much higher signal amplitude, show similar gains in SNR when more projections are added. We also model the correlation functions with the non-linear alignment model. The SNR gains from the measurements are higher but consistent with the constraints on the non-linear alignment amplitude $A_{\rm IA}$ and galaxy bias $b_{\rm g}$. Using multiple projection axes increases SNR overall, enabling more efficient use of numerically expensive hydrodynamical simulations.",
New submissions,A comprehensive separation of dark matter and baryonic mass components in galaxy clusters I: Mass constraints from Abell S1063,"Benjamin Beauchesne,Benjamin Clément,Marceau Limousin,Belén Alcalde Pampliega,Mathilde Jauzac,Anna Niemiec,Johan Richard,Guillaume Mahler,Jose M. Diego,Pascale Hibon,Anton M. Koekemoer,Thomas Connor,Jean-Paul Kneib,Andreas L. Faisst",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this two-part series, we present a multi-probe mass modelling method for massive galaxy clusters, designed to disentangle the contributions of individual mass components (Dark matter, intra-cluster gas, stellar masses). In this first paper, we focus on recovering the mass constraint datasets required for the modelling approach introduced in the second paper. Specifically, we measure the light distribution, stellar mass, and kinematics of the cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the intra-cluster light (ICL) in Abell S1063. To that end, we developed a new method to extract the light profiles of the cluster members, BCG, and ICL, while accounting for contamination from nearby foreground and background galaxies in \textsc{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) imaging. We obtained light profiles for $289$ cluster members using a dual Pseudo-Isothermal Elliptical (dPIE) model based on the HST F160W filter, while the BCG \& ICL is modelled as a single component using a multi-Gaussian expansion. To estimate stellar masses and velocity dispersions, we rely on multi-band HST photometry and \textsc{VLT/MUSE} integral field spectroscopy, respectively. Stellar masses are derived using three different spectral energy distribution (SED) models. We measure the line-of-sight velocity dispersions of the cluster members at their half-light radii, as determined from their light profiles, while for the BCG \& ICL components, we use elliptical annular apertures. Thanks to these measurements, we will be able to constrain the cluster stellar mass content, which is detailed in the second paper of the series. We publicly release these measurements with intermediary data products.",
New submissions,A comprehensive separation of dark matter and baryonic mass components in galaxy clusters II: an overview of the mass distribution in Abell S1063,"Benjamin Beauchesne,Benjamin Clément,Marceau Limousin,Anna Niemiec,Mathilde Jauzac,Belén Alcalde Pampliega,Johan Richard,Guillaume Mahler,Jose M. Diego,Pascale Hibon,Anton M. Koekemoer,Thomas Connor,Jean-Paul Kneib,Andreas L. Faisst",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"In the first paper of this series, we derived mass constraints on the total mass and the baryonic components of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063. The main focus was to recover stellar masses and kinematics for cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). In this second paper, we introduce a multi-probe mass modelling approach that incorporates constraints on both the total mass and the individual baryonic components. We obtain comprehensive mass models of Abell S1063, in which the dark matter distribution is disentangled from the baryonic mass at both cluster and galaxy scales. The best-fitting mass model achieves an RMS of $0.50""$ on the multiple image positions. The kinematic profiles of the BCG \& ICL, as well as the X-ray surface brightness of the intra-cluster gas, are accurately reproduced within observational uncertainties. However, a $35~\mathrm{km/s}$ scatter is required for the cluster member line-of-sight dispersions. This method yields the most complex parametric mass model with consistency among almost all available mass constraints. We find a $1\sigma$ agreement between the inferred stellar-to-subhalo mass relation and that predicted by large-scale cosmological simulations. The ICL stellar mass derived from our model is consistent with estimates from stellar population modelling. We present the first multi-probe mass modelling method capable of disentangling the dark matter from the baryonic mass distributions in massive galaxy clusters. Its results, such as the stellar-to-subhalo mass relation or the distribution of each mass component, can be directly compared to hydrodynamical cosmological simulations such as illustrisTNG.",
New submissions,A dense dark matter core of the subhalo in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666,"Lei Lei,Yi-Ying Wang,Qiao Li,Jiang Dong,Ze-Fan Wang,Wei-Long Lin,Yi-Ping Shu,Xiao-Yue Cao,Da-Neng Yang,Yi-Zhong Fan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.",
New submissions,Suppression of the induced gravitational wave background due to third-order perturbations,"Raphael Picard,Luis E. Padilla,Karim A. Malik,David J. Mulryne",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we revisit and evaluate new source terms which contribute to the induced gravitational wave background. We study their respective contributions to the stochastic gravitational wave background by computing their spectral densities in a radiation-dominated universe. These terms appear at third order in cosmological perturbation theory, however, their correlations with primordial gravitational waves are non-trivial and appear at the same order as so-called scalar induced and scalar-tensor induced gravitational waves. We find that these gravitational wave sources suppress the spectral density at the scales we consider. Furthermore, similarly to scalar-tensor source terms at second order, we find that some terms are enhanced when the input primordial power spectrum of scalar fluctuations is not sufficiently peaked. Hence, where possible, we show that under certain limits the integrands of these terms diverge in the UV sector.",
New submissions,Probing the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation via Non-Parametric Reconstruction for High Redshifts,"Felipe Avila,Fernanda Oliveira,Camila Franco,Maria Lopes,Rodrigo Holanda,Rafael C. Nunes,Armando Bernui",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We test the validity of the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by combining angular diameter distance and luminosity distance measurements from recent cosmological observations. For the angular diameter distance, we use data from transverse baryon acoustic oscillations and galaxy clusters. On the other hand, the luminosity distance is obtained from Type Ia supernovae in the Pantheon+ sample and from quasar catalogs. To reduce the large dispersion in quasar luminosity distances, we apply a selection criterion based on their deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model and implement a binning procedure to suppress statistical noise. We reconstruct the CDDR using Gaussian Processes, a non-parametric supervised machine learning method. Our results show no significant deviation from the CDDR within the $2\sigma$ confidence level across the redshift range explored, supporting its validity even at high redshifts.",

Defining the final survey footprint is critical, as it excludes regions affected by artefacts or suboptimal observing conditions. For galaxy clustering, spatially varying observational systematics, such as seeing, are a leading source of bias. Template maps of contaminants are used to derive spatially dependent corrections, but extreme values may fall outside the applicability range of mitigation methods, compromising correction reliability. The complexity and accuracy of systematics modelling depend on footprint conservativeness, with aggressive masking enabling simpler, robust mitigation. We present a unified approach to define the DES Year 6 joint footprint, integrating observational systematics templates and artefact indicators that degrade mitigation performance. This removes extreme values from an initial seed footprint, leading to the final joint footprint. By evaluating the DES Year 6 lens sample MagLim++ plus plus on this footprint, we enhance the Iterative Systematics Decontamination (ISD) method, detecting non-linear systematic contamination and improving correction accuracy. While the mask's impact on clustering is less significant than systematics decontamination, it remains non-negligible, comparable to statistical uncertainties in certain w(theta) scales and redshift bins. Supporting coherent analyses of galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, the final footprint spans 4031.04 deg2, setting the basis for DES Year 6 1x2pt, 2x2pt, and 3x2pt analyses. This work highlights how targeted masking strategies optimise the balance between statistical power and systematic control in Stage-III and -IV surveys.",

Yamamoto",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we derive and calibrate the redshift distribution of the MagLim++ lens galaxy sample used in the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6) 3x2pt cosmology analysis. The 3x2pt analysis combines galaxy clustering from the lens galaxy sample and weak gravitational lensing. The redshift distributions are inferred using the SOMPZ method - a Self-Organizing Map framework that combines deep-field multi-band photometry, wide-field data, and a synthetic source injection (Balrog) catalog. Key improvements over the DES Year 3 (Y3) calibration include a noise-weighted SOM metric, an expanded Balrog catalogue, and an improved scheme for propagating systematic uncertainties, which allows us to generate O($10^8$) redshift realizations that collectively span the dominant sources of uncertainty. These realizations are then combined with independent clustering-redshift measurements via importance sampling. The resulting calibration achieves typical uncertainties on the mean redshift of 1-2%, corresponding to a 20-30% average reduction relative to DES Y3. We compress the $n(z)$ uncertainties into a small number of orthogonal modes for use in cosmological inference. Marginalizing over these modes leads to only a minor degradation in cosmological constraints. This analysis establishes the MagLim++ sample as a robust lens sample for precision cosmology with DES Y6 and provides a scalable framework for future surveys.",
New submissions,Towards an application of fourth-order shear statistics I. The information content of $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^4 \rangle $,"Elena Silvestre-Rosello,Lucas Porth,Peter Schneider,Laila Linke,Jonas Krueger,Sebastian Grandis,Jonathan Oel",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Higher-order shear statistics contain part of the non-Gaussian information of the projected matter field and therefore can provide additional constraints on the cosmological parameters when combined with second-order statistics. We aim to provide the theoretical framework for studying shear four-point correlation functions (4PCF) using fourth-order aperture statistics and develop a numerical integration pipeline to compute them. Finally, we forecast the information content of fourth-order aperture statistics. We begin by giving the relation of the $n$-th order aperture statistics, $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^n\rangle$, to the shear $n$PCF and to the convergence polyspectra. We then focus on the fourth-order case, where we derive the functional form of their filters and test the behavior of these filters by numerically integrating over the 4PCF of a Gaussian random shear field (GRF). Finally, we perform a Fisher forecast on the constraining power of $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^4\rangle_\rm{c}$, where we develop a novel method to estimate derivatives from a simulation suite with arbitrarily distributed cosmological sets. By analyzing and mitigating numerical effects within the integration pipeline, we achieve a two-percent-level precision on the fourth-order aperture statistics for a GRF, which remains well below the noise budget of Stage IV surveys. We report a minimal improvement in the constraining power of the aperture statistics when including fourth-order statistics to a $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^2\rangle + \langle M_\mathrm{ap}^3\rangle$ joint analysis for a DES-Y3-like setup, using non-tomographic equal-scale aperture statistics.",
New submissions,Towards an application of fourth-order shear statistics II: Efficient estimation of fourth-order shear correlation functions and an application to the DES Y3 data,"Lucas Porth,Elena Silvestre-Rosello,Peter Schneider,Martina Larma",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Higher-order lensing statistics contain a wealth of cosmological information that is not captured by second-order statistics. Stage-III lensing surveys have sufficient statistical power to significantly detect cumulant-based statistics up to fourth order. We derive and validate an efficient estimation procedure for the four-point correlation function (4PCF) of polar fields such as weak lensing shear. We then use our approach to measure the shear 4PCF and the fourth-order aperture mass statistics in the DES Y3 survey. We construct an efficient estimator for fourth-order shear statistics which builds on the multipole decomposition of the shear 4PCF. We then validate our estimator on mock ellipticity catalogues obtained from Gaussian random fields and on realistic $N$-body simulations. Finally, we apply our estimator to the DES Y3 data and present a measurement of the fourth-order aperture statistics in a non-tomographic setup. Due to its quadratic scaling, our estimator provides a significant speed-up over hypothetical brute force or tree-based estimation methods of the shear 4PCF. We report a significant detection of the connected part of the fourth-order aperture mass in the DES Y3 data. We find the sampling distribution of the fourth-order aperture mass to be significantly skewed. We make our estimator code available on GitHub as part of the orpheus package.",
Cross submissions,Reviving WIMP dark matter with temperature-dependent couplings,"Debasish Borah,Arnab Dasgupta,Tong Arthur Wu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The persistent null results at dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments have pushed the popular weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) DM to tight corners. Generic WIMP models with direct detection rate below the current upper limits often lead to thermally overproduced relic abundance after freeze-out. To resolve this conundrum, we propose a novel scenario where DM has temperature-dependent couplings with the standard model (SM) bath. A scalar field having a large vacuum expectation value (VEV) at high temperatures generates sizeable DM-SM interactions leading to efficient DM annihilations responsible for generating the desired thermal relic. At lower temperatures, the scalar field VEV settles down to a small value as a result of a first-order phase transition (FOPT), effectively leading to suppressed DM-SM interaction rate at low temperature, consistent with null results at direct detection experiments. Upper bound on thermal DM mass forces the FOPT to occur at scales such that the corresponding gravitational wave signal remains within reach of future experiments like LISA.",
Cross submissions,Boiling After the Dust Settles: Constraining First-Order Phase Transitions During Dark Energy Domination,"Seth Koren,Yuhsin Tsai,Runqing Wang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A first-order phase transition could occur in the late universe when vacuum energy begins dominating the energy density ($z \lesssim 0.3$) and convert some latent heat into other forms such as invisible radiation. This generic possibility also has concrete motivation in particle physics models which invoke a multitude of vacua to address theoretical puzzles. The naïve constraint on such an event comes from measurements of the Hubble expansion rate, but this can only probe transitions involving $\mathcal{O}(10)\%$ of the dark energy. In this work, we show that significantly tighter constraints appear when accounting for phase transition fluctuations affecting CMB photon propagation anisotropically, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. For instance, if a completed phase transition has $\beta/H_\star\lesssim 25$, current CMB data limits the associated vacuum energy released to less than $1\%$ of the dark energy. A transition to negative vacuum energy (quasi-anti-de Sitter) is allowed only for $\beta/H_\star \gtrsim 300$. For $\beta/H_\star \lesssim 500$, the universe will not crunch for at least $14$ Gyr.",
Cross submissions,Self-similar collapse with elasticity,"Jorge V. Rocha,Diogo L. F. G. Silva",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Critical collapse is a well-studied subject for a variety of self-gravitating matter. One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids, which have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as well as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to possess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and critical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In this work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study self-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show that including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations, which we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value problem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode, but also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid case, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the addition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\mathrm{s}$ or decreasing the Poisson ratio $\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and can yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the elastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible transverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid case can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not seem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters of the material. This study represents the first step in the analysis of critical collapse with elastic materials.",

Specifically, we study a minimal, UV-complete $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model with a Dirac DM candidate, whose annihilation into neutrinos proceeds exclusively through a $Z^\prime$ boson. By computing the annihilation cross section and comparing with the observed flux, we derive bounds on the model parameters. Additional constraints are obtained within the freeze-in framework, where the observed relic abundance is reproduced, leading to the strongest bounds. Considering cosmic string vibrations as a source of gravitational waves, we further constrain the vacuum expectation value of the $U(1)$ breaking. All results are contrasted with perturbativity limits and existing constraints from low- and high-energy experiments.",

Cross submissions,Inflationary Decoherence from the Gravitational Floor,"C.P. Burgess,R. Holman,Greg Kaplanek",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We re-examine the decoherence rate of primordial fluctuations within minimal inflationary models, using only the gravitational interactions required for the underlying fluctuation-generation mechanism itself. Since gravity provides the weakest interactions the result provides a plausible floor on the rate of primordial decoherence. Previous calculations (arXiv:2211.11046) did so using only a subset of these interactions, motivated by assuming both system and environment were super-Hubble. We extend this by including the effects on super-Hubble modes of {\it all} gravitational interactions at leading order in H/Mp (and so need not restrict the decohering environment to being super-Hubble). We show how the decohering evolution becomes Markovian for super-Hubble modes, without the need to appeal to truncations (like the `rotating wave' approximation) that are often used in optics but can be inapprorpriate for cosmology. We find that the dominant contribution comes from the nonlocal cubic interactions obtained by solving the constraints. We identify UV divergences systematically and verify thereby that the leading part of the purity evolution is UV finite. In the end we find a decoherence rate that grows in the super-Hubble regime significantly {\it faster} than found earlier. We take the preliminary steps to resum this result to late times and briefly discuss why they are more complicated than for earlier calculations.",
Cross submissions,Dynamical Dark Energy or Modified Gravity? Signatures in Gravitational Wave Propagation,"Purnendu Karmakar,Sandeep Haridasu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We discuss the implications of the most recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) DR2 and DESyr5 compilation of supernovae (SNe) datasets for modified gravity focusing on non-metricity based $f(Q)$ theory, by employing a `model-independent' approach. We reconstruct of dark energy density which is then extended to estimate the perturbation-level quantities, sourced by the modified gravity, namely the effective gravitational coupling, $\mu$, and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave propagation, $\nu$. In light of the remarkable hints for a dynamical dark energy emerging from the analysis of background cosmological data, we discuss the possibility to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity scenarios from their scalar and tensor perturbation-level signatures. We contrast our findings between the older Pantheon+ and the newer DESyr5 compilations of SNe datasets, which predict a significant distinct signature in the damping parameter of the gravitational wave propagation amplitude. On the other hand, the prediction for the effective gravitational coupling remains insensitive to the choice of the SNe datasets. Our results provide a strong case for the study of gravitational wave propagation in modified gravity theories, in light of the new generation of gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.",
