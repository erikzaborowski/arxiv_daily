New submissions,Covariant cosmography in the presence of local structures: comparing exact solutions and perturbation theory,"Maharshi Sarma,Christian Marinoni,Basheer Kalbouneh,Chris Clarkson,Roy Maartens",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent observational evidence of axially symmetric anisotropies in the local cosmic expansion rate motivates an investigation of whether they can be accounted for within the Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) framework with an off-center observer. Within this setting, we compute the exact relativistic luminosity distance via the Sachs equation and compare it with the approximate expression obtained from the covariant cosmographic approach (including Hubble, deceleration, jerk and curvature parameters). This comparison allows us to identify the regimes in which the covariant cosmographic method remains reliable. In addition, we compare the LTB relativistic distance for small inhomogeneities with the corresponding result derived from linear perturbation theory (LPT) in the standard cosmological model. This analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the LTB and LPT approaches, offering a consistent dictionary for the interpretation of the observed anisotropies of the large-scale gravitational field. This analysis will be instrumental in interpreting expansion-rate anisotropies, facilitating investigations of the local Universe beyond the FLRW framework with a fully non-perturbative metric approach.",
New submissions,Signatures of Galactic Expansion in Gaia DR3: Implications for the JWST Early-Galaxy Puzzle,"G. S. Karapetian,A. P. Mahtessian,L. E. Byzalov,M. A. Hovhannisyan,L. A. Mahtessian",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of massive galaxies at ages below 1 Gyr pose a challenge to standard models of galaxy formation, which predict significantly longer assembly timescales. One possible explanation is that active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive large scale outflows that accelerate galaxy growth. To test this scenario in the local Universe, we analyzed Gaia DR3 data for stars within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, computing galactocentric radial velocities (v_radial_gc) in 27 spatial sectors covering the entire Galaxy, with radial binning of 0.25 kpc. Coordinate transformations and velocity calculations were performed using the Astropy library. We find that 21 of 27 sectors exhibit statistically significant outward motions of 3-50 km/s, while one quadrant shows negative velocities, likely related to the configuration of an activity zone and/or the Galactic bar. Both disk and halo populations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s (p<0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where globular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and axisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5 kpc. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Milky Way exhibits measurable central expansion, potentially reflecting AGN-driven feedback. This interpretation departs from standard theory and should be regarded as preliminary, requiring further study. However, if confirmed, such expansion could provide a natural explanation for the rapid appearance of massive galaxies observed by JWST.",
New submissions,Revisiting Gaussian Process Reconstruction for Cosmological Inference: The Generalised GP (Gen GP) Framework,"Ruchika,Purba Mukherjee,Arianna Favale",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate uncertainties in the estimation of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) arising from Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction, demonstrating that the choice of kernel introduces systematic variations comparable to those arising from different cosmological models. To address this limitation, we introduce the Generalized Gaussian Process (Gen GP) framework, in which the Matérn smoothness parameter $\nu$ is treated as a free parameter, allowing for data-driven kernel optimization. Using the cosmic chronometer Hubble data, we find that while standard GP with $\Lambda$CDM mean function exhibits noticeable reconstruction differences between optimized and marginalized approaches, particularly at $z > 1$, Gen GP maintains methodological consistency.In Gen GP, slight increases in $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom relative to standard GP, for both the zero-mean and $\Lambda$CDM prior mean cases, reflect added flexibility rather than performance degradation. Our results emphasize that robust cosmological inference requires treating kernel parameters as free variables and implementing full Bayesian marginalization to avoid artificial precision from fixed hyperparameters. As machine learning becomes central to cosmological discovery, the Gen GP framework provides a principled approach to model-independent inference that properly accounts for methodological uncertainties while maintaining necessary flexibility for reliable parameter estimation.",
New submissions,Beyond CPL: Evidence for dynamical dark energy in three-parameter models,"Sonej Alam,Md. Wali Hossain",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We introduce three-parameter extensions of the two-parameter minimal Akhtar-Hossain (mAH) parametrization, termed modified minimal AH (MmAH1,2), which provide greater flexibility in the dynamics of dark energy. These models are compared with $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, mAH, CPL, and three-parameter CPL (CPL-$w_{\rm b}$) using a joint data set of the CMB compressed likelihood, DESI DR2, Pantheon$+$ supernovae, $H(z)$ measurements, and redshift-space distortions. While the common cosmological parameters remain stable across models, CPL and the MmAH1,2 yield modest improvements in fit, with $\Delta\chi^2\simeq -6$ to $-7$ and corresponding $\Delta{\rm AIC}\simeq -1$ to $-2$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting a mild preference for dynamical dark energy. Statistical consistency with $\Lambda$CDM is quantified via the Mahalanobis distance in one, two, and three dimensional parameter subspaces. In 1D, the strongest deviation occurs for MmAH1 ($2.5\sigma$), followed by CPL ($2.3\sigma$). In 2D, CPL-$w_{\rm b}$ shows the highest discrepancy ($2.3\sigma$), while other models remain at the $1.7$-$2.1\sigma$ level. In 3D, CPL-$w_{\rm b}$ continues to exhibit the largest tension ($\sim2\sigma$), though this arises in the presence of very strong correlations, particularly between $w_{\rm a}$ and $w_{\rm b}$, whereas the MmAH extensions display slightly weaker but still non-negligible discrepancies ($1.4$-$1.8\sigma$). Overall, these results indicate consistent evidence for departures from $\Lambda$CDM.",
New submissions,Crosschecking Cosmic Distances from DESI BAO and DES SNe Points to Systematics,"Mauricio Lopez-Hernandez,Eoin Ó Colgáin,Saeed Pourojaghi,M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We perform a consistency check of DESI DR2 BAO constraints ($D_M/r_d, D_H/r_d)$ by reconstructing the same quantities from DES supernovae (SNe) in bins with the same effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$. We find that the ratio of $D_M/r_d$ values are consistent with a horizontal, thus confirming that the distance duality relation holds up to calibration. However, the $D_H/r_d$ ratio shows a decreasing trend with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ at $2.3 \sigma$ to $2.5 \sigma$ that cannot be explained by physics. We demonstrate that the result does not depend on the choice of cosmological model, but the radius of the sound horizon $r_d$ has a much greater influence. Studying ratios of $D_H/r_d$ is a stronger test than the distance duality relation, and the rejection of a horizontal confirms systematics in either DESI BAO or DES SNe. Claims of new physics based on combined data still have rudimentary hurdles to clear.",
New submissions,Is CPL dark energy a mirage?,"Mikel Artola,Ismael Ayuso,Ruth Lazkoz,Vincenzo Salzano",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) raise doubts about the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting a preference for an inherently dynamical dark energy component. The Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization -- a widely used two-parameter model for the dark energy equation of state -- displays marked early-time phantom behavior and a recent crossing of the phantom divide. These features suggest the convenience to check observationally the robustness of such evolution. To address this, we design two alternative families of two-parameter dark energy parameterizations which remain close to the original CPL but aim to soften its phantom character. Specifically, these models reproduce CPL-like behavior at low redshift but mitigate early phantom behavior through the use of smooth sigmoid transitions, yielding a more gradual evolution. By combining recent DESI data with constraints from the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae, we assess the viability of these models. Our analysis shows that CPL remains a strong and competitive parameterization, with the proposed alternatives only marginally favored or disfavored. We conclude that current observational data lack the statistical precision to decisively distinguish between CPL and similarly constructed parameterizations across the redshift range probed by late-time observables.",
New submissions,Probing dust torus radius--luminosity relation: An WISE view,"Ashutosh Tomar,Suvendu Rakshit,Amit Kumar Mandal,Shivangi Pandey",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present measurements of the dusty torus sizes of 51 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a redshift of $z<$ 0.8. Our analysis utilizes about 16 years of optical photometric data of 146 AGNs from various time-domain surveys, including ASAS-SN, CRTS, and ZTF, along with 14 years of infrared data in the $W$1 ($\sim$ 3.4 $\mu$m) and $W$2 ($\sim$ 4.6 $\mu$m) bands obtained from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The estimated dust torus size ranges from 1000 to 3000 days, using both the cross-correlation analysis and lightcurve modeling through `MICA'. The measured lag has been corrected by $(1+z)^{-0.37}$, to account for cosmological time dilation and the torus temperature-gradient scaling. We conduct a linear regression analysis for both the $W$1 and $W$2 bands to examine the radius--luminosity ($R$--$L_{BOL}$) relationship under two conditions: one where the slope is fixed at 0.5 and one where it is allowed to vary. For the fixed slope of 0.5, we find the ratio of R$_{\mathrm{BLR}}$: R$_{W1}$: R$_{W2}$ to be 1: 9: 12, indicating that the torus lies outside the BLR and that its size increases with wavelength. Furthermore, we determine the relationship between torus size and L$_{BOL}$, yielding best-fit slopes of $0.413\pm0.047$ for the $W$1 band and $0.397\pm0.058$ for the $W$2 band. Both slopes are shallower than predicted by the dust radiation equilibrium model. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the torus size systematically decreases as the Eddington ratio increases, a trend that can be explained by the self-shadowing effects of slim disks.",
New submissions,Neutrinogenic CMB spectral distortions,"Shao-Ping Li,Jens Chluba",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Extra radiation injection after neutrino decoupling in the early Universe contributes to the effective number of neutrino species that can be constrained by the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, any effective neutrino number itself cannot uniquely determine the underlying source. We argue that the degeneracy can be relaxed by CMB spectral distortions, which are caused by energy exchange between the extra radiation and photons. We consider neutrinogenic CMB spectral distortions, where extra energy is released in the form of neutrinos but still creates the CMB spectral distortions via electroweak interactions. The synergy between the effective neutrino number and CMB spectral distortions provides a complementary probe of hidden sectors that dominantly couple to neutrinos, opening up parameter space that can be targeted by joint CMB anisotropy and spectral distortion experiments.",
New submissions,Stochastic instantons and the tail of the inflationary density perturbation,"Jaime Calderón-Figueroa,David Seery",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the ""stochastic $\delta N$ formalism"", the statistics of the inflationary density perturbation are obtained from the first passage distribution of a stochastic process. We develop a general framework in which to evaluate the rare tail of this distribution, based on an instanton approximation to a path integral representation for the transition probability. We relate our formalism to the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, by integrating out short wavelength degrees of freedom to produce an influence functional. This provides a principled way to extend the calculation beyond the slow-roll limit, and to models with multiple fields. We argue that our framework has a number of advantages in comparison with existing methods. In particular, it reliably captures the tail behaviour in cases where existing techniques do not apply, including cases where the noise amplitude has strong time dependence. We demonstrate the method by computing the tail probability in a number of scenarios, including a beyond-slow-roll analysis of a linear potential, ultra-slow-roll, and constant-roll inflation. We find close agreement with results already reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss a scenario with exponentially decaying noise amplitude. This is a model for the stochastic evolution of a fixed comoving volume of spacetime on superhorizon scales. In this case we show that the tail reverts to a Gaussian weight.",
New submissions,Matching JWST UV Luminosity Functions with Refined $Λ$CDM Halo Models,"Saeed Fakhry,Maryam Shiravand,Antonino Del Popolo",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$, posing a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo \textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at $z \gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.",
New submissions,Euclid preparation: Towards a DR1 application of higher-order weak lensing statistics,Euclid Collaboration,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This is the second paper in the HOWLS (higher-order weak lensing statistics) series exploring the usage of non-Gaussian statistics for cosmology inference within \textit{Euclid}. With respect to our first paper, we develop a full tomographic analysis based on realistic photometric redshifts which allows us to derive Fisher forecasts in the ($\sigma_8$, $w_0$) plane for a \textit{Euclid}-like data release 1 (DR1) setup. We find that the 5 higher-order statistics (HOSs) that satisfy the Gaussian likelihood assumption of the Fisher formalism (1-point probability distribution function, $\ell$1-norm, peak counts, Minkowski functionals, and Betti numbers) each outperform the shear 2-point correlation functions by a factor $2.5$ on the $w_0$ forecasts, with only marginal improvement when used in combination with 2-point estimators, suggesting that every HOS is able to retrieve both the non-Gaussian and Gaussian information of the matter density field. The similar performance of the different estimators\inlinecomment{, with a slight preference for Minkowski functionals and 1-point probability distribution function,} is explained by a homogeneous use of multi-scale and tomographic information, optimized to lower computational costs. These results hold for the $3$ mass mapping techniques of the \textit{Euclid} pipeline: aperture mass, Kaiser--Squires, and Kaiser--Squires plus, and are unaffected by the application of realistic star masks. Finally, we explore the use of HOSs with the Bernardeau--Nishimichi--Taruya (BNT) nulling scheme approach, finding promising results towards applying physical scale cuts to HOSs.",
New submissions,"Doubly Discordant SH0ES NGC4258 Cepheid Relations (HVI), and Impactful Extinction Laws",Daniel Majaess,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"S$H_0$ES 2016-2022 $HVI$ data for classical Cepheids in the keystone galaxy NGC4258 yield doubly discordant Wesenheit Leavitt functions:~$\Delta W_{0,H-VI} = -0.13\pm0^{m}.02$ ($-0^{m}.17$ unweighted) and that is paired with a previously noted $\Delta W_{0,I-VI}\simeq-0^{m}.3$, which in concert with complimentary evidence suggest the 2016 S$H_0$ES NGC4258-anchored $H_0 \pm \sigma_{H_0}$ warrants scrutiny (i.e., $\sigma_{H_0}/{H_0}\gtrsim 6$\%). Cepheid distance uncertainties are further exacerbated by extinction law ambiguities endemic to such Leavitt relations (e.g., NGC4258), particularly for comparatively obscured variables (e.g., $\Delta d \gtrsim 4$\%, reddened Cepheid subsamples in the Milky Way, M31, NGC2442, NGC4424, NGC5643, NGC7250). Lastly, during the analysis it was identified that the 2022 S$H_0$ES database relays incorrect SMC Cepheid photometry.",

Pereira,Andrius Tamosiunas(COMPACT Collaboration)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. In this paper we consider the non-orientable Euclidean topologies \E{7}--\E{10}, \E{13}--\E{15}, and \E{17}, encompassing the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the CMB sky. We find that in manifolds where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about $1.2$ times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB, we expect a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. Our limited selection of manifold parameters are exemplary of interesting behaviors, but not necessarily representative. Future searches for topology will require a thorough exploration of the parameter space to determine what values of the parameters predict statistical correlations that are convincingly attributable to topology.[Abridged]",
New submissions,On the sensitivity of different galaxy properties to warm dark matter,"Belén Costanza,Bonny Y. Wang,Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro,Alex M. Garcia,Jonah C. Rose,Mark Vogelsberger,Paul Torrey,Arya Farahi,Xuejian Shen,Ilem Leisher",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We study the impact of warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass on galaxy properties using 1,024 state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the DREAMS project. We begin by using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) coupled with a normalizing flow to explore global statistical descriptors of galaxy populations, such as the mean, standard deviation, and histograms of 14 galaxy properties. We find that subhalo gas mass is the most informative feature for constraining the WDM mass, achieving a determination coefficient of R^2 = 0.9. We employ symbolic regression to extract simple, interpretable relations with the WDM particle mass. Finally, we adopt a more localized approach by selecting individual dark matter halos and using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a normalizing flow to infer the WDM mass, incorporating subhalo properties as node features and global simulation statistics as graph-level features. The GNN approach yields only a residual improvement over MLP models based solely on global features, indicating that most of the predictive power resides in the global descriptors, with only marginal gains from halo-level information.",
New submissions,Spectral Properties of Anomalous Microwave Emission in 144 Galactic Clouds,"Roke Cepeda-Arroita,J. A. Rubiño-Martín,R. T. Génova-Santos,C. Dickinson,S. E. Harper,F. Poidevin,M. W.

Pearson,Angela C. Taylor,P. Vielva,R. A. Watson,Z. Zhang",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a diffuse microwave component thought to arise from spinning dust grains, yet remains poorly understood. We analyze AME in 144 Galactic clouds by combining low-frequency maps from S-PASS (2.3 GHz), C-BASS (4.76 GHz), and QUIJOTE (10-20 GHz) with 21 ancillary maps. Using aperture photometry and parametric SED fitting via MCMC methods without informative priors, we measure AME emissivity, peak frequency, and spectral width. We achieve peak frequency constraints nearly three times tighter than previous work and identify 83 new AME sources. AME spectra are generally broader than predicted by spinning dust models for a single phase of the interstellar medium, suggesting either multiple spinning dust components along the line of sight or incomplete representation of the grain size distribution in current models. However, the narrowest observed widths match theoretical predictions, supporting the spinning dust hypothesis. The AME amplitude correlates most strongly with the thermal dust peak flux and radiance, showing $\sim30$% scatter and sublinear scaling, which suggests reduced AME efficiency in regions with brighter thermal dust emission. AME peak frequency increases with thermal dust temperature in a trend current theoretical models do not reproduce, indicating that spinning dust models must incorporate dust evolution and radiative transfer in a self-consistent framework where environmental parameters and grain properties are interdependent. PAH tracers correlate with AME emissivity, supporting a physical link to small dust grains. Finally, a log-Gaussian function provides a good empirical description of the AME spectrum across the sample, given current data quality and frequency coverage.",
Cross submissions,Resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter with a refined numerical scheme,"Kentaro Kasai,Masahiro Kawasaki,Kai Murai",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The existence of a large primordial neutrino asymmetry is an intriguing possibility, both observationally and theoretically. Such an asymmetry can lead to the resonant production of $\mathrm{keV}$-scale sterile neutrinos, which are a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we comprehensively revisit the resonant production processes with a refined numerical analysis, adopting a dynamical discretization of momentum modes to take care of the sharpness of the resonance. We find parameter regions consistent with X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints for lepton-to-entropy ratio $\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ and $m_{\nu_s}\gtrsim 20$\,keV. We also explore the Affleck-Dine mechanism as a possible origin for such asymmetries. While previous studies considered resonant production after lepton number generation, we numerically investigate cases where a fraction of sterile neutrinos is produced during lepton number injection. In this regime, some parameter sets can shorten the free-streaming length and reduce the required mixing angle to match the observed dark matter abundance, thereby mitigating the observational constraints.",

Cross submissions,Gravitomagnetic-Hydrodynamics and Turbulence in Early Universe,"Jiaxiang Liang,Peng Xu,Minghui Du,Yifu Cheng,Zhan Wang,Ziren Luo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This work tries to establish the theoretical framework for gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamics (GMHD), revealing a fundamental correspondence between geometrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in general relativity. By introducing the gravitoelectromagnetic formalism to relativistic fluids, a set of leading-order GMHD equations is derived that govern the co-evolution of spacetime geometry and matter dynamics in the early Universe. This analysis reveals that, under high-temperature and high-density conditions such as those during the electroweak phase transition, the gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, leading to a strongly coupled fluid-spacetime system. This coupling supports the emergence of gravitational Alfven waves and a turbulent energy cascade. Our findings suggest that GMHD turbulence may leave imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.",

Cross submissions,Effects of the ekpyrotic mechanism on inflationary phase in loop quantum cosmologies,"Christian Brown,Jared Fier,Brian Phillips,Gerald Cleaver,Anzhong Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In bouncing cosmological models, either classical or quantum, the big bang singularity is replaced by a regular bounce. A challenging question in such models is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it is well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce, where $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to introduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes negative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar field will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter fields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe can be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects the inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation is generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases in which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary potential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the influence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in the models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during which the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem is resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the inflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an inflationary phase. This phase can last long enough to solve the cosmological problems existing in the big bang model.",
Cross submissions,A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound speed,"Shi-Cheng Liu,Lei-Hua Liu,Bichu Li,Hai-Qing Zhang,Peng-Zhang He",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.",
Cross submissions,The Wave Function of the Universe and Inflation,Gerasimos Kouniatalis,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We develop a quantum-cosmological framework in which the inflationary potential emerges from the structure of the wave function of the universe rather than being postulated. Starting from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker minisuperspace, we express the wave function in terms of an amplitude and a phase and, in a semiclassical regime where the expansion dominates the field's evolution, separate these into purely geometric and purely field-dependent pieces. This yields a closed expression for an emergent potential that makes transparent the roles of the cosmological constant, the momenta associated with expansion and field dynamics, and quantum corrections from the amplitude. Slow-roll conditions follow from properties of the phase and amplitude, leading to wave-function-level expressions for the usual slow-roll parameters and to direct links between cosmic microwave background observables and derivatives of the phase. The approach ties inflation to the quantum state of the universe and suggests testable relationships between cosmological data and features of the wave function.",
