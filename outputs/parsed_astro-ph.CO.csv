New submissions,Measuring the splashback feature: Dependence on halo properties and history,"Qiaorong S.

We use the largest simulation run in the hydrodynamic MillenniumTNG project. By stacking haloes in bins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and concentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the logarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results show that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which follows a power law $\mathcal{D}\propto\left(\log_{10}M\right)^{2.8}$. Properties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar dependence. The splashback width has the strongest dependence on halo peak height and follows a power law $\mathcal{W}\propto\nu^{-0.87}$. We provide the fitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass, redshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and width are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since they depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak height and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's assembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density profile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback features have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass accretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and width can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities like the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the halo's history and inner structure.",
New submissions,Field-level constraints on cosmic birefringence from hybrid ILC maps combining $E$- and $B$-mode channels,Mathieu Remazeilles,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Cosmic birefringence, arising from a potential parity-violating interaction between cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons and evolving pseudo-scalar fields such as axion-like particles, can rotate the CMB polarization plane and induce an effective correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-mode polarization. In this work, we introduce a hybrid internal linear combination (ILC) method that combines both $E$- and $B$-mode frequency maps into the component separation pipeline, enabling the disentanglement of correlated and uncorrelated components of CMB polarization in the presence of cosmic birefringence and instrumental polarization angle miscalibration. We derive an analytic linear relation connecting the birefringence-induced correlated component of the CMB $E$- (or $B$-) mode field to the full CMB $B$- (or $E$-) mode field convolved with a modulating field. By performing linear regression between these fields across multiple sky patches, we directly estimate the birefringence angle at the field level. This allows us to distinguish cosmic birefringence from polarization angle miscalibration and foreground contamination, as the ILC responds differently to achromatic cosmic birefringence and chromatic systematic effects, with its weights projecting spatial or harmonic dependence only onto the latter. This non-parametric, field-level approach provides a novel way to probe cosmic birefringence directly in real space. When applied to realistic simulations of the forthcoming LiteBIRD satellite mission, our method yields constraints that are competitive with, and complementary to, existing power spectrum-based analyses. When applied to Planck Release 4 (PR4) data, we find a birefringence angle of $\beta = 0.32^\circ \pm 0.12^\circ$, a $2.7\sigma$ detection that remains robust against varying sky fractions.",
New submissions,"One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters","Thomas Bakx,Mikhail M. Ivanov,Oliver H. E. Philcox,Zvonimir Vlah",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 43\%, 31\%, and 4\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.",
New submissions,Gravitational Wave Burst from Bremsstrahlung in Milky Way Can Discover Sub-Solar Dark Matter in Near Future,"Samsuzzaman Afroz,Suvodip Mukherjee",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"What is Dark Matter, and what is its concentration in the Milky Way remains an open question in physics. We show that if a significant fraction of dark matter is composed of sub-solar mass primordial black holes (PBHs), gravitational bremsstrahlung resulting from hyperbolic encounters between unbound PBHs within the galactic halos can generate distinctive chromatic gravitational-wave (GW) emission concentrated around the galactic dark matter halo, and it provides a direct window to discover such compact objects. We find that for both generalized NFW and Einasto dark matter profiles of Milky Way, the signal-to-noise ratio can be more than five in one year of observation for the upcoming ground based GW observatories Cosmic Explorer if PBH dark matter fraction $f_{\rm PBH} = 1$ over the mass range $10^{-14} M_\odot \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-8} M_\odot$. Our results show that the Galactic Center could appear as a GW-bright source, enabling new insights into dark matter and its distribution.",
New submissions,Cusp-to-Core Transition of Dark Matter Halos across Galaxy Mass Scales,"Kohei Hayashi,Yuka Kaneda,Masao Mori,Michi Shinozaki",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the diversity of dark matter (DM) density profiles in a large sample of late-type galaxies from the SPARC database, with the goal of testing whether a cusp-to-core transition occurs across galaxy mass scales. We perform Bayesian fits to high-quality rotation curves using flexible halo models that allow for variations in the inner slopes of DM density profiles. We quantify the central dark matter structure using the surface density within the inner region of the halo, defined as $\Sigma_{\rm DM}(<0.01r_{V_{\rm max}})$, and compare the SPARC galaxies with Milky Way dwarf satellites as well as galaxy groups and clusters. Our results reveal significant diversity in the inner density slopes of SPARC galaxies, ranging from steep cusps to shallow cores, and show that many of them lie below the cuspy profiles predicted by the cold dark matter model, consistent with core-like structures. In contrast, both lower-mass dwarf galaxies and higher-mass galaxy clusters tend to follow the cuspy DM halos. These findings suggest that baryonic feedback may induce a cusp-to-core transition in Milky Way-mass galaxies, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. However, observational limitations and modeling uncertainties still prevent a definitive conclusion. This study provides new empirical insights into the halo mass-dependent nature of DM inner structures and the role of baryonic processes in shaping them.",
New submissions,Prior-free cosmological parameter estimation of Cosmicflows-4,"C. Duangchan,A. Valade,N. I. Libeskind,M. Steinmetz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"As tracers of the underlying mass distributions, galaxies' peculiar velocities are valuable probes of the Universe, allowing us to measure the Hubble constant or to map the large scale structure and its dynamics. Yet, catalogs of peculiar velocities are noisy, scarce and prone to various interpretation biases. We aim to measure the bulk flow and the Hubble constant directly from the largest available sample of peculiar velocities, and without imposing a cosmological prior on the velocity field. To address these issues, we analyze the Cosmicflows-4 catalog, the most extensive catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities, reaching a redshift $z=0.1$. Specifically, we construct a forward modeling approach assuming only a flat Universe, which reconstructs the radial and bulk flows of the velocity field directly from measurements of peculiar velocities. Our method accurately recovers cosmological parameters within a radius of $120\ \mathrm{Mpc/h}$ that can then be compared with the predictions from $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$. Apart from a $3\sigma$ tension with $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ on the magnitude around $120\ \mathrm{Mpc/h}$ associated with a $4\sigma$ tension on the supergalactic $X$ direction, we find a general agreement between the standard model and the observations. Lastly, our analysis suggests a Hubble constant value of approximately $75.8\pm0.4\ \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, exacerbating (or independently confirming) the existing ``Hubble tension"", however, for the first time accomplished with the largest set of peculiar velocities in existence.",
New submissions,Primordial Power Spectrum and Bispectrum from Lattice Simulations of Axion-U(1) Inflation,"Drew Jamieson,Angelo Caravano,Eiichiro Komatsu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present primordial non-Gaussianity predictions from a new high-precision code for simulating axion-U(1) inflation on a discrete lattice. We measure the primordial scalar curvature power spectrum and bispectrum from our simulations, determining their dependence on both scale and axion-gauge coupling strength. Both the gauge-sourced power spectrum and the bispectrum exhibit a strong blue tilt due to our choice of an $\alpha$-attractor inflaton potential. We provide fitting functions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that accurately reproduce these statistics across a wide range of scales and coupling strengths. While our fitting function for the bispectrum has a separable form, results from high-resolution simulations demonstrate that the full shape is not separable. Thus, our simulations generate realizations of primordial curvature perturbations with nontrivial correlators that cannot be generated using standard techniques for primordial non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds on the axion-gauge coupling strength based on the bispectrum constraints from the cosmic microwave background, demonstrating a new method for constraining inflationary primordial non-Gaussianity by simulating the nonlinear dynamics.",
New submissions,How Holographic is the Dark Energy? A Spline Nodal reconstruction approach,"Miguel A. Zapata,Gabriela Garcia-Arroyo,Shahnawaz A. Adil,J. Alberto Vazquez",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we explore the generalized holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario. We relate the HDE density to the future-horizon scale via a function $f(a)$, which we reconstruct via spline-based nodal interpolation. We perform a Bayesian analysis to assess model's consistency with current observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Union3 and Pantheon+ compilations, and local measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, from SH0ES. We show that under specific conditions, the model reduces to $\Lambda$CDM with one node. We find strong statistical evidence against the standard HDE model $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm HDE, \; 3\text{-Node}} \sim 20$, and in contrast, the reconstructed HDE model, with three nodes, provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model, specifically, $\Delta \chi^2_{\Lambda \rm CDM, \; 3\text{-Node}} \sim 12$.",
New submissions,Darksuite: an Algorithm for Dark Matter-Admixed Neutron Stars,"Nguyen Thi Lan Anh,Peter Lott,Quynh Lan Nguyen",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational-wave observations provide a unique window into the fundamental nature of massive objects. In particular, neutron star equations of state have been constrained due to the success of gravitational wave observatories. Recently, the possibility of detecting dark matter-admixed neutron stars via ground-based laser interferometry has been explored. Dark matter would impact the gravitational waveform of an inspiraling neutron star system through tidal parameters, namely the tidal deformability ($\lambda$, incurring a phase shift to the frequency evolution of the signal. This phase shift would depend both on the percentage of dark matter within the star and its particle nature, e.g., bosonic or fermionic. Indirect detection of dark matter through admixture within neutron stars can provide insight into the neutron equation of state, as well as constraints on the density of dark matter in the universe. In this work, we introduce \texttt{Darksuite}, a proposed extension of the \lal{} software framework, designed to model the gravitational wave signatures of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars. This framework employs simulations from the two-fluid, generally relativistic Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, wherein one fluid is ordinary nuclear matter and the other is dark matter. We demonstrate interpolation of values from a bank of simulations, enabling the study of binary systems where at least one component may be a dark-matter-admixed neutron star. By leveraging existing methodologies within \lal{} for tidal phase corrections and supplementing them with dark matter effects, \texttt{Darksuite} provides a means to generate and analyze gravitational waveforms for these exotic systems.",
New submissions,Stochastic-tail of the curvature perturbation in hybrid inflation,"Tomoaki Murata,Yuichiro Tada",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation. On top of these tails, effective upper bounds on the curvature perturbation are also observed, corresponding to the exact hilltop trajectory during the waterfall phase. We find that in the model where the leading and higher-order terms in the expansion of the inflaton potential around the critical point are fine-tuned to balance, this upper bound can be significantly reduced, even smaller than the primordial black hole (PBH) threshold, as a novel perturbation-reduction mechanism than the one proposed in Ref. [1]. It makes PBH formation much difficult compared to the Gaussian or exponential-tail approximation. We also introduce Johnson's $S_U$-distribution as a useful fitting function for the PDF. It reveals a nonlinear mapping between the Gaussian field and the curvature perturbation, which enables us to apply the peak theory to estimate the PBH function.",
New submissions,Revisiting cosmic acceleration with DESI BAO,"Jincheng Wang,Hongwei Yu,Puxun Wu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We revisit the evolution of cosmic acceleration in a spatially flat $w_0w_a$CDM universe, in which the equation of state of dark energy takes the CPL parametrization, using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and several type Ia supernova datasets, including PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5. We analyze the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ and the jerk parameter $j(z)$ and further validate our results using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. Our findings indicate significant deviations from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Specifically, DESI BAO, DESI BAO + CMB, DESI BAO + CMB + Union3, and DESI BAO + CMB + DESY5 all provide strong evidence for a slowing down of cosmic acceleration at late times, as indicated by $j(0) < 0$ at more than 1$\sigma$ confidence level, within the framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These results suggest that in the $w_0w_a$CDM universe cosmic acceleration has already peaked and is now in a phase of decline.",

Terenzi,M. Tomasi,M. Tristram",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are deflected by large-scale structure through gravitational lensing. This secondary effect introduces higher-order correlations in CMB anisotropies, which are used to reconstruct lensing deflections. This allows mapping of the integrated matter distribution along the line of sight, probing the growth of structure, and recovering an undistorted view of the last-scattering surface. Gravitational lensing has been measured by previous CMB experiments, with $\textit{Planck}$'s $42\,\sigma$ detection being the current best full-sky lensing map. We present an enhanced $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ lensing map by extending the CMB multipole range and including the minimum-variance estimation, leading to a $49$ to $58\,\sigma$ detection over $80\,\%$ of the sky, depending on the final complexity of polarized Galactic emission. The combination of $\textit{Planck}$ and $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ will be the best full-sky lensing map in the 2030s, providing a $72$ to $78\,\sigma$ detection over $80\,\%$ of the sky, almost doubling $\textit{Planck}$'s sensitivity. Finally, we explore different applications of the lensing map, including cosmological parameter estimation using a lensing-only likelihood and internal delensing, showing that the combination of both experiments leads to improved constraints. The combination of $\textit{Planck}$ + $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ will improve the $S_8$ constraint by a factor of 2 compared to $\textit{Planck}$, and $\textit{Planck}$ + $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ internal delensing will improve $\textit{LiteBIRD}$'s tensor-to-scalar ratio constraint by $6\,\%$. We have tested the robustness of our results against foreground models of different complexity, showing that a significant improvement remains even for the most complex foregrounds.",

SOAP offers parallel processing capabilities via mpi4py for efficient handling of large datasets, and allows for consistent property calculation across multiple halo finders. SOAP supports various halo definitions, including spherical overdensities and fixed physical apertures, providing flexibility for diverse observational comparisons.

A statistically significant detection of any deviations would signify the presence of new physics or the breakdown of any number of the underlying assumptions of the standard cosmological model or possible systematic errors in the data. In this paper, we quantify the ability of the LSS data products of the spectroscopic survey of the Euclid mission, together with other contemporary surveys, to improve the constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the redshift range $0<z<1.75$. We consider both currently available growth rate data and simulated data with specifications from Euclid and external surveys, based on $\Lambda$CDM and a modified gravity (MoG) model with an evolving Newton's constant (denoted $\mu$CDM), and carry out a binning method and a machine learning reconstruction, based on genetic algorithms (GAs), of several LSS null tests. Using the forecast Euclid growth data from the spectroscopic survey in the range $0.95<z<1.75$, we find that in combination with external data products (covering the range $0<z<0.95$), Euclid will be able to improve on current constraints of null tests of the LSS on average by a factor of eight when using a binning method and a factor of six when using the GAs. Our work highlights the need for synergies between Euclid and other surveys, but also the usefulness of statistical analyses, such as GAs, in order to disentangle any degeneracies in the cosmological parameters. Both are necessary to provide tight constraints over an extended redshift range and to probe for deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model.",
New submissions,Biased Domain Walls and the Origin of Early Massive Structures,"Clara Winckler,Pedro P. Avelino,Lara Sousa",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Discrete symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the early universe may have caused the formation of networks of sheet-like topological defects, usually referred to as domain walls, which separate regions that have settled into different vacuum states. Field theory simulations predict the successive collapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave observable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use the parameter-free velocity-dependent one-scale model to provide an estimate of the final decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a function of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed for density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure formation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting non-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that domain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as present-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of standard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast, biased domain walls generally face much less stringent constraints on their tension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies. Based on our analysis, we are able to show that the collapse of such biased wall networks can provide a significant contribution to structure formation, and, in particular, a mass excess at $z \gtrsim 7$ as suggested by JWST data.",

Man,Carlos De Breuck,Padelis P. Papadopoulos,Paola Andreani,Thomas G. Bisbas",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We aim to characterize the multi-phase gas in the SPT2349-56 protocluster at z=4.3, known to host one of the most starbursting and AGN-rich high redshiftthis http URLthis purpose we conducted APEX single dish observations of the [CII]158 micron (hereafter [CII]) line towards the Core and North components, previously imaged with the ALMA 12-m array. We also present the first [OIII]88 micron (hereafter [OIII]) line observations in such high redshift protocluster system. We obtain a [CII] line luminosity $\sim$1.7$\times$ more than the one recovered by ALMA towards the Core, while remarkably we recover 4$\times$ more [CII] line emission than the one found in deep ALMA images towards the North component, suggesting that the most massive gas reservoirs lie in the less extreme regions of this protocluster system. A minimum ionised gas mass of $\mathrm M_{\rm min}(H^+)$$ \sim$$3.7\times 10^{10}$\,\Msun\, is deduced from the [OIII] line, amounting to 30\% of the molecular gas mass in the same area. Finally we obtain star formation rate (SFR) estimates using the [OIII] line luminosity, and the corresponding ionised gas mass. These yield values that can surpass the far-IR continuum-derived SFR (under the assumption of a standard stellar IMF), which can be reconciled only if non-stellar ionising sources contribute to the [OIII] line luminosity, or a top-heavy stellar IMF produces a larger fraction of O stars per total stellar mass, a distinct possibility in High-Energy-Particle (HEP) rather than (UV-photon)-dominated environments in clusters. Future work using far-IR fine-structure and molecular/neutral-atomic lines is necessary for determining the thermal/ionisation states of the multi-phase medium and these line ratios must be measured over a wide range of spatial scales, which ultimately requires combining wide-field single-dish and high resolution interferometric observations.",

First, we use pairs or trios of datasets where we exclude one type of datasets each time and categorize them as ``NO SN"", ``NO CMB"" and ``NO BAO"" combinations. In all cases, we find that the combinations favor the $w_0 w_a$CDM model over $\Lambda$CDM, with significance ranging from 2.3$\sigma$ to 3.3$\sigma$. For example, DESI+DESY6BAO+CMB yields 3.2$\sigma$ without SN, DESI+DESY6BAO+DESY5SN yields 3.3$\sigma$ without CMB, and CMB+DESY5SN+DES3x2pts yields 2.6$\sigma$ without BAO. The persistence of this pattern across various dataset combinations even when any of the dataset is excluded supports an overall validation of this trending result regardless of any specific dataset. Next, we use larger combinations of these datasets after verifying their mutual consistency within the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We find combinations that give significance levels $\sim$4$\sigma$, with DESI+DESY6BAO+CMBL+DESY5SN reaching 4.4$\sigma$. In sum, while we need to remain prudent, the combination of the first step that supports a validation of the pattern of these results beyond any single type of datasets and their associated systematics, together with the second step showing high-significance results when such datasets are combined, presents a compelling overall portrait in favor of a dynamical dark energy with a time-evolving equation of state over a cosmological constant, and constitutes a serious challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model's reign.

Cross submissions,Field theory vacuum and entropic dark energy models,Michael Maziashvili,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the cosmological implications of a novel definition of field theory vacuum energy. The free field Hamiltonian represented as an ensemble of oscillators (in the Fourier space) usually implies the presence of mass scale for these oscillators, which in quantum field theory is of little importance since quantum energy spectrum of oscillator is mass independent. This mass scale, however, may be interesting due to its possible gravitational implications. Since black hole physics puts an upper limit on the total energy within a given region, one obtains constraint on the number of field oscillators. If the mass scale for field oscillators is set by the IR cutoff, then this number saturates the black hole entropy bound. Following this reasoning, one derives various kinds of dark energy models that maybe interesting for further study.",
Cross submissions,Supernova cooling from neutrino-devouring dark matter,"Yugen Lin,Chih-Ting Lu,Ningqiang Song",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Supernova cooling provides a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), in particular for new, light states interacting feebly with SM particles. In this work, we investigate for the first time the production of fermionic dark matter (DM) via the neutrino-devouring process inside a core-collapse supernova, which contributes to the excessive cooling. By incorporating state-of-the-art supernova simulation data and the full time evolution information, we derive stringent and robust limits on DM interactions. We exclude the cross sections down to $10^{-51}-10^{-58}$ cm$^2$ in the keV-MeV mass range for DM-electron scattering, and $10^{-49}-10^{-56}$ cm$^2$ in the 0.1-100 MeV mass range for DM-nucleon scattering, supplemented by complementary constraints from cosmology, astrophysics, LHC and direct detection experiments in the larger cross section regime. We also close almost the entire window in which fermionic DM constitutes $\mathcal{O}(1)$ fraction of DM for its coupling to electrons in the keV-MeV mass range.",
Cross submissions,Gravitons and Temperature Fluctuation Correlations from Inflation,"L. H. Ford,I-Tai Ho,Chun-Hsien Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Inflationary tensor perturbations are treated as arising from a bath of gravitons produced by quantum particle creation at the end of inflation. We calculate the correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations produced by these gravitons in a model with an infrared cut off. The CMB photons are emitted from within a last scattering shell of finite thickness in redshift. We find the correlation function in terms of the separation of a pair of spacetime points of emission in both angle and redshift. In both variables, there is a significant amount of anti-correlation. The anti-correlation minimum has a relative magnitude compared to the central correlation maximum of about 20% in angle and 50% in redshift.",
Cross submissions,From Capture to Collapse: Revisiting Black Hole formation by Fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter in Neutron Stars,"Sandra Robles,Drona Vatsyayan,Giorgio Busoni",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can be captured in neutron stars (NSs) via scatterings with the star constituents. The absence of dark matter annihilation due to its asymmetric nature leads to ADM accumulation in the NS core, potentially reaching densities sufficient to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and trigger its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH), eventually consuming the NS from within. Therefore, the existence and observation of old neutron stars provides a means to constrain the properties of ADM. We revisit previous constraints on the mass and scattering cross section off neutrons of fermionic ADM across a class of models. We critically examine common simplifying approximations used in the literature to derive these limits. Our analysis includes improved treatments of dark matter capture, thermalization, BH formation, accretion, and evaporation. We find that previous results can be relaxed by a few orders of magnitude once these effects are properly accounted for.",
