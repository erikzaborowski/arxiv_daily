New submissions,Efficient neutral-IGM inference from noisy 21-cm forest spectra with latent-space U-Net encoding and XGBoost,"Sameer K. Patil,Tomáš Šoltinský,Soumak Maitra,Girish Kulkarni",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The 21-cm forest, comprising narrow absorption features imprinted on the radio spectra of high-redshift radio-loud quasars by intervening neutral hydrogen, offers a uniquely sensitive probe of the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization. Although over 30 such quasars are now known at $z > 5.5$, the signal remains elusive in practice, owing to instrumental noise, the intrinsic weakness of the absorption features, and the limited brightness of available background sources. Recent studies have focused on the one-dimensional transmission power spectrum as a statistical observable, but this approach also demands high signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we present a systematic comparison of five inference pipelines for recovering IGM parameters from mock 21-cm forest spectra at $z = 6$, incorporating realistic instrumental noise and telescope characteristics. We show that likelihood-free inference based on machine learning substantially outperforms traditional Bayesian methods. In particular, our most effective method dispenses with the power spectrum entirely: we use a convolutional U-Net to extract a latent-space encoding of the input spectrum and perform parameter regression using XGBoost. This approach yields accurate constraints on the IGM neutral fraction and X-ray heating efficiency even with a single 50-hour uGMRT sightline, which is an orders-of-magnitude improvement in integration time relative to existing techniques. We publicly release our code, training data, and models. Beyond the 21-cm forest, these results underscore the promise of hybrid deep learning and gradient-boosted inference techniques for extracting physical information from low-SNR data across astrophysics.",
New submissions,"Identifying a protocluster formation at z $\sim$ 4.5 in the COSMOS field: an extension of Taralay protocluster, traced by Ly-alpha emitters surrounding a submm galaxy","Mariana Rubet,Karín Menéndez-Delmestre,Thiago Signorini Gonçalves,Felipe Almeida-Fernandes,Luidhy Santana-Silva,Peter L. Capak,Kartik Sheth",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We report the discovery of a large-scale structure containing multiple overdensities at $z= 4.54 \pm 0.03$ in the COSMOS field, with the most prominent one likely infalling towards the recently identified Taralay protocluster. We use combined wide-band and narrow-band optical photometry to identify Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) within a 21 cMpc radius from the submm source J1000+0234, at $z= 4.54$, to identify typical star-forming galaxies that may trace an underlying structure. Our approach selects line emitters as narrow-band excess objects and we use the COSMOS2020 photometric redshift catalog to eliminate potential low-redshift interlopers whose line emission (e.g. [OIII] at $z\sim 0.3$) might be responsible for the observed excess in the narrow band. In comparison with the LAE density in the field, our results point to a mean LAE number overdensity of $\bar\delta = 3$ spanning a region of $27 \times 20 \times 36$ cMpc$^3$, probably evolving into a moderate-mass cluster ($3 - 10 \times 10^{14} \, M_\odot$) at $z\sim 0$. This work supports the idea that submm sources, although offset from the major overdensity peaks, serve as traces of moderately massive, potentially infalling structures.",
New submissions,Comparing the Spatial Correlation of Binary Black Hole Mergers to Large-Scale Structure through the Illustris Simulation,"Shaniya Jarrett,Kelly Holley-Bockelmann,Robert J. Scherrer",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational waves (GWs) have provided a new lens through which to view the universe beyond traditional electromagnetic methods. The upcoming space-based gravitational wave mission, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will give us the first glimpse of the sky in mHz gravitational waves, a waveband that contains a rich variety of sources including massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers. In this work, we investigate the spatial distribution of MBBH mergers versus the galaxy distribution to determine how well LISA could be used as a unique and independent probe of large-scale structure. We compare the two-point correlation function (2pt CF) of MBBH mergers to that of galaxies within the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG. Our results show that MBBH mergers exhibit stronger clustering than galaxies at scales less than 10 Mpc $h^{-1}$, particularly at higher redshifts, and that the bias is relatively constant as a function of separation. These findings imply that the spatial distribution of MBBH mergers detectable by LISA could inform the observed galaxy distribution. In addition, this implies that searches for a cosmological background in LISA data could use a prior derived from large-scale structure observations to subtract the MBBH foreground.",
New submissions,Can a multi-tracer approach improve the constraints on the turnover scale?,"Yan Lai,Cullan Howlett,Tamara Davis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The turnover scale of the power spectrum is related to the size of the particle horizon at the matter-radiation equality, which can be used as a standard ruler to constrain cosmological parameters. In this work, we apply a model-independent method to mock datasets to forecast constraints on the turnover scale below a redshift of 0.5, investigating for the first time with a multi-tracer approach. We find that combining the galaxy density with peculiar velocity does not improve the turnover scale constraints for current or currently planned surveys because either the cosmological volume or the effective number density of peculiar velocities is too low. However, we demonstrate that when combining the galaxy power spectrum from 4HS with the HI power spectrum from SKA1-B2, the constraints on the turnover scale improve by $\sim30\%$ compared to using only a single tracer. We demonstrate for the first time that combining DESI, 4HS, and an SKA Phase 1 Band 2 survey could achieve a $\sim5\%$ level constraint on the turnover scale and a $\sim90\%$ probability of detecting the turnover below a redshift of 0.5. Lastly, we also demonstrate that combining the DESI BGS redshift sample with the LRG, ELG, and QSO samples could break the degeneracy between $r_H$ and $\Omega_m$ and improve their constraints by $\sim25\%$ and $\sim45\%$, respectively, compared to only using the high redshift samples. The constraints on the particle horizon at the matter-radiation equality $r_H$ and the matter density $\Omega_m$ could then further improve by $\sim20\%$ and $\sim30\%$, respectively, when combining the full set of DESI redshift tracers with 4HS and SKA1-B2.",
New submissions,CosmoFlow: Scale-Aware Representation Learning for Cosmology with Flow Matching,"Sidharth Kannan,Tian Qiu,Carolina Cuesta-Lazaro,Haewon Jeong",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Generative machine learning models have been demonstrated to be able to learn low dimensional representations of data that preserve information required for downstream tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that flow matching based generative models can learn compact, semantically rich latent representations of field level cold dark matter (CDM) simulation data without supervision. Our model, CosmoFlow, learns representations 32x smaller than the raw field data, usable for field level reconstruction, synthetic data generation, and parameter inference. Our model also learns interpretable representations, in which different latent channels correspond to features at different cosmological scales.",
New submissions,Euclid preparation. Simulating thousands of Euclid spectroscopic skies,Euclid Collaboration,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present two extensive sets of 3500+1000 simulations of dark matter haloes on the past light cone, and two corresponding sets of simulated (`mock') galaxy catalogues that represent the Euclid spectroscopic sample. The simulations were produced with the latest version of the PINOCCHIO code, and provide the largest, public set of simulated skies. Mock galaxy catalogues were obtained by populating haloes with galaxies using an halo occupation distribution (HOD) model extracted from the Flagship galaxy catalogue provided by Euclid Collaboration. The Geppetto set of 3500 simulated skies was obtained by tiling a 1.2 Gpc/h box to cover a light-cone whose sky footprint is a circle of 30 deg radius, for an area of 2763 deg$^2$ and a minimum halo mass of $1.5\times10^{11}$ Msun/h. The relatively small box size makes this set unfit for measuring very large scales. The EuclidLargeBox set consists of 1000 simulations of 3.38 Gpc/h, with the same mass resolution and a footprint that covers half of the sky, excluding the Milky Way zone of avoidance. From this we produced a set of 1000 EuclidLargeMocks on the 30 deg radius footprint, whose comoving volume is fully contained in the simulation box. We validated the two sets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point correlation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is consistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although we noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc. We show cosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that using one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock produces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample variance. These simulated skies will be used for the galaxy clustering analysis of Euclid's Data Release 1 (DR1).",
New submissions,No evidence for Keplerian taper of far-out galactic rotation,"Adriana Bariego-Quintana,Felipe J. Llanes-Estrada",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a statistical analysis of the 175 SPARC galactic rotation curves to test the hypothesis of whether the Keplerian velocity tapering at large radii ($v(r)\propto 1/\sqrt{r}$) of the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo model agrees with observational data. The null hypothesis is Rubin's flat-rotation curve, $v(r)=\text{constant}$ -such as can be obtained from a spherical, isothermal-like density profile, or alternatively with a very prolate halo-. To decide whether we adopt the null (Rubin behaviour) or alternative (NFW behaviour) hypothesis, we evaluate the derivative in each galaxy of $v(r)$ with its last data points. We conclude that the data is presently compatible with the null hypothesis -no taper off, no decline of $v(r)$ is seen.",
New submissions,Measuring the IGM correlation length at 5<z<6.1: a fast change at the end of Reionization,"Benedetta Spina,Sarah E. I. Bosman,Barun Maity,Frederick B. Davies",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of high redshift quasars is a powerful probe of the late stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), particularly through the presence of Gunn-Peterson troughs. These troughs span a broad range of lengths (up to $\sim 100$ Mpc), suggesting large-scale coherent structures in the intergalactic medium. We aim to gain insight into the presence, extent, and magnitude of correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at $5<z<6.1$, and to quantify the scales over which correlations are significant to inform on the necessary volume for simulating the EoR. Using the extended XQR-30 dataset and accounting for the relevant systematics, we compute the flux correlation matrix and perform an MCMC analysis to quantify the extent and strength of the correlation. To interpret our results, we compare to $1.5^3,\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ lightcones of Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission fluxes from several reionization scenarios, including a fiducial box employing SCRIPT. We detect strong correlations at $z > 5.3$, extending at least tens of Mpc and strongly increasing with redshift. Our results suggest a redshift-dependent correlation length, from $L \leq 26.53\, (68.47)$ Mpc at 1-$\sigma$ (2-$\sigma$) limit at $z = 5.0$ to $L = 252.72^{+272.61}_{-41.61}$ Mpc at $z = 6.1$. In contrast, all simulation models predict shorter correlation lengths ($< 60$ Mpc) and a slower redshift evolution. The presence and redshift-dependence of correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest on $>200$ Mpc scales at $z=6$ indicates that cosmological simulations should be larger than this scale to adequately sample the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Despite implementing a fluctuating UVB and numerous neutral islands at $z<6$, our fiducial SCRIPT-based simulation fails to reproduce the large-scale correlations. It may be that those ingredients are necessary, but not sufficient, to understanding the unfolding of the EoR.",
New submissions,Cosmic Cartography II: completing galaxy catalogs for gravitational-wave cosmology,"Konstantin Leyde,Tessa Baker,Wolfgang Enzi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The dark siren method exploits the complementarity between gravitational-wave binary coalescence signals and galaxy catalogs originating from the same regions of space. However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation.",
New submissions,Quantum estimation of cosmological parameters,"Michał Piotrak,Thomas Colas,Ana Alonso-Serrano,Alessio Serafini",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the mechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the extent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we apply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the squeezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of inflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of inflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for exponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.",
New submissions,First Constraints from Marked Angular Power Spectra with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey First-Year Data,"Jessica A. Cowell,Joaquin Armijo,Leander Thiele,Gabriela A. Marques,Camila P. Novaes,Daniela Grandón,Sihao Cheng,Masato Shirasaki,David Alonso,Jia Liu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present the first application of marked angular power spectra to weak lensing data, using maps from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 1 (HSC-Y1) survey. Marked convergence fields, constructed by weighting the convergence field with non-linear functions of its smoothed version, are designed to encode higher-order information while remaining computationally tractable. Using simulations tailored to the HSC-Y1 data, we test three mark functions that up- or down-weight different density environments. Our results show that combining multiple types of marked auto- and cross-spectra improves constraints on the clustering amplitude parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ by $\approx$43\% compared to standard two-point power spectra. When applied to the HSC-Y1 data, this translates into a constraint on $S_8 = 0.807\pm 0.024$. We assess the sensitivity of the marked power spectra to systematics, including baryonic effects, intrinsic alignment, photometric redshifts, and multiplicative shear bias. These results demonstrate the promise of marked statistics as a practical and powerful tool for extracting non-Gaussian information from weak lensing surveys.",
New submissions,Cosmological neutrino mass: a frequentist overview in light of DESI,"D. Chebat,C. Yèche,E. Armengaud,N. Schöneberg,M. Walther,A. de Mattia,J. Rohlf,J. Aguilar,S. Ahlen,D. Bianchi,D.

Prada,I. Pérez-Ràfols,G. Rossi,E. Sanchez,D. Schlegel,J. Silber,D. Sprayberry,G. Tarlé,B. A. Weaver,P. Zarrouk,R. Zhou,H. Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We derive constraints on the neutrino mass using a variety of recent cosmological datasets, including DESI BAO, the full-shape analysis of the DESI matter power spectrum and the one-dimensional power spectrum of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (P1D) from eBOSS quasars as well as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The constraints are obtained in the frequentist formalism by constructing profile likelihoods and applying the Feldman-Cousins prescription to compute confidence intervals. This method avoids potential prior and volume effects that may arise in a comparable Bayesian analysis. Parabolic fits to the profiles allow one to distinguish changes in the upper limits from variations in the constraining power $\sigma$ of the different data combinations. We find that all profiles in the $\Lambda$CDM model are cut off by the $\sum m_\nu \geq 0$ bound, meaning that the corresponding parabolas reach their minimum in the unphysical sector. The most stringent 95% C.L. upper limit is obtained by the combination of DESI DR2 BAO, Planck PR4 and CMB lensing at 53 meV, below the minimum of 59 meV set by the normal ordering. Extending $\Lambda$CDM to non-zero curvature and $w_0w_\mathrm{a}$CDM relaxes the constraints past 59 meV again, but only $w_0w_\mathrm{a}$CDM exhibits profiles with a minimum at a positive value. Using a combination of DESI DR1 full-shape, BBN and eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ P1D, we successfully constrain the neutrino mass independently of the CMB. This combination yields $\sum m_\nu \leq 285$ meV (95% C.L.). The addition of DESI full-shape or Lyman-$\alpha$ P1D to CMB and DESI BAO results in small but noticeable improvement of the constraining power of the data. Lyman-$\alpha$ free-streaming measurements especially improve the constraint. Since they are based on eBOSS data, this sets a promising precedent for upcoming DESI data.",
New submissions,The BAO-CMB Tension and Implications for Inflation,"Elisa G. M. Ferreira,Evan McDonough,Lennart Balkenhol,Renata Kallosh,Lloyd Knox,Andrei Linde",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The scalar spectral index $n_s$ is a powerful test of inflationary models. The tightest constraint on $n_s$ to date derives from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. The resulting $n_s$ constraint is shifted significantly upward relative to the constraint from CMB alone, with the consequence that previously preferred inflationary models are seemingly disfavored by $\gtrsim 2 \sigma$. Here we show that this shift in $n_s$ is the combined effect of a degeneracy between $n_s$ and BAO parameters exhibited by CMB data and the tension between CMB datasets and DESI BAO data under the assumption of the standard cosmological model. Given the crucial role of $n_s$ in discriminating between inflationary models, we urge caution in interpreting CMB+BAO constraints on $n_s$ until the BAO-CMB tension is resolved.",
Cross submissions,Dynamical Shortcomings in the Generalized SU(2) Proca Theory: Challenges for Cosmic Acceleration,"Santiago Garcia-Serna(1),J. Bayron Orjuela-Quintana(1),Yeinzon Rodriguez(2,3),Gabriel Gomez(4),Cesar A. Valenzuela-Toledo(1) ((1) Universidad del Valle, (2) Universidad Antonio Narino, (3) Universidad Industrial de Santander, (4) Universidad Mayor)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Generalized SU(2) Proca (GSU2P) theory has recently garnered attention for its potential to describe key phases of cosmic evolution, including primordial inflation and late-time accelerated expansion. However, its full cosmological implications remain unexplored. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the dynamical properties of the GSU2P theory in a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime, through a dynamical-system approach. Our analysis reveals the presence of three pairs of fixed points, one of them corresponding to de-Sitter expansion which may represent either a stable or unstable phase in the evolution of the universe. These points, nonetheless, give rise to an indeterminate or infinite Hubble parameter, which renders them cosmologically unviable. Additionally, we find two key pseudostationary states: the ``attractor lines'', along which the system exhibits constant-roll dynamics, and the ``central zone'', characterized by oscillatory radiation-like behaviour of the field. The dynamics within the central zone could represent a graceful exit from the primordial inflationary phase to a radiation dominated phase, or a state of the dark energy component prior to the late-time cosmic acceleration. However, within the central zone, the dynamics of the vector field leads to recurrent instances of a nonphysical expansion rate. The absence of a limit cycle in the central zone further exacerbates the issue, as the system may follow unbounded phase-space trajectories, and the expansion rate becomes complex once it escapes the region. Collectively, these challenges undermine the viability of the GSU2P theory as a cosmological model for cosmic acceleration.",
Cross submissions,Road through Dark$ν$ess: Probing dark matter-neutrino interactions using KM3-230213A,"Ranjini Mondol,Subhadip Bouri,Akash Kumar Saha,Ranjan Laha",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"KM3NeT has recently reported an event where a muon of energy $120^{+110}_{-60}$ PeV was observed at its ARCA detector, which can stem from a very high-energy neutrino interaction in the vicinity of the detector. Besides revolutionizing our understanding of high-energy neutrino sources, this event can serve as a valuable probe for studying Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) interactions of neutrinos. In this work, we study the dark matter (DM)-neutrino interaction by assuming the neutrino for the event KM3-230213A is originated from a blazar. The flux of such neutrinos, traveling through DM distributed across astrophysical and cosmological scales, can get attenuated due to DM interactions. The detection of such event by KM3NeT allows us to place constraints on the interaction cross section at highest-ever neutrino energy. We derive both conservative constraints-neglecting flux attenuation from the host halo-and optimistic ones by including host halo contributions. Our results show that the energy-independent constraints are weaker than previous bounds. For energy-dependent case, the extreme energy of the event allows us to set some of the strongest limits on scattering cross sections. In future, more such neutrino events with well-understood origin will be essential in constraining or potentially discovering DM-neutrino interactions.",
Cross submissions,Why did the dark matter hypothesis supersede modified gravity in the 1980s?,Antonis Antoniou,History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"In the 1960s and 1970s a series of observations and theoretical developments highlighted the presence of several anomalies which could, in principle, be explained by postulating one of the following two working hypotheses: (i) the existence of dark matter, or (ii) the modification of standard gravitational dynamics in low accelerations. In the years that followed, the dark matter hypothesis as an explanation for dark matter phenomenology attracted far more attention compared to the hypothesis of modified gravity, and the latter is largely regarded today as a non-viable alternative. The present article takes an integrated history and philosophy of science approach in order to identify the reasons why the scientific community mainly pursued the dark matter hypothesis in the years that followed, as opposed to modified gravity. A plausible answer is given in terms of three epistemic criteria for the pursuitworthiness of a hypothesis: (a) its problem-solving potential, (b) its compatibility with established theories and the feasibility of incorporation, and (c) its independent testability. A further comparison between the problem of dark matter and the problem of dark energy is also presented, explaining why in the latter case the situation is different, and modified gravity is still considered a viable possibility.",

Cross submissions,Electromagnetic Dirac Cogenesis,"Debasish Borah,Arnab Dasgupta",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a novel cogenesis mechanism by utilising the two-body decay of heavy vector-like fermions to dark matter (DM) $\chi$ and right chiral part of light Dirac neutrino $\nu_R$ via the electromagnetic dipole operator. This leads to generation of asymmetry in dark fermion $\chi$ as well as $\nu_R$ with the latter getting transferred to left-handed lepton doublets via Yukawa interactions with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. While lepton asymmetry is converted into baryon asymmetry of the Universe via electroweak sphalerons, the dark fermion asymmetry results in asymmetric dark matter. Since CP asymmetries in lepton and dark sector are equal and opposite due to net lepton number conservation, DM mass is restricted to a fixed value $\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV. Long-lived nature of DM keeps indirect detection prospects at gamma-ray telescopes alive while thermalised light Dirac neutrinos lead to observable dark radiation at cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. Heavy vector-like fermions can be probed at terrestrial experiments via their electromagnetic dipole interactions.",

It has been shown in previous studies that the presence of the operators consisting of torsion components up to dimension four can naturally induce a (pseudo-)scalar degree of freedom, the scalaron. In this work, we consider the couplings between torsion and matter currents in this framework, and show that they can lead to couplings between these currents and the scalaron in the equivalent metric theory. We consider both gauge-invariant and gauge-dependent currents, showing general results and several concrete examples. These results are useful for the discussion of particle production processes after inflation in the EC framework, such as reheating and baryogenesis, and show the connection to the QCD $\theta$ term.",
Cross submissions,Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry in a Rotating Universe I: Conceptual Foundations and the Dirac Field in Bianchi IX Geometry,Tatevik Vardanyan,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the highly symmetric FLRW geometry, has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations. However, it faces unresolved issues, including CMB anomalies, the nature of dark matter, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. These challenges highlight the limitations of the standard framework and raise questions about the validity of the assumed isotropic background geometry. A natural direction is to explore more general cosmological models that relax this assumption, potentially offering new insights into these problems. In this work, we examine a geometric approach to investigating the matter-antimatter asymmetry, grounded not in physics beyond the Standard Model, but in the structure of spacetime itself. While related questions have been raised previously in specific contexts, here we focus on the Bianchi IX cosmological model, motivated by its relevance to early-universe dynamics through the BKL conjecture and its potential role in generating angular momentum via global rotation. We study the Dirac spinor field in this background and derive the corresponding Dirac equation. Our goal is to investigate how spatial anisotropies and rotation can induce spectral asymmetries between particles and antiparticles. This paper lays the groundwork for a follow-up study analyzing specific solutions and their physical implications on matter-antimatter asymmetry.",
Cross submissions,Bias with a Timer: Axion Domain Wall Decay and Dark Matter,"Sally Yuxuan Hao,Shota Nakagawa,Yuichiro Nakai,Motoo Suzuki",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore the interplay of the post-inflationary QCD axion and a light scalar field for the axion domain wall decay and dark matter (DM). The scalar field possesses a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation, so that its interaction with the axion effectively serves as an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) violating term. At a temperature below the PQ phase transition, the effective PQ violating interaction generates the axion potential which generally contains multiple degenerate vacua leading to the formation of the axion string-domain wall networks. The following QCD phase transition provides another contribution to the axion potential making domain walls decay before they dominate the Universe. Later, the scalar field starts to relax to the minimum of its potential with a vanishing VEV, turning off the effective PQ violating interaction so that the axion potential is aligned with the QCD vacuum. We keep track of the evolution of the axion-scalar system and discuss the production of the axion DM through the domain wall decay and the (trapped) misalignment. We find that the string-wall network in some cases can decay due to its structural instability, rather than the volume pressure, and the correct axion DM abundance is realized with the decay constant larger than that of the conventional post-inflationary QCD axion without fine tuning.",
Cross submissions,No Hiding in the Dark: Cosmological Bounds on Heavy Neutral Leptons with Dark Decay Channels,"P. S. Bhupal Dev,Quan-feng Wu,Xun-Jie Xu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are well-motivated new physics candidates. The mixing of sub-GeV HNLs with active neutrinos is severely constrained by cosmology. In particular, the success of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) requires the HNL lifetime to be shorter than about 0.02 sec if they were in thermal equilibrium, thus excluding a wide range of mixing angles accessible to terrestrial experiments. In order to justify the laboratory searches in this cosmologically-forbidden region, it is often argued that adding new dark sector decay modes of HNLs can evade the stringent BBN constraint. Here we rule out this possibility and show that, contrary to the naive expectation, HNLs with significant dark decay modes actually lead to stronger cosmological bounds. This is mainly because of the increase in the extra radiation energy density in the Universe around the BBN epoch, which causes observable effects in the primordial helium fraction and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Our result has major implications for laboratory searches of HNLs.",
Cross submissions,Do Cosmic String Segments Emit Gravitational Waves?,"Akifumi Chitose,Masahiro Ibe,Shunsuke Neda,Satoshi Shirai",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Cosmic strings are predicted in various extensions of the Standard Model, including grand unified theories. Depending on the symmetry-breaking pattern, they can be either topologically stable or metastable. Intriguingly, metastable strings have been proposed as a possible origin of the gravitational wave (GW) background observed by recent pulsar timing array experiments. When metastable strings decay, they fragment into segments with monopoles and antimonopoles attached at their endpoints. The monopole and antimonopole are strongly pulled by the string tension. Violent oscillations of these segments have been considered as a potential GW source, in addition to contributions from string loops. We show that, in realistic situations, the monopoles frequently collide with thermal fluctuations on the string segments, which act as a resistance and prevent the oscillation. As a result, we find that the contribution from string segments to the GW background is negligible.",
