New submissions,Deep Learning for CMB Foreground Removal and Beam Deconvolution: A U-Net GAN Approach,"Obasho M,Shambhavi Jaiswal,Santanu Das,Krishna Mohan Parattu",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Extracting cosmological information from microwave sky observations requires accurate estimation of the underlying Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by removing foreground contamination, instrumental noise, and the effects of beam convolution. In this work, we develop a machine learning-based approachfor CMB reconstruction using a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, where the generator is modeled as a U-Net-based convolutional neural network. To train the network, we generate realistic microwave sky maps by simulating Planck-like observations: scanning HEALPix-simulated skies with real Planck beam profile, actual scan patterns, and anisotropic noise consistent with Planck data. Our method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction, with the difference between the input and recovered maps being less than $2\mu\mathrm{K}$ (approximately $1\%$) outside the Galactic region. Even within the Galactic plane, the reconstruction error remains below $2-3\%$ in most areas, except for a few isolated pixels. Most importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that a GAN-based method can effectively correct for both foreground contamination and the systematic effects of non-circular beams and the asymmetric Planck scan pattern. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for robust and accurate recovery of the CMB signal, even in the presence of strong astrophysical foregrounds and instrumental systematics.",
New submissions,A generalized study of linear electromagnetic cascades in astrophysical sources,"Damiano F. G. Fiorillo,Federico Testagrossa,Chengchao Yuan,Maria Petropoulou,Walter Winter",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"High-energy gamma rays can trigger electromagnetic cascades via pair production on ambient photons, reprocessing their energy to lower frequencies. A classic example is the cascade from the gamma rays produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in extragalactic photon fields, whose universal spectral shape was first described by Berezinsky in the 1970s. Recently, internal cascades, developing within the gamma-ray sources themselves, have gained a prominent role, as the IceCube data suggest that most detected neutrinos originate in gamma-ray-opaque environments. We analyze under what conditions these internal cascades can approach a universal spectrum. Since the Berezinsky treatment breaks down if synchrotron losses dominate, we present a generalized theory incorporating synchrotron-dominated cascades. We show the emergence of universal cascade spectrum among various examples of high-energy sources containing non-thermal cosmic rays, and discuss the conditions for its appearance.",
New submissions,Quasar Radiative Feedback May Suppress Galaxy Growth on Intergalactic Scales at $z = 6.3$,"Yongda Zhu,Eiichi Egami,Xiaohui Fan,Fengwu Sun,George D.

Rieke,Pierluigi Rinaldi,Yang Sun,Wei Leong Tee,Feige Wang,Jinyi Yang,Minghao Yue,Junyu Zhang",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present observational evidence that intense ionizing radiation from a luminous quasar suppresses nebular emission in nearby galaxies on intergalactic scales at $z=6.3$. Using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the SAPPHIRES and EIGER programs, we identify a pronounced decline in [O III] $\lambda5008$ luminosity relative to the UV continuum ($L_{5008}/L_{1500}$) among galaxies within $\sim$10 comoving Mpc (cMpc) of the quasar J0100$+$2802, the most UV-luminous quasar known at this epoch ($M_{1450}=-29.26$). While $L_{1500}$ remains roughly constant with transverse distance, $L_{5008}$ increases significantly, suggesting suppression of very recent star formation toward the quasar. The effect persists after controlling for completeness, local density, and UV luminosity, and correlates with the projected photoionization-rate profile $\Gamma_{\mathrm{qso}}$. A weaker but directionally consistent suppression in $L_{5008}/L_{1500}$ is also observed along the line of sight. The transverse suppression radius ($\sim$8-10 cMpc) implies a recent radiative episode with a cumulative duration $\sim$4.5 Myr, shorter than required for thermal photoheating to dominate and thus more naturally explained by rapid H$_2$ photodissociation and related radiative processes. Environmental effects alone appear insufficient to explain the signal. Our results provide direct, geometry-based constraints on large-scale quasar radiative feedback and recent quasar lifetimes.",
New submissions,Signals of Bursts from the Very Early Universe,"Leo Stodolsky,J. Silk",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We consider possible observable signals from explosive events in the very early universe, ``bursts"". These could be expected in connectionwith massive black hole or ``baby universe'' formation. We anticipate that such major disruptions of spacetime would be associated withneutrino and perhaps other pulses. While these seem to be notdetectable directly, we discuss how they could lead to potentially observable signals. We analyze how the pulses from very early timesmay ``escape'', that ispropagate to the last scattering epoch at the time $t_{cmb}$ and later,or alternatively be absorbed earlier, ``contained''. The possibly detectable signals include effects on small regions of the CMB, a soft x-ray resulting from positron production, or a nonthermal addition tothe relic neutrino background.",
New submissions,Looking beyond lambda,"Alexie Leauthaud,Adam Riess",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Widening cracks are appearing in the $\Lambda$CDM model and it is becoming increasingly clear that the standard cosmological model struggles to describe the full expansion history of the Universe as revealed by the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and locally calibrated Type Ia supernovae. Taken at face value, recent results suggest a dark sector that may be more complex than commonly assumed. We must prepare for the possibility of moving beyond the $\Lambda$CDM era, where merely testing $w=-1$ is no longer sufficient, and embrace the challenge of unraveling the physics of dark matter, dark energy and gravity on cosmic scales. Guided by increasingly robust data - secured through considerable investment - we should pursue deeper understanding while being open to complexity in the dark sector, rather than settling for the simplest phenomenology. New data from new facilities and a new dark energy task force could help illuminate the path forward while changes to our scientific practices will be essential to navigate the potentially rocky road ahead.",

Watson,Xin Wang,Zhuyun Zhuang",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"During the second half of Cycle 1 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we conducted the Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE) program. PASSAGE received the largest allocation of JWST observing time in Cycle 1, 591 hours of NIRISS observations to obtain direct near-IR imaging and slitless spectroscopy. About two thirds of these were ultimately executed, to observe 63 high-latitude fields in Pure Parallel mode. These have provided more than ten thousand near-infrared grism spectrograms of faint galaxies.PASSAGE brings unique advantages in studying galaxy evolution: A) Unbiased spectroscopic search, without prior photometric pre-selection. By including the most numerous galaxies, with low masses and strong emission lines, slitless spectroscopy is the indispensable complement to any pre-targeted spectroscopy; B) The combination of several dozen independent fields to overcome cosmic variance; C) Near-infrared spectral coverage, often spanning the full range from 1.0--2.3 $\mu$m, with minimal wavelength gaps, to measure multiple diagnostic rest-frame optical lines, minimizing sensitivity to dust reddening; D) JWST's unprecedented spatial resolution, in some cases using two orthogonal grism orientations, to overcome contamination due to blending of overlapping spectra; E) Discovery of rare bright objects especially for detailed JWST followup. PASSAGE data are public immediately, and our team plans to deliver fully-processed high-level data products.In this PASSAGE overview, we describe the survey and data quality, and present examples of these accomplishments in several areas of current interest in the evolution of emission-line galaxy properties, particularly at low masses.",
New submissions,Bubble in bubbles,"Dongdong Wei,Zong-Kuan Guo,Qiqi Fan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate the evolution and formation of double-layered vacuum bubbles during cosmological phase transitions with mltiple vacua. Using a semiclassical approach with initial velocity fluctuations, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, quantum effects do not lead to the formation of double-layered vacuum bubbles, while flyover transitions allow for their stable formation by overcoming successive potential barriers. The evolution of these bubbles, including wall acceleration, collisions, and the formation of trapped regions, is explored through numerical simulations. Our results show that the dynamics of double-layered bubbles differ significantly from standard single-wall bubbles, with implications for cosmological observables such as gravitational wave production and baryogenesis. These findings indicate that flyover transitions represent a complementary decay mechanism to the conventional quantum tunneling process.",
New submissions,Emulating Global 21 cm Cosmology Observations from the Lunar Far Side to Achieve Quick and Reliable Physical Constraints,"J. Dorigo Jones,J. O. Burns,D. Rapetti,Shah Mohammad Bahauddin,B. Reyes,D. W. Barker",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Efforts are underway to measure the global 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen, which is a powerful probe of the early universe, using NASA radio telescopes on the far side of the Moon. Physics-based models of the signal are computationally expensive to perform Bayesian multi-parameter inferences, for which we have developed novel, publicly-available neural network emulators utilizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ is currently the most accurate emulator in the community by leveraging the signal's temporally-correlated structure, and $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ maintains similar accuracy while training 75 times faster, by learning expressive functional transformations. Each emulator can fit realistic mock signals and obtain unbiased physical parameter constraints, with $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ able to complete end-to-end training and inference in under 30 minutes. The implementation of machine learning tools like these in data analysis pipelines is important to fully exploit upcoming measurements of the cosmological 21 cm signal.",
New submissions,An SIDM simulation of the merging cluster El Gordo and its tension between the post collision DM density profiles and weak lensing constraints,R. Valdarnini,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We review recent findings from a detailed simulation study of the merging cluster El Gordo and present new results inferred from weak lensing data. We found that the observed spatial offsets between the different mass components are well reproduced in merging simulations that include self-interacting dark matter (DM), with an elastic cross-section per unit mass of approximately \sigma_DM/m_X ~ 4 -5 cm^2/gr. Moreover, a relative line-of-sight peculiar velocity on the order of several hundred km/s is found between the two stellar components of the colliding subclusters. These findings strongly suggest the possibility that, in a very energetic cluster collision, DM could possess collisional properties. However, the self-interacting DM merger model presented here is not without difficulties. The values found for \sigma_DM/m_X being in conflict with the current upper bounds on cluster scales. As a solution to this tension we argue that in major cluster mergers the physical modeling of DM interactions, based on the scattering of DM particles, should be considered too simplistic. Additionally, the DM halos of the post-collision clusters have cored density profiles with core radii r_c ~ 300 kpc. Consequently, the associated reduced tangential shear lensing profiles consistently tend to zero at angles \theta <~ 40^{''}. This result is inconsistent with what is deduced from the measured profiles. These profiles exhibit a diverging behavior when \theta --> 0, as predicted by an NFW mass model. We argue that such contradictions cannot be easily reconciled within the DM models presented so far as an alternative to the collisionless paradigm. However, we suggest that this tension can be used as a unique test bed to probe new DM physics.",
New submissions,Les Houches on Dark Universe 2025: Elements of cosmology beyond FLRW,Pierre Fleury,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Modern cosmology is based on the cosmological principle, which states that the Universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic. When applied in its strict -- rather than statistical -- sense, the cosmological principle leads to the Friedmann--Lemaître--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) model, which serves as background spacetime. This background is used to predict: (1) the dynamics of cosmic expansion; and (2) the kinematics of light propagation through the Universe, which dictates the interpretation of cosmological observations. In this lecture, we shall discuss the performance of the FLRW model for those purposes, and present some results on the so-called backreaction and fitting problems.",
New submissions,An Accurate Comprehensive Approach to Substructure: IV. Dynamical Friction,"Eduard Salvador-Solé,Alberto Manrique,Andreu Rocamora",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"In three previous Papers we analysed the origin of the properties of halo substructure found in simulations. This was achieved by deriving them analytically in the peak model of structure formation, using the statistics of nested peaks (with no free parameter) plus a realistic model of subhalo stripping and shock-heating (with only one parameter). However, to simplify the treatment we neglected dynamical friction (DF). Here, we revisit that work by including it. That is done in a fully analytic manner, i.e. avoiding the integration of subhalo orbital motions. This leads to simple accurate expressions for the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloes of different masses, which disentangle the effects of DF from those of tidal stripping and shock-heating. This way we reproduce and explain the results of simulations and extend them to haloes of any mass, redshift and formation times in the desired cosmology.",
New submissions,The Perfect Host: JWST Cepheid Observations in a Background-Free SN Ia Host Confirm No Bias in Hubble-Constant Measurements,"Adam G. Riess,Siyang Li,Gagandeep S. Anand,Wenlong Yuan,Louise Breuval,Stefano Casertano,Lucas M. Macri,Dan Scolnic,Yukei S. Murakami,Alexei V. Filippenko,Thomas G. Brink",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cycle 1 JWST observations of Cepheids in SN Ia hosts resolved their red-giant-dominated NIR backgrounds, sharply reducing crowding and showing that photometric bias in lower-resolution HST data does not account for the Hubble tension. We present Cycle 2 JWST observations of >100 Cepheids in NGC 3447, a unique system that pushes this test to the limit by transitioning from low to no background contamination. NGC 3447, an SN Ia host at D~25 Mpc, is an interacting pair comprising (i) a spiral with mixed stellar populations, typical of H0 calibrators, and (ii) a young, star-forming companion (NGC 3447A) devoid of old stars and hence stellar crowdinga rare ""perfect host"" for testing photometric bias. We detect ~60 long-period Cepheids in each, enabling a ""three-way comparison"" across HST, JWST, and background-free conditions. We find no component-to-component offset (sigma<0.03 mag; a calibration independent test), and a 50% reduction in scatter to ~0.12 mag in the background-free case, the tightest seen for any SN Ia host. Across Cycles 1-2 we also measure Cepheids in all SH0ES hosts observed by JWST (19 hosts of 24 SNe Ia; >50% of the sample) and find no evidence of bias relative to HST photometry, including for the most crowded, distant hosts. These observations constitute the most rigorous test yet of Cepheid distances and provide strong evidence for their reliability. Combining JWST Cepheid measurements in 19 hosts (24 SNe Ia) with HST data (37 hosts, 42 SNe Ia) yields H0 = 73.49 +/- 0.93 km/s/Mpc. Including 35 TRGB-based calibrations (from HST and JWST) totals 55 SNe Ia and gives H0 = 73.18 +/- 0.88 km/s/Mpc, ~6 sigma above the LambdaCDM+CMB expectation.",
New submissions,Recovering the Dust Mass Budget with PRIMA,"A. Traina,F. Pozzi,F. Calura,M. Costa,L. Bisigello,C. Gruppioni,L. Barchiesi,I. Delvecchio,L. Vallini,C. Vignali,V. Casasola",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Achieving a complete picture of galaxy evolution is a primary goal of extragalactic astrophysics. To accomplish this ambitious task, a wealth of multi-wavelength surveys have been devoted to assess the cosmic evolution of the cold gas and of the stellar mass across cosmic time. In this cosmic census, one elusive component is represented by interstellar dust. In this work, we exploit the IR mission PRIMA (covering wavelengths from 24 $\mu$m to 235 $\mu$m) to perform a deep survey (1000h on 1 deg$^2$) aimed at estimating the still poorly known dust mass function (DMF) at $z \sim 0.5 - 5$. We consider the spectro-photometric realization of the SPRITZ simulation and we compute the dust masses using single temperature Modified Grey Body functions. We show how PRIMA alone, thanks to its unprecedented sensitivities, will constrain the DMF at $z < 1.5$, in terms of mass and faint-end slope. At $z > 1.5$, we stress the key synergy with current or future sub-millimeter facilities, such as the JCMT/SCUBA-2, AtLAST, LMT and ALMA telescopes, that will allow us to probe the R$-$J regime of PRIMA selected galaxies. Finally, PRIMA, thanks to its large photometric coverage, will be able for the first time to constrain strictly the warm dust properties of a two component dust model.",
New submissions,Probing the Dark Sector using the Fornax Satellite,"Eyal Zamlung,Adi Nusser",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A long-range force acting only in the dark sector can displace the stellar component of satellite galaxies relative to their dark matter (DM) halos, thereby \emph{breaking} the weak equivalence principle (WEP) between DM and baryons. We investigate observational signatures of such WEP breaking using $N$-body simulations of a Fornax-like Milky Way (MW) satellite, implementing a fifth force between DM particles of amplitude $\beta$ relative to Newtonian gravity (with a screening length much larger than the MW halo size). We find that $\beta \gtrsim 0.6$ strips and unbinds the bulk of the stellar component, leaving at most a negligible bound remnant that fails to match the observed stellar content, surface-brightness, and line-of-sight velocity-dispersion profiles of Fornax. By contrast, $\beta \lesssim 0.2$ yields only mild stellar stripping and remains broadly consistent with current photometric and kinematic constraints within our modeling assumptions.",
New submissions,One latent to fit them all: a unified representation of baryonic feedback on matter distribution,"Shurui Lin,Yin Li,Shy Genel,Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro,Biwei Dai,Wentao Luo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Accurate and parsimonious quantification of baryonic feedback on matter distribution is of crucial importance for understanding both cosmology and galaxy formation from observational data. This is, however, challenging given the large discrepancy among different models of galaxy formation simulations, and their distinct subgrid physics parameterizations. Using 5,072 simulations from 4 different models covering broad ranges in their parameter spaces, we find a unified 2D latent representation. Compared to the simulations and other phenomenological models, our representation is independent of both time and cosmology, much lower-dimensional, and disentangled in its impacts on the matter power spectra. The common latent space facilitates the comparison of parameter spaces of different models and is readily interpretable by correlation with each. The two latent dimensions provide a complementary representation of baryonic effects, linking black hole and supernova feedback to distinct and interpretable impacts on the matter power spectrum. Our approach enables developing robust and economical analytic models for optimal gain of physical information from data, and is generalizable to other fields with significant modeling uncertainty.",
New submissions,Alignment of spiral and elliptical galaxies from Siena Galaxy Atlas with filaments,"Yuvraj Muralichandran,Noam I. Libeskind,Elmo Tempel",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The properties of galaxies are known to have been influenced by the large-scale structures that they inhabit. Theory suggests that galaxies acquire angular momentum during the linear stage of structure formation, and hence predict alignments between the spin of halos and the nearby structures of the cosmic web. In this study, we use the largest catalog of galaxies publicly available - the Siena Galaxy Atlas - to study the alignment of the spin normals of elliptical and spiral galaxies with filaments constructed by applying the Bisous process on galaxies ($z \le$ 0.2) from SDSS - DR12. Our sample comprises 32517 disk and 18955 elliptical galaxies that are within 2 Mpc of any filament spine. We find that the spin normals of elliptical galaxies exhibit a strong perpendicular alignment with respect to the orientation of the host filaments, inconsistent with random distributions by up to $\approx$ 13 $\sigma$. The spin axis of spiral galaxies shows a much weaker but nonzero alignment signal with their host filaments of $ \approx$ 2.8$\sigma$ when compared with random. These numbers depend on exactly how the significance is measured, as elucidated in the text. Furthermore, the significance of the alignment signal is examined as a function of distance from the filament spine. Spiral galaxies reach a maximum signal between 0.5 and 1 Mpc. elliptical galaxies reach their maximum significance between 0.2 and 0.5 Mpc. We also note that with a tailored selection of galaxies, as a function of both i) distance from the filaments \& as a ii) function of absolute luminosity, the alignment significance can be maximized.",

Yamamoto",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present cosmological constraints from the Planck PSZ2 cosmological cluster sample, using weak-lensing shear profiles from Dark Energy Survey (DES) data and X-ray observations from the Chandra telescope for the mass calibration. We compute hydrostatic mass estimates for all clusters in the PSZ2 sample with a scaling relation between their Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal and X-ray derived hydrostatic mass, calibrated with the Chandra data. We introduce a method to correct these masses with a hydrostatic mass bias using shear profiles from wide-field galaxy surveys. We simultaneously fit the number counts of the PSZ2 sample and the mass calibration with the DES data, finding $\Omega_\text{m}=0.312^{+0.018}_{-0.024}$, $\sigma_8=0.777\pm 0.024$, $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_\text{m} / 0.3}=0.791^{+0.023}_{-0.021}$, and $(1-b)=0.844^{+0.055}_{-0.062}$ for our baseline analysis when combined with BAO data.

We verify the robustness of our results by exploring a variety of analysis settings, with a particular focus on the definition of the halo centre used for the extraction of shear profiles. We compare our results with a number of other analyses, in particular two recent analyses of cluster samples obtained from SPT and eROSITA data that share the same mass calibration data set. We find that our results are in overall agreement with most late-time probes, in very mild tension with CMB results (1.6$\sigma$), and in significant tension with results from eROSITA clusters (2.9$\sigma$). We confirm that our mass calibration is consistent with the eROSITA analysis by comparing masses for clusters present in both Planck and eROSITA samples, eliminating it as a potential cause of tension.",
New submissions,Enhancing the detectability of ionized Regions during the Epoch of Reionization,"Rutvik Ashish Mahajan,Raghunath Ghara,Nishant Pradeep Deo,Arnab Mishra",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present an improved matched filter method for detecting large ionized regions in 21 cm observations of the Epoch of Reionization. In addition to detection, the method constrains the properties of these regions, offering insights into the underlying source populations. Extending a previously developed Bayesian framework, we replace the spherical filter with an eight-parameter spheroidal filter, enabling a more flexible characterization of ionized bubbles. This enhancement significantly improves both detectability and recovery of bubble orientations. For a representative reionization scenario with mean ionization fraction $0.4$ at $z=7$, we find that a $10\sigma$ detection of the largest ionized region can be achieved with $\sim 1$, $2$, and $30$ h of observations using the SKA-low AA4, AA$^{\star}$, and AA2 configurations, respectively. Our method can help identify regions in the observed field that host large ionized bubbles, making them prime targets for deeper follow-up observations.",

New submissions,Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters,"Aubrey Jones,Benjamin C. Bromley",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hill's mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a model to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then use this model to estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 30 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of recent growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.",
New submissions,Disentangling Target Lines from Interlopers and Continuum with Neural Networks: A SPHEREx Intensity Mapping Case Study,"Marina S. Cagliari,Zucheng Gao,Azadeh Moradinezhad Dizgah",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Line-intensity mapping (LIM) traces the large-scale distribution of matter by measuring fluctuations in aggregate line emission from unresolved galaxies and the intergalactic medium, providing a powerful probe of both astrophysics and cosmology. However, interpreting LIM data is limited by our ability to disentangle the signal of a target spectral line from continuum emission and interloper lines, which are emissions from other redshifts that fall within the observed frequency band. Astrophysical modeling uncertainties further complicate matters, leaving the relative amplitudes of the map components poorly understood. In this paper, we present a neural-network (NN) approach to separate the three map components at the level of the angular power spectrum, explicitly accounting for uncertainties in their relative amplitudes. As test cases, we generate SPHEREx-like maps with variable interloper line luminosities across multiple frequency channels, with and without pixel-wise scatter and continuum contributions. We find that cross-channel correlations are essential for robust NN performance when scatter is present. The NN exhibits a hierarchy in residual errors: brighter components yield smaller residuals, and the dimmest the highest. Without continuum emission, the network recovers the target power spectrum to within $2.5\%$, while partially correcting the interloper spectra. With continuum included, the NN accurately reconstructs the power spectra of the continuum and target line, within $2\%$ and $6\%$, respectively, but fails to recover those of the interlopers. Reducing pixel-level scatter further improves performance, lowering residual errors to $1\%$ (continuum) and $3\%$ (target line).",
New submissions,Can an Anti-de Sitter Vacuum in the Dark Energy Sector Explain JWST High-Redshift Galaxy and Reionization Observations?,"Anirban Chakraborty,Tirthankar Roy Choudhury,Anjan Ananda Sen,Purba Mukherjee",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) discovery of an unexpectedly high abundance of UV-bright galaxies at redshifts $z > 10$ poses a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This work tests whether this tension can be resolved solely by modifying the cosmological background, without invoking significant evolution in the astrophysical properties of early galaxies. We investigate an alternative framework featuring the presence of an anti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, a model that naturally arises in quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure formation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy evolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of observations. We first show that while a model tailored to fit the high-$z$ UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) shows promise, it is in strong tension with well-established cosmological constraints from the CMB and other low-redshift probes. Conversely, models within this framework that are consistent with these constraints provide only a modest boost to structure formation and fail to reproduce the observed JWST galaxy abundances at $z > 10$. While these models remain consistent with the cosmic reionization history, our primary result is that this class of cosmological modifications is insufficient on its own to explain the galaxy excess. Our study underscores the critical importance of holistic testing for any beyond-$\Lambda$CDM proposal; apparent success in one observational regime does not guarantee overall viability. By demonstrating the limitations of a purely cosmological solution, our results strengthen the case that evolving astrophysical properties are a necessary ingredient for solving the challenge of early galaxy formation.",
New submissions,Kinetic field theory of compact systems,"Matthias Bartelmann,James Stokes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The kinetic field theory is developed without assumptions of statistical homogeneity and isotropy. In a solvable toy model with short-ranged interactions, we compare first-order perturbation theory to an iterated mean-field approximation scheme, demonstrating that the mean-field theory maintains positivity and captures collapse dynamics, allowing analytic estimates of blow-up times. In a self-gravitating sheet model, the first-order perturbation theory is shown to reproduce critical phenomena. This work suggests a path toward convergence analysis of the mean-field approximation and applications to more complex inhomogeneous systems.",
Cross submissions,One-loop corrections to infrared GWs is forbidden by symmetries,"Cheng-Jun Fang,Han-Wen Hu,Zong-Kuan Guo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Small-scale scalar perturbations amplified during inflation can induce primordial gravitational waves through tensor-scalar interactions. A long-standing controversial issue is whether the one-loop corrections to tensor perturbations exist on large scales. Firstly, we demonstrate through direct one-loop calculations that one-loop corrections cancel each other out on large scales. We then proceed from the symmetry of the interacting system and directly prove, based on the Ward identity, the absence of one-loop corrections on large scales-without the need for specific loop diagram calculations. This is consistent with the results we previously obtained for scalar perturbations.",
Cross submissions,Dark Energy and the Symbiosis Between Micro-physics and Cosmology (Naturally),C.P. Burgess,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"These lectures aim to highlight the remarkable symbiosis that currently exists between the physics of the very small and the physics of the very large, using the unsolved puzzle of the nature of Dark Energy as a vehicle for so doing. The lectures first summarize what we know observationally about the properties of Dark Energy (and the Dark sector more broadly) and then discuss several approaches to explain them. Along the way this involves determining the types of interactions that would on general grounds be expected to be present in the low-energy limit of fundamental theories involving the many hierarchy of scales we see around us. This includes (but is not limited to) a discussion of technical naturalness (and `t Hooft naturalness) as well as the arguments for their use as a criterion for distinguishing amongst candidate theories. Some recent approaches I find promising are briefly summarized at the end.",
Cross submissions,Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on the cosmological evolution in a Universe with a Weylian Boundary,"Teodora M. Matei,Cristian Croitoru,Tiberiu Harko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the effects that arise from the inclusion of Weylian boundary terms in the Einstein gravitational field equations in the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) framework. With the help of the generalized Friedmann equations for a Universe with a Weylian boundary, obtained for a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker FLRW metric, three distinct cosmological models can be constructed. The cosmological evolution is determined by a dissipative scalar field, and by the Weyl vector coming from the boundary. Several cosmological scenarios are obtained via the appropriate splitting of the generalized energy conservation equation. In the present work we obtain relevant constraints on these models by using the BBN data. In particular, the effects on the BBN that arise in the post warm-inflationary era will be examined by theoretically evaluating the measured abundances of relic nuclei (Hydrogen, Deuterium, Helium-3, Helium-4, and Lithium-7). We consider firstly the primordial mass fraction estimates, and their deviations due to changes in the freezing temperature, which impose an upper limit on the effective energy density obtained from the modified Friedmann equations. The deviation from the standard energy density of the radiative plasma is therefore constrained by the abundances of the Helium-4 nuclei. Secondly, an upper limit will be considered in a numerical analysis performed through the usage of the \texttt{PRyMordial} software package, with the help of which we calculate the primordial abundances of the light elements by evaluating the thermonuclear rates within the considered modified gravity framework. Finally, an MCMC analysis will validate the cosmological model with Weylian boundary contributions, imposing relevant constraints on the initial conditions of the cosmos. The methodology is implemented in the python code \texttt{genesys}, which is available on GitHub.",
Cross submissions,Inflationary dynamics of non-minimally coupled $f(R)$ matter-curvature theories,"Miguel Barroso Varela,Orfeu Bertolami,Andreas Mantziris",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This study examines how inflationary dynamics are affected by $f(R)$ theories with a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Both positive and negative corrections to the minimal coupling of General Relativity are considered, and a robust numerical method is developed that evolves the metric and the inflaton field in this modified theory beyond slow-roll. Through a stability analysis, we find that positive models are inherently unstable during slow-roll, whereas negative ones can accommodate a stable attractor de Sitter solution. Using the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum from the latest data releases, we constrain the scale of the non-minimal coupling to be above $10^{13}$ GeV. In light of the 2018 Planck, BICEP/Keck and the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope data for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, strong constraints on the coupling strength force the effects of these modified theories to be, at most, slightly above the perturbative level. Furthermore, we determine that the choice of the perfect fluid matter Lagrangian does not impact the inflationary observables at the pivot scale. Finally, we present the predicted observables for different inflationary potentials and show that even though classical gravity is still preferred by the data, there are areas of the parameter space that are viable for non-minimally coupled inflationary models.",
Cross submissions,"Quark, lepton and right-handed neutrino production via inflation","Duarte Feiteira,Fotis Koutroulis,Oleg Lebedev,Stefan Pokorski",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inflationary expansion of space-time provides us with an efficient particle production mechanism in the Early Universe. The fermion production efficiency depends critically on the particle mass, which is generated via the Yukawa coupling and sensitive to the corresponding scalar field value. During inflation, scalar fields experience large quantum fluctuations driving the average field values to the Hubble scale and above. This applies, in particular, to the Higgs field, making the Standard Model fermions very heavy and facilitating their production. Using the Bogolyubov coefficient approach, we compute the corresponding fermion abundance taking into account time dependence of the mass term. We find that the Standard Model fermion and the right-handed neutrino production grows dramatically compared to the naive estimate based on the low energy masses. The inflationary production mechanism can be the leading source of the right handed neutrinos, if they gain a Majorana mass from the Yukawa coupling to a light scalar. We also find a lower bound on the mass of fermionic dark matter, which can be produced by inflation.",

Cross submissions,Gravitational waves induced by matter isocurvature in general cosmologies,"Guillem Domènech,Jan Tränkle",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The expansion history and content of the Universe between the end of inflation and the onset of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is mostly unknown. In this paper, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by matter isocurvature fluctuations in a generic perfect fluid background as a novel probe of the physics of the very early Universe. We analytically compute the induced GW kernel and analyze the spectral GW energy density for a sharply peaked isocurvature power spectrum. We show that the spectral shape of the GW signal is sensitive to the equation of state parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid dominating the early Universe after inflation. We find that the GW amplitude is enhanced for a soft equation of state. Our framework can be applied to dark matter isocurvature and models leading to early matter-dominated eras, such as primordial black holes and cosmological solitons.",
