New submissions,Segmenting proto-halos with vision transformers,"Toka Alokda,Cristiano Porciani",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The formation of dark-matter halos from small cosmological perturbations generated in the early universe is a highly non-linear process typically modeled through N-body simulations. In this work, we explore the use of deep learning to segment and classify proto-halo regions in the initial density field according to their final halo mass at redshift $z=0$. We compare two architectures: a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the V-Net design and a U-Net transformer. We find that the transformer-based network significantly outperforms the CNN across all metrics, achieving sub-percent error in the total segmented mass per halo class. Both networks deliver much higher accuracy than the perturbation-theory-based model \textsc{pinocchio}, especially at low halo masses and in the detailed reconstruction of proto-halo boundaries. We also investigate the impact of different input features by training models on the density field, the tidal shear, and their combination. Finally, we use Grad-CAM to generate class-activation heatmaps for the CNN, providing preliminary yet suggestive insights into how the network exploits the input fields.",
New submissions,Effective Theories of Redshift-Space Galaxy Peculiar Velocities,"Shi-Fan Chen,Cullan Howlett,Yan Lai,Fei Qin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present predictions for redshift-space peculiar velocity statistics in the Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations of the effective field theory (EFT) of large-scale structure. We compute 2-point pairwise velocity statistics up to the second moment at next-to-leading (1-loop) order, showing that they can be modeled together with redshift-space galaxy densities with a consistent set of EFT coefficients. We show that peculiar velocity statistics have a distinct dependence on long-wavelength bulk flows that necessitates a variation on the usual infrared (IR) resummation procedure used to model baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy clustering. This can be implemented recursively in powers of the velocity in both the Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks. We validate our analytic calculations against fully nonlinear N-body simulations, demonstrating that they can be used to recover the growth rate at better than percent level precision, well beyond the statistical requirements of upcoming peculiar velocity surveys and measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect. As part of this work, we release $\texttt{velocisaurus}$, a fast $\texttt{Python}$ code for computing EFT predictions of peculiar velocity statistics.",
New submissions,The Simons Observatory: Assessing the Impact of Dust Complexity on the Recovery of Primordial $B$-modes,"Yiqi Liu,Susanna Azzoni,Susan E. Clark,Brandon S. Hensley,Léo Vacher,David Alonso,Carlo Baccigalupi,Michael L. Brown,Alessandro Carones,Jens Chluba,Jo Dunkley,Carlos Hervías-Caimapo,Bradley R. Johnson,Nicoletta Krachmalnicoff,Giuseppe Puglisi,Mathieu Remazeilles,Kevin Wolz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate how dust foreground complexity can affect measurements of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, in the context of the Simons Observatory, using a cross-spectrum component separation analysis. Employing a suite of simulations with realistic Galactic dust emission, we find that spatial variation in the dust frequency spectrum, parametrized by $\beta_d$, can bias the estimate for $r$ when modeled using a low-order moment expansion to capture this spatial variation. While this approach performs well across a broad range of dust complexity, the bias increases with more extreme spatial variation in dust frequency spectrum, reaching as high as $r\sim0.03$ for simulations with no primordial tensors and a spatial dispersion of $\sigma(\beta_d)\simeq0.3$ -- the most extreme case considered, yet still consistent with current observational constraints. This bias is driven by changes in the $\ell$-dependence of the dust power spectrum as a function of frequency that can mimic a primordial $B$-mode tensor signal. Although low-order moment expansions fail to capture the full effect when the spatial variations of $\beta_d$ become large and highly non-Gaussian, our results show that extended parametric methods can still recover unbiased estimates of $r$ under a wide range of dust complexities. We further find that the bias in $r$, at the highest degrees of dust complexity, is largely insensitive to the spatial structure of the dust amplitude and is instead dominated by spatial correlations between $\beta_d$ and dust amplitude, particularly at higher orders. If $\beta_d$ does spatially vary at the highest levels investigated here, we would expect to use more flexible foreground models to achieve an unbiased constraint on $r$ for the noise levels anticipated from the Simons Observatory.",
New submissions,An investigation of a varying G through Strong Lensing and SNe Ia observations,"R. F. L. Holanda,M. Ferreira,Javier E. Gonzalez",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this paper, we analyze the potential variation of the gravitational constant $G$ using data from strong gravitational lensing systems and Type Ia supernovae. Testing $G(z)$ parameterizations where $G(z) = G_0(1 + G_1z)$ and $G(z) = G_0(1 + z)^{G_1}$, we also account for the influence of $G$ on the luminosity of SNe Ia through the Chandrasekhar mass-luminosity relation. Only the flat universe hypothesis is considered. Constraints from 158 lensing systems and the Pantheon+ sample show no significant evidence of $G$ variation. However, although the results are compatible with no variation, the errors are not yet sufficiently restrictive to rule out any variation of $G$ with high statistical confidence. This study highlights the viability of using combined astrophysical data to probe variations in fundamental constants, suggesting that future surveys could refine these constraints.",
New submissions,Cosmic Trajectories calculation with state of the art lattice QCD equation of state,"Lorenzo Formaggio,Francesco Di Clemente,Geetika Yadav,Alessandro Drago,Claudia Ratti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We compute the full cosmic trajectories of the early Universe across the QCD phase diagram as the plasma cools from $T\simeq500\,$MeV to $30\,$MeV, assuming $\beta$-equilibrated matter. The trajectories are obtained by simultaneously solving baryon-number, electric-charge, and lepton-asymmetry conservation, closed by a state-of-the-art lattice-QCD equation of state: a fourth-order Taylor expansion in the chemical potentials that merges the latest $(2\!+\!1)$-flavor susceptibilities with charm-quark contributions, thus delivering a consistent $(2\!+\!1\!+\!1)$-flavor equation of state. Results are compared with an ideal quark-gluon plasma and with a hadron-resonance gas to highlight interaction effects. Two cases of primordial lepton asymmetries are analyzed: a symmetric configuration $(\ell_e=\ell_\mu=\ell_\tau=\ell/3)$ and an asymmetric one $(\ell_e=0,\;\ell_\mu=-\ell_\tau)$. Increasing $|\ell|$ systematically drives the trajectories toward larger values of $\mu_B$ and more negative $\mu_Q$. In the asymmetric case, a non-monotonic bounce develops when the $\tau$ chemical potential reaches $m_\tau$, generating a maximum in $\mu_B(T)$, the position of which depends on $\ell_\tau$. Assuming a modest $\mu_{Q}$-dependence of the lattice-QCD critical end point estimates (obtained at $\mu_{Q} = 0$), the trajectories for all lepton asymmetries explored ($|\ell|\lesssim 0.1$) lie to their left, implying that in a standard cosmological scenario the QCD transition is almost certainly a smooth crossover. Nevertheless, we estimate the magnitude of baryon and lepton asymmetries needed to obtain a cosmic trajectory closer to the QCD critical point, providing inputs for future studies of the strong-interaction epoch.",
New submissions,Accretion disc reverberation mapping in a high-redshift quasar,"F. Pozo Nuñez,E. Bañados,S. Panda,J. Heidt",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Powered by supermassive black holes at their centers, quasars are among the most luminous objects in the Universe, serving as important probes of cosmic history and galaxy evolution. The size of the accretion disc surrounding the black hole is a critical parameter for understanding quasar physics and their potential use as standard candles in cosmology. However, direct measurements of accretion disc sizes have so far been confined to the Local Universe ($z<0.2$), limiting our understanding of quasars during the peak of cosmic activity. Here, we report the first direct measurement of the accretion disc size in the quasar QSO J0455-4216 at $z=2.66$, when the Universe was only $\sim2$ Gyrs old. Medium-band filters mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory were used to isolate continuum emission regions during a six-month monitoring campaign. The light curves exhibit pronounced variability features and enabled the detection of inter-band time delays from different parts of the disc. We mapped the disc and located its ultraviolet-emitting outermost region at $3.02^{+0.33}_{-0.57}$ light-days from the black hole ($\sim 500$ AU). Given a supermassive black hole 900 million times the mass of the Sun, these measurements validate accretion disc theory at an unprecedented redshift and pave the way for efficient black hole mass estimates, reducing decades-long spectroscopic reverberation campaigns to just a few years or less.",
New submissions,An Observed Evidence for the Primordial Origin of Galaxy Sizes,"Jun-Sung Moon(1,2),Jounghun Lee(1) ((1) Seoul Nat'l Univ., (2) ASIAA)",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present an observational evidence supporting the scenario that the protogalactic angular momenta play the most decisive role in molding the optical sizes of present galaxies. Analyzing the NASA-Sloan Atlas catalog in the redshift range of $0.02\le z<0.09$, we observationally determine the probability density distributions, $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$, where $r_{50}$ and $r_{90}$ denote the galaxy sizes enclosing $50\%$ and $90\%$ of their $r$-band luminosities, respectively. Both of the distributions are found to be well described by a bimodal Gamma mixture model, which is consistent with the recent numerical results. Classifying the local galaxies by their ratios, $r_{50}/r_{90}$, we also show that for the case of late-type galaxies with $r_{50}/r_{90}\ge 0.45$ both of $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ exhibit no bimodal feature, following a unimodal Gamma model. Assuming the existence of a linear causal correlation between $\{r_{50},r_{90}\}$ of the late-type galaxies and the primordial spin factor, $\tau$, defined as the degree of misalignments between the initial tidal and protogalaxy inertia tensors, we reconstruct the probability density distributions, $p(\tau)$, directly from the observationally determined $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ of the late-type galaxies, and show excellent agreements with the real distributions of $\tau$ which were determined at the protogalactic stages by numerical experiments. A critical implication of our result on reconstructing the initial conditions from observable galaxy sizes is discussed.",
New submissions,A sample of giant radio sources from the NVGRC catalog,"Olga Zhelenkova,Milena Khoruzhenko",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present the results of a search for megaparsec-scale sources in the NVGRC catalog of candidates of giant radio source (GRS) based on the NVSS sky survey. We visually inspected 370 NVGRC sources, as well as radio sources falling within a neighborhood of about one square degree around the target object. In the studied sample, 48% of objects were classified as giant radio sources, 14% as sources with a projected linear size of less than 0.72 Mpc, and 38\% as physically unrelated objects combined by the recognition algorithm into one radio source. We identified 197 gaints, of which 72 radio sources are known GRGs or GRQs, and 125 sources were identified by us as GRS for the first time. Comparing the proportion of FRI giants in four redshift bins, we found that for z<0.05, the proportions of FRI and FRII sources were approximately equal, but already at z>0.15 the proportion of FRI giants decreases sharply. The predominance of FRII giants in the GRS lists is most likely due to observational selection due to the sensitivity limit of existing radio surveys. Comparing the NVSS and VLASS cutouts, we found that 33% of sources can be classified as fadded. 25% of the sources show a restart of the radio source phase. 38% of the sources have deformed radio lobes. Our GRS sample includes 74% of galaxies, 15% of IR-excess galaxies, which, according to the WISE photometric data, can be attributed to quasars, and 11% of quasars. When visually examining the optical survey cutouts, we noted the presence of close neighbors for the hosts and/or their belonging to known groups or clusters of galaxies. Close neighbors at a distance of less than 50 kpc were found for 39% of radio sources, and 28% of sources are part of groups or clusters of galaxies. Thus, about 70% of gaints are in a fairly dense environment, and this proportion may be higher.",
New submissions,Rapid cosmological inference with the two-loop matter power spectrum,"Thomas Bakx,Henrique Rubira,Nora Elisa Chisari,Zvonimir Vlah",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We compute the two-loop effective field theory (EFT) power spectrum of dark matter density fluctuations in $\Lambda$CDM using the recently proposed COBRA method (Bakx. et al, 2025). With COBRA, we are able to evaluate the two-loop matter power spectrum in $\sim 1$ millisecond at $ \sim 0.1 \%$ precision on one CPU for arbitrary redshifts and on scales where perturbation theory applies. As an application, we use the nonlinear matter power spectrum from the Dark Sky simulation to assess the performance of the two-loop EFT power spectrum compared to the one-loop EFT power spectrum at $z=0$. We find that, for volumes typical for Stage IV galaxy surveys, $V = 25 \,(\text{Gpc}/h)^3$, the two-loop EFT can provide unbiased cosmological constraints on $\Omega_m,H_0$ and $A_s$ using scales up to $k_\text{max}=0.26\, h/\text{Mpc}$, thereby outperforming the constraints from the one-loop EFT ($k_\text{max}=0.11\, h/\text{Mpc}$). The Figure of Merit on these three parameters increases by a factor $\sim 1.9$ and the one-dimensional marginalized constraints improve by $\sim35\%$ for $\Omega_m$, $\sim20\%$ for $H_0$ and $\sim 15\%$ for $A_s$.",
New submissions,Effective Phantom Divide Crossing with Standard and Negative Quintessence,"Adrià Gómez-Valent,Alex González-Fuentes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmic microwave background data from the Planck satellite, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this Letter, we show that this peak does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to 0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in front of standard quintessence around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at a $3.27\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant role in cosmic dynamics.",
New submissions,Dependence of halo properties on central-satellite magnitude gaps through weak lensing measurements,"Mingtao Yang,Jiaxin Han,Wenting Wang,Hekun Li,Cong Liu,Jun Zhang,Shuai Feng,Shiyin Shen,Zhenjie Liu,Xiaohu Yang,Yi Lu,Surhud More",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The magnitude gap between the central and satellite galaxies encodes information about the mass accretion history of a dark matter halo, and serves as a useful observational probe for the mass distribution in a halo. In this work, we perform the first weak lensing test of the connections between the magnitude gap and the halo profile. We measure the halo profiles of isolated central galaxies (ICGs) selected primarily from the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample. Halo mass and concentration are inferred by fitting stacked lensing profiles in bins of central luminosity, $L_\mathrm{c}$, and the central-satellite magnitude gap, $L_\mathrm{gap}$. We detect dependence on the magnitude gap in both halo properties. The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of $10^{10.3}<L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot]\leq 10^{10.7}$, where halos with smaller gaps have higher masses and lower concentrations. When $10^{10.7} <L_c[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{11.1}$, however, no significant gap dependence is detected. In the range of $10^{9.9}<L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{10.3}$, a disordering of the gap dependence is marginally observable. We compare the observational results with predictions by two lightcone catalogs built from the Illustris TNG300 and the Millennium simulations. The gap dependence in the two mock samples show overall consistency with observations, but neither matches them in all $L_\mathrm{c}$ bins to a quantitative level. We also compare the significance of the gap dependence on halo mass and concentration and find that our measurement prefers gap dependence in both parameters, while the halo mass dependence is preferred over the concentration if only one of the two dependencies is allowed.",
New submissions,Forward cascade of large-scale primordial magnetic fields during structure formation,"Molly Abramson,Emma Clarke,Tina Kahniashvili,Sayan Mandal,Salome Mtchedlidze,Jennifer Schober",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The origin of large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is widely thought to be from early Universe processes, like inflation or phase transitions. These magnetic fields evolve via magnetohydrodynamic processes until the epoch of recombination. When structures begin to form in the later Universe, the conservation of magnetic flux amplifies the magnetic fields via the adiabatic collapse of gravitationally bound gas clouds hosting the magnetic fields and moves them to smaller scales. In this work, we have semi-analytically studied this forward cascade effect, considering simple models of gravitational collapse of structures. We find that this simple model is able to reproduce the general qualitative features of the evolution of the magnetic field spectrum as seen from magnetized cosmological simulations.",
New submissions,The X-ray$-$UV Luminosity Relation of eROSITA Quasars,"Andrea Sacchi,Guido Risaliti,Matilde Signorini,Emanuele Nardini,Elisabeta Lusso,Bartolomeo Trefoloni",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity in quasars has been studied for decades. However, as we lack a comprehensive model able to explain it, its investigation still relies on observational efforts. This work focuses on optically selected quasars detected by eROSITA. We present the properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS) and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\approx3$ and $z\approx1.5$, respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.",
New submissions,Can cosmic rotation resolve the Hubble tension? Constraints from CMB and large-scale structure,"Micol Benetti,David A. Cook,Saulo Carneiro",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a relativistic cosmological model with background rotation, sourced by a non-perfect fluid with anisotropic stress. A modified version of the CLASS Boltzmann code is employed to perform MCMC analyses against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and late-time datasets. The results show that current CMB data constrain the present-day rotation parameter to be negligible. As a consequence, the derived cosmological parameters remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM values. In contrast, late-time probes such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) allow for a higher level of rotation and yield an increased Hubble constant. However, this comes at the cost of a higher $\sigma_8$, which remains in tension with DES-Y3 measurement. Combining CMB, SNe and BAO data confirms the preference for non-rotation.",
New submissions,A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes,"Saiyang Zhang,Boyuan Liu,Volker Bromm",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon--dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm b\chi} \gtrsim 0.8 \sigma_{\rm b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{\rm b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm infall} \gtrsim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at redshift $z\sim 10-20$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q\sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH--DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining high-$z$ sources such as Little Red Dots, and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin, bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.",
New submissions,Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism I: Pure axion inflation,"Richard von Eckardstein,Kai Schmitz,Oleksandr Sobol",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Axion inflation is a well-motivated model of cosmic inflation with a rich phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies of axion inflation that may confirm or improve the predictions of our GEF benchmark.",
Cross submissions,Dark wounds on icy moons: Ganymede's subsurface ocean as a dark matter detector,William DeRocco,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP),"Dark matter in the form of macroscopic composites is largely unconstrained at masses of $\sim 10^{11}- 10^{17}$ g. In this mass range, dark matter may collide with planetary bodies, depositing an immense amount of energy and leaving dramatic surface features that remain detectable on geological timescales. In this paper, we show that Ganymede, the largest Jovian moon, provides a prime target to search for dark matter impacts due to its differentiated composition and Gyr-old surface. We study the effects of dark matter collisions with Ganymede first with analytic estimates, finding that in a large region of parameter space, dark matter punches through Ganymede's conductive ice sheet, liberating sub-surface material. This sub-surface material may be compositionally different from the surface ice, providing a key observable with which to discriminate asteroid impacts from those caused by dark matter. We confirm our analytic estimates with dedicated simulations of dark matter impacts using iSALE, a multi-material impact code. We then discuss potential detection prospects with two missions currently en route to the Jovian system, Europa Clipper and JUICE, finding that these missions may have the ability not only to identify signs of life on the Galilean moons, but signs of dark matter as well.",
Cross submissions,On the gravitational waves from super massive RHNs produced at preheating,"Shinya Kanemura,Kunio Kaneta,Dibyendu Nanda",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The post-inflationary production of supermassive particles can have profound implications for the thermal history of the universe and may leave observable imprints in the gravitational wave (GW) background. In scenarios where the inflaton couples predominantly to heavy fields, say right-handed neutrino (RHN), non-perturbative mechanisms such as parametric resonance can lead to their efficient production, even when their masses exceed the inflaton mass. Once produced, the RHNs emit gravitons through bremsstrahlung as they decay into the Standard Model (SM) particles via $N\rightarrow \ell + H$, enabled by the unavoidable minimal coupling to gravity, sourcing a stochastic GW background. We study this mechanism within the framework of $\alpha-$attractor inflationary models, highlighting how the resulting GW spectrum carries indirect imprints of the heavy sector and the post-inflationary dynamics. This offers an observational window into otherwise inaccessible supermassive particles and provides a powerful probe of high-scale physics beyond the SM.",
Cross submissions,Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion,"Bo Liang,Chang Liu,Hanlin Song,Zhenwei Lyu,Minghui Du,Peng Xu,Ziren Luo,Sensen He,Haohao Gu,Tianyu Zhao,Manjia Liang Yuxiang Xu,Li-e Qiang,Mingming Sun,Wei-Liang Qian",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Space Physics (physics.space-ph),"The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like LISA and Taiji promises deep insights into strong-field gravity and black hole astrophysics. However, the complex, non-convex likelihood landscapes of EMRI signals (compounded by instrumental noises) have long hindered reliable parameter estimation based on traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which often fail to escape local optima or require impractical computational costs. To address this critical bottleneck, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a pioneering Bayesian framework that synergizes continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By leveraging CNFs to rapidly explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and PTMCMC for precise posterior sampling, FM-MCMC achieves unprecedented efficiency and accuracy in recovering EMRI intrinsic parameters. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference, FM-MCMC unlocks the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.",
