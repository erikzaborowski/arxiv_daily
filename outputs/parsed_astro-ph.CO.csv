New submissions,Cancellation of one-loop correction to soft tensor power spectrum,"Yohei Ema,Muzi Hong,Ryusuke Jinno,Kyohei Mukaida",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We demonstrate that there are no scale-invariant one-loop corrections to the superhorizon tensor perturbations from small-scale (potentially enhanced) scalar perturbations, irrespective of the details of inflationary background time evolution. For this purpose we derive a soft tensor effective field theory at leading order in the gradient expansion by integrating out small-scale scalar fluctuations in a general time-dependent background over the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, i.e., we perform loop calculations in the soft limit of external momentum. The absence of scale-invariant corrections originates from the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity and is therefore unavoidable.",
New submissions,The Impact of $Ω_{m0}$ Prior Bias on Cosmological Parameter Estimation: Reconciling DESI DR2 BAO and Pantheon+ SNe Data Combination Results,Seokcheon Lee,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent cosmological parameter analyses combining DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data with external probes, such as Pantheon+ Supernovae (SNe) observations, have reported deviations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameters ($\oo, \oa$) from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model predictions ($\oo=-1, \oa=0$). A notable aspect of these results is the role of $\Omo$ prior information from SNe, which is known to exhibit tension with BAO-only constraints. In this study, we rigorously investigate this effect through a statistical analysis using 100 mock DESI DR2 BAO data realizations. We demonstrate that the strong degeneracy between $\oo$, $\oa$, and $\Omo$ causes significant biases in the estimated dark energy parameters when the $\Omo$ prior mean deviates from its true underlying value. Specifically, applying an $\Omo$ prior mean of 0.33 (consistent with some SNe-only constraints) to mock data, assuming a true $\Lambda$CDM universe ($\Omo=0.30, \oo=-1, \oa=0$), yields biased estimates such as $\oo \approx -0.82 \pm 0.06$ and $\oa \approx -0.82 \pm 0.4$. This systematic shift, driven by the $\Omo$ prior, moves the estimated parameters towards the non-$\Lambda$CDM region, offering a qualitative resemblance to outcomes reported in current combined DESI DR2 BAO + Pantheon+ SNe analyses (e.g., $\oo = -0.888^{+0.055}_{-0.064}$, $\oa = -0.17 \pm 0.46$). Our findings suggest that these observed non-$\Lambda$CDM parameters may largely arise from statistical biases due to $\Omo$ prior tensions between datasets. This study proposes a potential resolution to current cosmological tensions without necessarily invoking new physics.",
New submissions,The Modeling Landscape of Extragalactic CO in CMB Surveys,"Yogesh Mehta,Anirban Roy,Simon Foreman,Alexander van Engelen,Nick Battaglia",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Extragalactic carbon monoxide (CO) line emission will likely be an important signal in current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys on small scales. However, great uncertainty surrounds our current understanding of CO emission. We investigate the implications of this modeling uncertainty on CMB surveys. Using a range of star formation rate and luminosity relations, we generate a suite of CO simulations across cosmic time, together with the broadband cosmic infrared background (CIB). From these, we quantify the power spectrum signatures of CO that we would observe in a CMB experiment at 90, 150, and 220 GHz. We find that the resulting range of CO auto-spectra spans up to two orders of magnitude and that while CO on its own is unlikely to be detectable in current CMB experiments, its cross-correlation with the CIB will be a significant CMB foreground in future surveys. We then forecast the bias on CMB foregrounds that would result if CO were neglected in a CMB power spectrum analysis, finding shifts that can be comparable to some of the uncertainties on CMB foreground constraints from recent surveys, particularly for the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and radio sources, and many times greater than the expected uncertainties expected for future data. Finally, we assess how the broad range of multifrequency CO$\times$CIB spectra we obtain is captured by a reduced parameter set by performing a principal component analysis, finding that three amplitude parameters suffice for a CMB-S4-like survey. Our results demonstrate the importance for future CMB experiments to account for a wide range of CO modeling, and that high-precision CMB experiments may help constrain extragalactic CO models.",
New submissions,Testing Light Unaffiliated Mass Clumps in MACS 0416 on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales using JWST,"Marceau Limousin,Derek Perera,Liliya L.R. Williams,Jori Liesenborgs,Gregor Rihtarsic",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Light unaffiliated mass clumps (LUMCs), i.e. dark matter (DM) components without any stellar counterparts, have been reported in strong lensing mass reconstructions of MACS 0416, both on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales. On galaxy cluster scale, the most recent parametric study based on 303 multiple images features a LUMC, in the south of the cluster. On galaxy scale, the most recent GRALE non-parametric study based on 237 multiple images features two LUMCs, M1 and M2. Given the implications of these findings in the context of structure formation and evolution, we test these features parametrically, using LENSTOOL. First, we show that a mass model where each large scale DM component introduced in the modelling is associated with a stellar counterpart can reproduce the 303 multiple images, removing the need for any cluster scale LUMC in \lens. We then update the GRALE model using the 303 multiple images, finding that one of the two galaxy scale LUMC, M1, is no longer significant, while M2 remains. We test M2 by explicitely including it in our parametric model. We find that the inclusion of this LUMC does not improve the global RMS, but mildly improves locally the RMS for one multiple image located close to M2. Besides, the preferred mass for M2 corresponds to the lowest mass allowed by the adopted prior. M2 is therefore not strongly favoured by a parametric approach but it is not ruled out. We present a comparison of parametric and non-parametric models in the M2 area. Both approaches show very similar surface mass density at this location, with a 5-6 % difference between the mass maps. The difference is that GRALE favors a distinct mass substructure when LENSTOOL favors a more diffuse mass distribution. We have been able to propose a parametric mass model without including any LUMCs, providing further evidences for DM being associated with light in clusters.",
New submissions,Comprehensively Constraining Ultra-Light Primordial Black Holes Through Relic Formation and Early Mergers,"Amirah Aljazaeri,Christian T. Byrnes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate constraints on the least explored, smallest mass scales of primordial black holes (PBHs), which evaporate prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Our study examines the impact of Planck-mass relics on the allowed fraction of dark matter composed of PBHs ($f_{PBH}$), as well as on the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background and the formation of primordial binaries. We discuss how these binaries and early mergers lead to longer PBH lifetimes, extending the reach of the stringent BBN constraints to smaller masses than usually expected. We make comprehensive constraint plots on the collapse fraction $\beta$ and $f_{PBH}$ (including relics), focusing on ultra-light PBHs.",
New submissions,"Tracing Dark Matter in the Central Regions of Galaxy Clusters Using Galaxies, Gas, and Intracluster Light in TNG300: Connections to Cluster Dynamical State","Jaewon Yoo,Jihye Shin,Ho Seong Hwang,Cristiano G. Sabiu,Hyowon Kim,Jongwan Ko,Jong Chul Lee",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent studies have highlighted the potential of intracluster light (ICL) as a dark matter tracer. Moreover, the ICL co-evolves with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the host cluster, making it a valuable tool for understanding cluster dynamics. In this study, we utilize 426 galaxy clusters (with total mass $M_{\rm tot}>10^{14} M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$) simulated in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Illustris TNG300 to compare the spatial distributions of dark matter, member galaxies, gas, and ICL and assess their effectiveness as dark matter tracers in the central regions of clusters at $R_{\rm vir}<0.3$. We apply the Weighted Overlap Coefficient (WOC), a methodology for quantifying the similarity of two-dimensional spatial distributions, to various components of the galaxy clusters at different dynamical stages. Our findings reveal that the spatial distributions of both ICL combined with the BCG and gas closely resemble the dark matter distribution, with higher fidelity observed in more relaxed galaxy clusters with earlier half-mass epochs. These results demonstrate that the BCG+ICL component serves as an effective tracer of dark matter, consistent with previous observational studies linking cluster light to mass. Moreover, the degree of spatial similarity between the BCG+ICL and dark matter distributions appears to reflect the dynamical state of the cluster.",
New submissions,Stabilizing simulation-based cosmological Fisher forecasts: a case study using the Voronoi volume function,"Saee Dhawalikar(1),Aseem Paranjape(1),Shadab Alam(2) ((1) IUCAA, (2) TIFR)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Forecasting cosmological constraints from halo-based statistics often suffers from instability in derivative estimates, especially when the number of simulations is limited. This instability reduces the reliability of Fisher forecasts and machine learning based approaches that use derivatives. We introduce a general framework that addresses this challenge by stabilizing the input statistic and then systematically identifying the optimal subset of summary statistics that maximizes cosmological information while simultaneously minimizing the instability of predicted constraints. We demonstrate this framework using the Voronoi volume function (VVF), a summary statistic that captures beyond two-point clustering information. Applying our two-step procedure -- random sub-sampling followed by optimization -- improves the constraining power by up to a factor of 2, while also enhancing the stability of the forecasts across realizations. As surveys like Euclid, DESI, and LSST push toward tighter constraints, the ability to produce stable and accurate theoretical predictions is essential. Our results suggest that new summary statistics such as the VVF, combined with careful data curation and stabilization strategies, can play a key role in next-generation precision cosmology.",
New submissions,Going beyond $S_8$: fast inference of the matter power spectrum from weak-lensing surveys,"Cyrille Doux,Tanvi Karwal",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Weak lensing surveys are often summarized by constraints on the derived parameter ${S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$, obscuring the rich scale and redshift information encoded in the data, and limiting our ability to identify the origin of any tensions with $\Lambda$CDM predictions from the cosmic microwave background. In this work, we introduce a fast and flexible framework to extract the scale-dependent matter power spectrum $P(k, z)$ from cosmic shear and CMB lensing measurements, parameterizing deviations from the Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction as a free function $\alpha(k)$. Using public data from DES Y3, KiDS-1000, HSC Y3, and ACT DR6, we constrain $\alpha(k)$ with fast Hamiltonian Monte Carlo inference. Our results show a consistent 15-30\% suppression in the matter power spectrum at intermediate scales ($k \sim 0.1-1{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) in galaxy-lensing data relative to Planck, with combined tensions reaching up to $4\sigma$ at fixed cosmology. In contrast, ACT CMB lensing is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at ${k\lesssim 0.1 {\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$. We validate our method using mock data, quantify consistency between datasets, and demonstrate how the resulting $\alpha(k)$ likelihoods can be used to test specific models for the power spectrum. All code, data products, and derived likelihoods are publicly released. Our results highlight the importance of reporting lensing constraints on $P(k, z)$ and pave the way for model-agnostic test of growth of structure with upcoming surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.",
New submissions,Primordial magnetic fields and modified recombination histories,"Jonathan Schiff,Tejaswi Venumadhav",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent cosmological data and astrophysical observations, such as the Hubble tension and the increasing preference from galaxy surveys for dynamical dark energy, have begun to challenge the standard $\Lambda$-cold dark matter cosmological model. Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) offer a mechanism to alleviate these tensions within the framework of the standard model. These fields source excess small-scale baryon clumping, which can speed up recombination and shrink the comoving sound horizon at the surface of last scattering. Computing the modified recombination history requires coupling the radiative transport of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons to compressible magnetohydronamic simulations. Since doing so is generically computationally intractable, we have developed a linearized treatment which self-consistently computes the modified recombination history in the presence of PMF induced baryon clumping for fields with red-tilted spectra. The clumping factors we find are too small to alleviate outstanding cosmological tensions, but our general framework can be applied to other PMF spectra, and provides a significant theoretical step towards a complete account of recombination in the presence of small-scale baryon clumping.",
New submissions,Black holes as telescopes: Discovering supermassive binaries through quasi-periodic lensed starlight,"Hanxi Wang,Miguel Zumalacárregui,Bence Kocsis",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary systems are unavoidable outcomes of galaxy mergers. Their dynamics encode information about their formation and growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed. Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final parsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral -- leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections. SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with comparable masses and $z<0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density. Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate outstanding questions around them.",
New submissions,Analysis of shape and angular orientation parameters of velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation signals in Galactic Centers for FIRE simulations,Daniel McKeown,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We use FIRE-2 zoom cosmological simulations of Milky Way size galaxy halos to characterize the shape of the J-factor emission signal on the sky. We find that, at a fixed dJ/d{\Omega} contour,the shape is well-fit by an ellipse, with semi-major axis Rmajor and semi-minor axis Rminor measured in degrees on the sky. We use least squares fitting to fit ellipses to the J-factor emission, viewed from the solar location. The ratio of minor to major axes (Rminor/Rmajor) allows us to characterize the shape of each contour, with ratio 1.0 corresponding to circular/spherical emission. These results provide new expectations for the shape of dark matter annihilation emission signals we might expect to see if dark matter is annihilating with its own anti-particle. We find that both the shape and angular orientation of the emission signal is different than results predict from dark matter only simulations. In terms of shape, we find that the ratios of semi-minor to semi-major axis is always consistently at 0.8, revealing a consistent circular emission shape, whereas with dark matter only emission signals the range of ratios from halo to halo is broader, and often closer to 0.5, showing a much more elliptical shape in general. In terms of angular orientation, we find that the major axis of the J-factor emission signal maps for FIRE halos are consistently aligned with the galactic plane within a few degrees, meaning that excess emission out of the plane would be hard to explain with a dark matter annihilation signal. However, we also find that the expected emission signal would be consistent with Fermi-LAT measurements showing a galactic center excess in full hydrodynamical simulations with stars and gas included, while dark-matter-only simulations do not produce the expected signal.",
New submissions,Analytical weak-lensing shear response of galaxy model fitting,Xiangchong Li,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxy model fitting is widely employed to estimate properties such as galaxy shape, size, and color. Understanding how the outputs of galaxy model fitting respond to weak-lensing shear distortions is crucial for accurate shear estimation and mitigating shear-related systematics in weak lensing image analyses. In this paper, we investigate how the fitted parameters - specifically flux, size, and shape - respond to weak-lensing shear distortions within the AnaCal framework. To achieve this, we introduce quintuple numbers, a novel algebraic system inspired by dual numbers from automatic differentiation. Quintuple numbers enable the propagation of shear response information throughout the entire model-fitting process by linking analytical pixel shear responses to those of the fitted parameters. We integrate quintuple numbers into the AnaCal framework to derive the shear responses of shapes estimated with model fitting and validate the pipeline using image simulations that include realistic blending. Our results demonstrate that the multiplicative bias remains below 0.003 for ground-based, oversampled images.",
New submissions,Observational Space Unveils Cosmic Expansion's Role in the Hubble Tension,"Kang Jiao,Tong-Jie Zhang,Liang Gao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We introduce a geometric embedding method that directly constrains $H_0$ by exploiting the exact kinematic relation $\dot{z} = H_0(1+z) - H(z)$ in a unified observational framework. This approach reconstructs expansion history without requiring specific cosmological models, incorporating both existing Cosmic Chronometer data and forecasted Sandage-Loeb measurements. Through mathematical embedding of observational constraints, we achieve $\sim 1.6\%$ precision in $H_0$ determination, matching current Cepheid distance ladder accuracy while maintaining model independence. The method demonstrates how fundamental kinematic constraints enable precision cosmology, providing a promising pathway to address the Hubble tension as future redshift drift observations become available.",
New submissions,CosmoGLINT: Cosmological Generative Model for Line Intensity Mapping with Transformer,"Kana Moriwaki,Rui Lan Jun,Ken Osato,Naoki Yoshida",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Modelling star-forming galaxies is crucial for upcoming observations of large-scale matter and galaxy distributions with galaxy redshift surveys and line intensity mapping (LIM). We introduce CosmoGLINT (Cosmological Generative model for Line INtensity mapping with Transformer), a Transformer-based generative framework designed to create realistic galaxy populations from dark matter (DM)-only simulations. CosmoGLINT auto-regressively generates sequences of galaxy properties -- including star formation rate (SFR), distance to the halo centre, and radial and tangential velocities relative to the halo -- conditioned on halo mass. Trained on the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation, the model reproduces key statistical properties of the original data, including the voxel intensity distribution and the power spectrum both in real and redshift space. It can efficiently generate a number of different realisations of the designated galaxy populations, enabling the creation of mock LIM/redshift survey catalogues from large halo catalogues produced by fast DM-only simulations. We show that our model trained at multiple redshifts can be applied to DM halo lightcone data to generate a realistic mock galaxy lightcone with incorporating the redshift evolution of the galaxy population. The mock catalogues can be readily used to derive statistical quantities and to develop data analysis pipelines for ongoing and future wide-field surveys.",
New submissions,Infalling Ultra Faint Dwarfs as Emissaries of the Axiverse?,"A. Pozo,T. Broadhurst,H. N. Luu,G. Smoot,K. Umetsu,T. Chiueh,H.-Y. Schive,R. Emami,L. Hernquist,P. Mocz,M. Vogelsberger",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Recent discoveries of Ultra Faint dwarf galaxies (UFG's) infalling onto the Milky Way, namely Leo K \& M at $r \simeq 450$kpc, considerably strengthens the case that UFG's constitute a distinct galaxy class that is inherently smaller, fainter and metal poor compared to the classical dwarf spheroidals (dSph). This distinction is at odds with the inherent continuity of galaxy halo masses formed under scale-free gravity for any standard dark matter model. Here we show that distinct galaxy classes do evolve in cosmological simulations of multiple light bosons representing the 'Axiverse' proposal of String Theory, where a discrete mass spectrum of axions is generically predicted to span many decades in mass. In this context, theobserved UFG class we show corresponds to a relatively heavy boson of $3\times 10^{-21}$eV, including Leo K \& M, whereas a lighter axion of $10^{-22}$eV comprises the bulk of dark matter in all larger galaxies including the dSph's. Although Leo M is larger in size than Leo K, we predict its velocity dispersion to be smaller $\simeq 1.7$km/s, compared to $\simeq 4.5$km/s for Leo K, since soliton cores are required by the Uncertainty Principle to be wider at lower momentum. This scenario can be definitively tested using millisecond pulsars close to the Galactic center, where the Compton frequencies of the heavy and light bosons imprint monotone timing residuals that may be detected by SKA on timescales of approximately 1 week and 4 months, respectively.",
New submissions,Bias hardened estimators of patchy screening profiles,"Noah Sailer,Boryana Hadzhiyska,Simone Ferraro",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Detecting anisotropic screening of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) holds the promise of revealing the distribution of gas in the Universe, characterizing the complex processes of galaxy formation and feedback, and studying the epoch of reionization. Estimators for inhomogeneous screening, including some recently proposed small-scale (stacked) estimators, are quadratic or higher order in the CMB temperature or polarization fields and are therefore subject to contamination from CMB lensing. We review the origin of this lensing bias and show that, when stacking on unWISE galaxies, the expected lensing bias dominates the signal if left unmitigated. Hardening techniques that null the lensing bias have been proposed for standard quadratic estimators, whereas only approximate methods have been proposed for stacked estimators. We review these techniques and apply the former to stacked estimators, presenting several strategies (including the optimal strategy) to null lensing contamination when stacking on any large-scale structure (LSS) tracer.",
New submissions,Impact of the large-scale cosmic web on the X-ray emitting circumgalactic medium,"Soumya Shreeram,Daniela Galárraga-Espinosa,Johan Comparat,Andrea Merloni,Daisuke Nagai,Céline Peroux,Ilaria Marini,Céline Gouin,Kirpal Nandra,Yi Zhang,Gabriele Ponti,Anna Olechowska",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The hot circumgalactic medium (CGM), probed by X-ray observations, plays a central role in understanding gas flows that drive a galaxy's evolution. While CGM properties have been widely studied, the influence of a galaxy's large-scale cosmic environment on the hot gas content remains less explored. We investigate how the large-scale cosmic web affects the X-ray surface brightness (XSB) profiles of galaxies in the context of cosmological simulations. We use our novel IllustrisTNG-based lightcone, spanning $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.3$, first developed in our previous work, and generate self-consistent mock X-ray observations, using intrinsic gas cell information. We apply the filament finder DisPerSE on the galaxy distributions to identify the cosmic filaments within the lightcone. We classify central galaxies into five distinct large-scale environment (LSE) categories: clusters and massive groups, cluster outskirts, filaments, filament-void transition regions, and voids/walls. We find that the X-ray surface brightness profiles (XSB) of central galaxies of dark matter halos in filaments with $M_{\rm 200m} >10^{12}\ M_\odot$ are X-ray brighter than those in voids and walls, with $20-45%$ deviations in the radial range of $\sim (0.3-0.5) R_{\rm 200m}$. We investigate the source of this enhancement and find that the filament galaxies show higher average gas densities, temperatures, and metallicities compared to voids/walls galaxies. Our results demonstrate that the impact of the large-scale cosmic environment is imprinted on the hot CGM's X-ray emission. Future theoretical work on studying the effect of assembly history, connectivity, and gas accretion on galaxies in filaments and voids would help to further our understanding of the impact of the environment on X-ray observations.",

Viable scenarios for baryogenesis and dark matter are also discussed.,
Cross submissions,Observational Constraints on Scalar Field--Matter Interaction in Weyl Integrable Spacetime,Andronikos Paliathanasis,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We test an analytic cosmological solution within the framework of Weyl Integrable Spacetime using current observational data. In this model, dark energy is described by a pressureless fluid, while a scalar field arises naturally through the definition of the connection. This gravitational theory reveals a Chameleon Mechanism leading to a nonzero interaction between the scalar field and the matter sector. This model extends the standard $\Lambda $CDM cosmology by introducing one additional degree of freedom, allowing for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM dynamics. For the observational constraints we consider the Supernova data of Pantheon+ collaboration, the Cosmic Chronometers, the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillators of DESI DR2 collaboration and the gamma-ray bursts. We find that Weyl Integrable Spacetime fits the data in a better way than the $\Lambda$CDM. When all datasets are considered, the statistical comparison indicates a weak to moderate preference for Weyl Integrable Spacetime according to the Akaike Information Criterion and Jeffrey's scale for the Bayesian evidence.",

Intense enough primordial magnetic fields can arise from theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking during the big bang, where supercooling is ended by a strongly first order phase transition. We consider theories involving new scalars and possibly vectors, including thermal particle dark matter candidates. Intense enough magnetic fields can arise if the reheating temperature after the phase transition is below a few TeV. The same dynamics also leaves testable primordial gravitational waves and possibly primordial black holes.",

Of particular interest are low-energy supernovae, characterized by their low explosion energies, which place strong constraints on the new-physics energy transfer from the core to the mantle. We compute low-energy supernova constraints on lepton-flavor-violating axions and axion-like particles that couple to both electrons and muons. For axion mass above the muon mass, the electron-muon coalescence and the axion decay are dominant production and reabsorption processes, respectively. We find that the low-energy supernovae provide the most stringent constraints on the axions in the mass range of $\sim (110,550)$ MeV, probing the coupling constant down to $g_{ae\mu} \simeq {\cal O}(10^{-11})$.",

The first realistic cosmological models were proposed in the works of Friedman, written in the 1920s. For a long time Friedman's cosmological works were actually banned in Soviet Union due to philosophical reasons, since the models where the birth and evolution of the Universe occurs were considered ideologically unacceptable. Due to great achievements in relativity and cosmology and due to increasing interest to these branches of of science in last decades we recall a development of relativistic astrophysics and contribution of Russian researchers in these studies. Since one of the world leaders in physical cosmology A. A. Friedman passed away in September 1925, it is reasonable to outline the main achievements of physical cosmology over the past 100 years. We discuss also observational and theoretical achievements in confirmations of relativistic observational predictions for black holes, including the closest supermassive black hole in our Galactic Center. We outline an evolution of black hole shadow from the purely theoretical concept to observable quantities for supermassive black holes in Sgr A* and M87*.",
Cross submissions,Cosmology of Cubic Poincaré Gauge gravity,"Sebastian Bahamonde,Rebecca Briffa,Konstantinos Dialektopoulos,Damianos Iosifidis,Jackson Levi Said",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this paper, we study flat FLRW cosmology for a Poincaré gauge theory containing cubic invariants that is free from ghosts in arbitrary backgrounds in the axial and vector sectors of the torsion tensor. The new degrees of freedom can be related to hypermomentum but continue to be dynamical even in vacuum. These extra degrees of freedom open a more natural way in which to construct potential gravitational models that provide possible ways to modify astrophysical and cosmological physics. In this framework, we study two particular branches of the theory where preliminary routes of exploring these new variables are exposed. The first is the branch where the hypermomentum vanishes, while the second branch involves the setting where the perfect fluid and hypermomentum parts of the sources are independently conserved. In both settings, we find generically faster expanding cosmologies with similar estimates of the cosmic matter content as in the standard model of cosmology. Cubic Poincaré Gauge gravity offers an interesting theoretical basis on which to study cosmology, and indicates some preliminary positive constraints when compared with observational constraints.",
