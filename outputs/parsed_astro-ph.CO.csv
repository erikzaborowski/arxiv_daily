New submissions,Updated constraints on the primordial power spectrum at sub-Mpc scales,"Torsten Bringmann,Djuna Croon,Sergio Sevillano Muñoz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The primordial power spectrum of matter density perturbations contains highly valuable information about new fundamental physics, in particular cosmological inflation, but is only very weakly constrained observationally for small cosmological scales $k\gtrsim 3\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We derive novel constraints, $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}(k)\lesssim 5\cdot10^{-6}$ over a large range of such scales, from the formation of ultracompact minihalos in the early universe. Unlike most existing constraints of this type, our results do not rest on the assumption that dark matter can annihilate into ordinary matter.",
New submissions,SPT-3G D1: CMB temperature and polarization power spectra and cosmology from 2019 and 2020 observations of the SPT-3G Main field,"E. Camphuis,W. Quan,L. Balkenhol,A. R. Khalife,F.

Zebrowski",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present measurements of the temperature and E-mode polarization angular power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from observations of 4% of the sky with SPT-3G, the current camera on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The maps used in this analysis are the deepest used in a CMB TT/TE/EE analysis to date. The maps and resulting power spectra have been validated through blind and unblind tests. The measurements of the lensed EE and TE spectra are the most precise to date at l=1800-4000 and l=2200-4000, respectively. Combining our TT/TE/EE spectra with previously published SPT-3G CMB lensing results, we find parameters for the standard LCDM model consistent with Planck and ACT-DR6 with comparable constraining power. We report a Hubble constant of $H_0=66.66\pm0.60$ km/s/Mpc from SPT-3G alone, 6.2 sigma away from local measurements from SH0ES. For the first time, combined ground-based (SPT+ACT) CMB primary and lensing data have reached Planck's constraining power on some parameters, a milestone for CMB cosmology. The combination of these three CMB experiments yields the tightest CMB constraints to date, with $H_0=67.24\pm0.35$ km/s/Mpc, and the amplitude of clustering $\sigma_8=0.8137\pm0.0038$. CMB data alone show no evidence for physics beyond LCDM; however, we observe a 2.8 sigma difference in LCDM between CMB and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) results from DESI-DR2, which is relaxed in extended models. The combination of CMB and BAO yields 2-3 sigma shifts from LCDM in the curvature of the universe, the amplitude of CMB lensing, or the dark energy equation of state. It also drives mild preferences for models that address the Hubble tension through modified recombination or variations in the electron mass in a non-flat universe. This work highlights the growing power of ground-based CMB experiments and lays a foundation for further cosmological analyses with SPT-3G.",
New submissions,Dark Classification Matters: Searching for Primordial Black Holes with LSST,"Miguel Crispim Romao,Djuna Croon,Benedict Crossey,Daniel Godines",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.",
New submissions,New bounds on Memory Burdened Primordial Black Holes from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,"Arnab Chaudhuri,Kazunori Kohri,Valentin Thoss",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses below $10^9\,\rm{g}$ are typically assumed to have negligible cosmological impact due to their rapid evaporation via Hawking radiation. However, the 'memory burden' effect, which is a quantum suppression of PBH evaporation, can dramatically alter their decay dynamics. In this work, we revisit early-Universe constraints on ultralight PBHs in this mass range, demonstrating that memory burden significantly alters previous constraints. We compute new cosmological bounds from BBN that strongly limit the presence of ultralight PBHs in the early Universe. We report that the PBHs in the mass range $10^0$-$10^2\,\rm{g}$ for $k=2$ are unconstrained by observations.",
New submissions,Exploring Fermionic Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars in the Light of Astrophysical Observations,"Payaswinee Arvikar(1 and 2),Sakshi Gautam(2 and 3),Anagh Venneti(2),Sarmistha Banik(2) ((1) Dharampeth M. P. Deo Memorial Science College, Nagpur, India (2) Department of Physics, BITS-Pilani Hyderabad Campus, Hyderabad, India (3) Department of Physics, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India)",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We studied the properties of dark matter admixed-neutron stars (DMANS), considering fermionic dark matter (DM) that interacts gravitationally with hadronic matter (HM). Using relativistic mean-field equations of state (EoSs) for both components, we solved the two-fluid Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equations to determine neutron star (NS) properties assuming that DM is confined within the stellar core. For hadronic matter, we employed realistic EoSs derived from low energy nuclear physics experiments, heavy-ion collision data, and NS observations. To constrain key dark matter parameters such as particle mass, mass fraction, and the coupling to mass ratio, we applied Bayesian inference, incorporating various astrophysical data including mass, radii, and NICER mass-radius distributions for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451. Additionally, we explored the influence of high-density HM EoSs and examined the impact of stiffer hadronic EoSs, excluding the vector meson self-interaction term. Our findings indicate that current astrophysical observations primarily constrain the dark matter fraction, while providing limited constraints on the particle mass or coupling. However, the dark matter fraction is largely insensitive to how astrophysical observations or uncertainties in the high-density EoS are incorporated. Instead, it is predominantly determined by the stiffness of the hadronic EoS at high densities, with stiffer hadronic EoSs yielding a higher dark matter mass fraction. Therefore, we conclude that the dark matter fraction plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of DMANS. Future investigations incorporating more realistic EoSs and astrophysical observations of other compact objects may provide deeper insights into dark matter.",
New submissions,The fate of Quasi-Exponential inflation in the light of ACT-DR6,Barun Kumar Pal,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We have revisited quasi-exponential model of inflation in the light of recent ACT-DR6 and Planck-2018 data along with latest constraint on the amplitude of primordial gravity waves. For our analysis we have followed Mukhanov approach for inflationary equation-of-state employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that the model is capable of mimicking Planck-2018 results by providing excellent fit to scalar spectral index and its running. Not only that, amount of primordial gravity waves is also in tune with the present observational bound, $r<0.032$. But, when constraints on scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are considered simultaneously quasi-exponential inflation fails to live up to the Planck-2018 result. However when the combination of ACT-DR6 and Planck-2018 data is taken into account inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model are in excellent agreement. The model also yields sublime fit to the result of joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data. Further the constraint on primordial gravity waves from the futuristic CMB missions in the likes of LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 when combined with ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data renders a first-class match with the inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model of inflation. However, non-detection of primordial gravity waves by LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 will potentially rule out quasi-exponential model.",
New submissions,Planck Constraints on Axion-Like Particles through Isotropic Cosmic Birefringence,"Toshiya Namikawa,Kai Murai,Fumihiro Naokawa",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present constraints on isotropic cosmic birefringence induced by axion-like particles (ALPs), derived from the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization measurements obtained with the high-frequency channels of Planck. Recent measurements report a hint of isotropic cosmic birefringence, though its origin remains uncertain. The detailed dynamics of ALPs can leave characteristic imprints on the shape of the $EB$ angular power spectrum, which can be exploited to constrain specific models of cosmic birefringence. We first construct a multi-frequency likelihood that incorporates an intrinsic nonzero $EB$ power spectrum. We also show that the likelihood used in previous studies can be further simplified without loss of generality. Using this framework, we simultaneously constrain the ALP model parameters, the instrumental miscalibration angle, and the amplitudes of the $EB$ power spectrum of a Galactic dust foreground model. We find that, if ALPs are responsible for the observed cosmic birefringence, ALP masses at $\log_{10}m_{\phi}[{\rm eV}]\simeq-27.8$, $-27.5$, $-27.3$, $-27.2$, $-27.1$, as well as $\log_{10}m_{\phi}[{\rm eV}]\in[-27.0,-26.5]$, are excluded at more than $2\,\sigma$ statistical significance.",
New submissions,Prospects for radio weak lensing: studies using LOFAR observations in the ELAIS-N1 field,"Jinyi Liu,Reinout van Weeren,Huub Rottgering,Konrad Kuijken",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We carry out a shape and weak lensing analysis of Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio sources and Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) optical sources within the European Large Area Infrared Space Observatory Survey-North 1 (ELAIS-N1) field. Using HSC data alone, we detect a cosmic shear correlation signal at a significance of $\sim$$9\sigma$ over a $\sim$$6.4$ deg$^2$ region. For the radio dataset, we analyse observations from both the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT). While LoTSS provides the deepest radio imaging of ELAIS-N1 with a central source density of $\sim$2.7 arcmin$^{-2}$, its $6^{\prime\prime}$ resolution limits the accuracy of shape measurements. But, using LoTSS-matched HSC sources, we show that accurate radio shape measurements would enable us to measure the amplitude of the shear correlation function at least at $\sim$2$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, ILT observation of the field offers a superior $0.3^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. By cross-matching HSC and ILT samples, we measure a position angle correlation of $R_{\cos(2\alpha)} = 0.15 \pm 0.02$. This result highlights ILT's ability to resolve extended and diffuse emission. The current ILT observations lack the required depth for robust weak lensing measurements. To assess the potential of ILT, we use simulated data with increased observation hours. Our analysis indicates that with 3200 hours of ILT observations or deeper data, and assuming that statistical errors dominate over systematics, a shear correlation could be detected with moderate significance. To achieve this will require precise radio shear measurements and effective mitigation of point spread function (PSF) systematics.",
New submissions,Statistical Strong Lensing as a Test of Conformal Gravity,"Li-Xue Yue,Da-Ming Chen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"As an alternative gravitational theory to General Relativity (GR), Conformal Gravity (CG) can be verified through astronomical observations. Currently, Mannheim and Kazanas have provided vacuum solutions for cosmological and local gravitational systems, and these solutions may resolve the dark matter and dark energy issues encountered in GR, making them particularly valuable. For static, spherically symmetric systems, CG predicts an additional linear potential generated by luminous matter in addition to the conventional Newtonian potential. This extra potential is expected to account for the observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters without the need of dark matter. It is characterized by the parameter $\gamma^*$, which corresponds to the linear potential generated by the unit of the solar mass, and it is thus a universal constant. The value of $\gamma^\ast$ was determined by fitting the rotation curve data of spiral galaxies. These predictions of CG should also be verified by the observations of strong gravitational lensing. In this study, building upon the previous research, we tested CG via strong lensing statistics. We used a well-defined sample that consisted of both galaxies and galaxy clusters. This allowed us to test CG through statistical strong lensing in a way similar to the conventional approach in GR. As anticipated, our results were consistent with previous studies, namely that the fitted $\gamma^*$ is much larger than that from rotation curves. Intriguingly, we further discovered that, in order to fit the strong lensing data of another sample, the value of $\gamma^*$ cannot be a constant, as is required in CG. Instead, we derived a formula for $\gamma^*$ as a function of the stellar mass $M_*$ of the galaxies or galaxy clusters. It was found that $\gamma^*$ decreases as $M_*$ increases.",
New submissions,Optimizing Gaussian Process Kernels Using Nested Sampling and ABC Rejection for H(z) Reconstruction,"Jia-yan Jiang,Kang Jiao,Tong-Jie Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent cosmological observations have achieved high-precision measurements of the Universe's expansion history, prompting the use of nonparametric methods such as Gaussian processes (GP) regression. We apply GP regression for reconstructing the Hubble parameter using CC data, with improved covariance modeling and latest study in CC data. By comparing reconstructions in redshift space $z$ and transformed space $\log(z+1)$ , we evaluate six kernel functions using nested sampling (NS) and approximate Bayesian computation rejection (ABC rejection) methods and analyze the construction of Hubble constant $H_0$ in different models. Our analysis demonstrates that reconstructions in $\log(z+1)$ space remain physically reasonable, offering a viable alternative to conventional $z$ space approaches, while the introduction of nondiagonal covariance matrices leads to degraded reconstruction quality, suggesting that simplified diagonal forms may be preferable for reconstruction. These findings underscore the importance of task-specific kernel selection in GP-based cosmological inference. In particular, our findings suggest that careful preliminary screening of kernel functions, based on the physical quantities of interest, is essential for reliable inference in cosmological research using GP.",
New submissions,Low multipole mapmaking for global 21-cm experiments,"Yordan D. Ignatov,Jonathan R. Pritchard",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The 21-cm global signal is obscured by very bright galactic and extra galactic foreground emissions. Typical single-spectrum fit (SSF) based methods for foreground/signal separation can result in biased estimates of the cosmological signal due to the presence of spectral oscillations induced by the interaction between chromatic beams and the spatial shape of the foregrounds. Modelling this interaction requires some amount of assumed foreground information. We present a mapmaking-based approach which describes the beam-weighted observation of the sky by multiple globally-distributed antenna experiments as an observation equation. This equation is inverted in order to estimate the low-order sky modes ($\ell\lesssim10$). The resulting chromaticity-free sky monopole is then fit with a smooth foreground function and a 21-cm model. Given the insensitivity of global 21-cm experiments to small angular scales, we rely on the mean and covariance of higher-order foreground modes being known. We show that this mapmaking-based method is capable of inferring the cosmological signal in cases where a SSF with a simple beam-factor based chromaticity correction fails, even when the foreground model used in the mapmaking method features uncertainty at the 10\% level.",
New submissions,Constraint on Momentum-coupled Dark Energy using DESI DR2,"Prasanta Sahoo,Nandan Roy,Himadri Shekhar Mondal",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we study two scalar field driven dark energy models characterized by the axion potential and the inverse power law potential, each coupled to dark matter through a momentum exchange interaction. By formulating the dynamics as an autonomous system, we identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. To constrain these models, we utilize observational data from Pantheon Plus Type Ia Supernovae, DES Y5, DESI DR2 BAO, and Planck 2018 CMB compressed likelihood, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both potentials exhibit weak to strong preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a particularly strong preference for the momentum-coupled scenario when Supernova data are included in the analysis. Furthermore, we find the coupling parameter to be negative, with no lower bound, for both potentials. This suggests that momentum-exchange coupling between the dark sectors cannot be ruled out. From the stability analysis, we observe that for both potentials, the late-time attractor corresponds to a dark energy dominated phase, and the scalar field can behave as a stiff fluid during the early epoch.",
New submissions,Quasar cosmology II: joint analyses with Cosmic Microwave Background,"M. Benetti,G. Bargiacchi,G. Risaliti,S. Capozziello,E. Lusso,M. Signorini",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Currently, the increasing availability of accurate cosmological probes leads to the emergence of tensions between data on the one hand and between theoretical predictions and direct observations on the other. Moreover, after 25 years since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has elected the $\Lambda$CDM model as the reference model, resolving shortcomings of the standard cosmological model seems to be an unpostponed priority. Hence, it is key to test alternative models and investigate new cosmological probes at distances that range from the late to the early Universe, namely between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. Bargiacchi et al. (2022) for the first time analysed dark energy (DE) models using quasars (QSOs) while also testing their consistency with BAO. Here, we carry on by exploring the compatibility of QSOs with both CMB data and dark energy survey measurements against the standard cosmological model and some DE extensions, such as the $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisations. We also consider an interacting dark matter and vacuum energy scenario, where vacuum energy perturbations affect the evolution of the matter growth rate in a decomposed Chaplygin gas model. We implement the QSO probe in Cobaya Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, using Botzmann solver codes as Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) for the theory predictions. Our work shows that simple DE deviations from $\Lambda$CDM model do not reconcile the data and that only more complex models of interaction in the dark sector can succeed in solving the discrepancies of probes at all scales.",
New submissions,Detectability and Parameter Estimation for Einstein Telescope Configurations with GWJulia,"Andrea Begnoni,Stefano Anselmi,Mauro Pieroni,Alessandro Renzi,Angelo Ricciardone",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are expected to detect tens of thousands of compact binary coalescences (CBC) per year, depending also on the final detectors layout. For this reason, it is essential to have a fast, reliable tool for forecasting how different detector layouts will affect parameter estimation for these events. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is a common tool for tackling this problem. In this paper, we present a new open source code GWJulia to perform FIM analysis of CBC parameters, i.e., stellar black-hole binaries (BBH), neutron star binaries (BNS), and neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH). The code is purely written in Julia, making it fast while maintaining a high level of accuracy. We consider a set of case studies to compare different Einstein Telescope (ET) designs. We compare a 10km triangular configuration with two 15km L-shaped detectors with different orientations and temperatures. We discuss also the accuracy of combinations of parameters, which is very informative for cosmology or population studies. Finally, we focus on the detection of golden events and explore how the FIM can guide posterior sampling of GW signals using a novel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler. The code is publicly available atthis https URL",
New submissions,The Kaleidoscope Survey: Strong Gravitational Lensing in Galaxy Clusters with Radial Arcs,"Catherine Cerny,Mathilde Jauzac,David Lagattuta,Anna Niemiec,Guillaume Mahler,Alastair Edge,Richard Massey",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We measure the dark matter density profiles of six galaxy clusters: A383, MS 2137-23, MACS J0326.8-0043, MACS J1427.6-2521, MACS J0417.5-1154, and MACS J0949.8+1708. Each cluster contains at least one radial arc, a unique physical feature that allows for more precise measurements of the inner mass profile (R < 50 kpc) from strong lensing. We present the first strong lensing analysis for MACS J0326 and MACS J1427. We use a combination of HST imaging and VLT/MUSE observations from the ESO Kaleidoscope Clusters Survey, a large `filler' program, to identify and measure redshifts for multiply-imaged systems and obtain the 2-D stellar velocity dispersion for each centrally-located brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). The BCG kinematics are used to subtract the baryonic mass component from the inner mass profile. We find total mass density profiles consistent with previous works using a combination of strong lensing and BCG kinematics. The overall shape of these profiles appears core-like, with an average dark matter slope measurement of $\gamma$~0.66. These results demonstrate the ongoing need for the construction of observational models for galaxy clusters, and show how galaxy-scale kinematics can be used to disentangle baryonic and dark matter concentrations in cluster cores.",
New submissions,Quintessence and phantoms in light of DESI 2025,"Ioannis D. Gialamas,Gert Hütsi,Martti Raidal,Juan Urrutia,Martin Vasar,Hardi Veermäe",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We analyse DESI BAO, CMB, and supernova data to explore the physical origin of the DESI indication for dynamical dark energy. Beyond the standard CPL parametrization, we explore truncated alternatives and quintessence models. We conclude that there is compelling evidence for dark energy to be decaying in the late universe, but the evidence for a phantom behaviour is less significant. Models without phantom behaviour are compatible with the data at the $2\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we examine a concrete quintessence scenario with a Higgs-like potential, allowing for a direct comparison with parametrized approaches and testing its consistency with current observations. This framework enables a broader investigation of late-time cosmic evolution and reveals a $93.8\%$ preference for a future transition into an anti-de Sitter space, which may ultimately lead to a cosmological collapse of our Universe.",
Cross submissions,Interpreting the 95 GeV resonance in the Two Higgs Doublet Model: Implications for the Electroweak Phase Transition,"Ansh Bhatnagar,Djuna Croon,Philipp Schicho",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate if the recent mass resonance excesses seen around 95 GeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be reconciled with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Performing the first large-scale parameter scan of the Two Higgs Doublet model (2HDM) using high-temperature dimensionally reduced effective field theory, we focus on regions of parameter space consistent with interpreting the excess as an additional pseudoscalar state. We find that, in contrast to the Standard Model, the electroweak transition pattern in the 2HDM is generically first-order, proceeding either in a single or in two steps. While transition strengths can reach up to $v_c/T_c \sim 1.3$, the gravitational wave signals lie below the projected reach of future interferometer experiments and are likely insufficient to support successful electroweak baryogenesis.",
Cross submissions,Test-time Scaling Techniques in Theoretical Physics -- A Comparison of Methods on the TPBench Dataset,"Zhiqi Gao,Tianyi Li,Yurii Kvasiuk,Sai Chaitanya Tadepalli,Maja Rudolph,Daniel J.H. Chung,Frederic Sala,Moritz Münchmeyer",Machine Learning (cs.LG); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel, symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification for tackling complex scientific problems.",
Cross submissions,Close Hyperbolic Encounters In f(R) Gravity,"Jenna Bruton,Peter Dunsby,Alvaro de la Cruz-Dombriz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission from black hole pairs on unbound orbits undergoing close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs) in dense astrophysical environments. While General Relativity predicts gravitational Bremsstrahlung radiation occurring at periastron, the contribution of the scalar gravitational-wave mode in fully general f(R) gravity remains largely unexplored. We characterize the f(R) scalar mode gravitational radiation for both non-precessing and precessing hyperbolic orbits, identifying potential detection signatures for advanced gravitational wave observatories. By systematically varying orbital precession and eccentricity, we examine their influence on the emitted gravitational waves. We derive potentially detectable time delay and scalar-to-tensor amplitude ratio estimates for representative astrophysical environments and determine optimal orbital configurations for the detection of f(R) scalar gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters. Our results provide a theoretical framework for scalar-mode signals and observables, establishing CHEs as a promising probe of f(R) gravity with future detectors.",
Cross submissions,Phantom Crossing and Oscillating Dark Energy with $F(R)$ Gravity,"Shin'ichi Nojiri,S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realised in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint, considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behaviour and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realise an oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study quantitatively two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models, which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behaviour and oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by numerically solving the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity, which can naturally realise a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realise the phantom evolution.",
Cross submissions,On the Dark-Energy Enigma,"Ali H. Chamseddine,Jürg Fröhlich",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lemaître universe are presented.",
Cross submissions,Multifaceted Supercooling: From PTA to LIGO,"Satyabrata Datta,Rome Samanta",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Supercooled phase transitions, as predicted, e.g., in near-conformal and confining extensions of the Standard Model (SM), are established sources of strong stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). In this work, we investigate another facet of such transitions: their significant and largely uncharted impact on gravitational wave spectra originating from independent cosmological sources. Focusing on gravitational waves produced by a metastable cosmic string network, we show that an intervening supercooled phase, initiating thermal inflation, can reshape and suppress the high-frequency part of the spectrum. This mechanism reopens regions of string parameter space previously excluded by LIGO's null results, while remaining compatible with the nanohertz SGWB signal reported by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The resulting total spectrum typically exhibits a dual-component structure, sourced by both string decay and the phase transition itself, rendering the scenario observationally distinctive. We systematically classify the viable parameter space and identify regions accessible to upcoming detectors such as Advanced LIGO, LISA, and ET.",
Cross submissions,Towards Stochastic Inflation in Higher-Curvature Gravity,"Yermek Aldabergenov,Ding Ding,Wei Lin,Yidun Wan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study stochastic inflation in the presence of higher-curvature terms non-minimally coupled to the inflaton. Focusing on quadratic curvature invariants, we single out the Gauss--Bonnet term which is known to avoid ghosts, while having non-trivial effects on the background and scalar mode evolution when coupled to the scalar field. Stochastic Klein--Gordon and Langevin equations are derived in the presence of the Gauss--Bonnet coupling, and their slow-roll and ultra-slow-roll limits are studied. By using first-passage time method, scalar power spectrum is computed in these limits. Stochastic evolution of a Gauss--Bonnet-coupled spectator field in de Sitter vacuum is also discussed.",
