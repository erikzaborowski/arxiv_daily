New submissions,Cosmic Dipoles from Large-Scale Structure Surveys,"Jaiyul Yoo,Matteo Magi(Zürich),Dragan Huterer(Michigan)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Large-scale structure surveys can be used to measure the dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), in the luminosity distances inferred from type-Ia supernova observations, and in the spatial distribution of galaxies and quasars. The measurements of these cosmic dipoles appear to be mutually inconsistent, even though they are expected to indicate the common observer velocity. This observational tension may represent a significant challenge to the standard model of cosmology. Here we study in detail what contributes to the cosmic dipoles from CMB, supernova, and galaxy survey in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, though our theoretical model can be applied beyond the standard model. While measurements of the cosmic dipoles yield the relative velocities between the source samples and the observer velocity, the motion of the observer is the dominant contribution in the conformal Newtonian gauge, and the intrinsic velocities of the samples fall steeply with increasing redshift of the sources. Hence the cosmic dipoles of CMB, type-Ia supernovae, and galaxies should be aligned but can have different amplitudes. We also clarify several misconceptions that are commonly found in the literature.",
New submissions,SLICE: SPT-CL J0546-5345 -- A prominent strong-lensing cluster at $z=1.07$,"Joseph F. V. Allingham,Adi Zitrin,Miriam Golubchik,Lukas J. Furtak,Matthew Bayliss,Catherine Cerny,Jose M. Diego,Alastair C. Edge,Raven Gassis,Michael D. Gladders,Mathilde Jauzac,David J. Lagattuta,Marceau Limousin,Guillaume Mahler,Ashish K. Meena,Priyamvada Natarajan,Keren Sharon",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Massive galaxy clusters act as prominent strong-lenses. Due to a combination of observational biases, cluster evolution and lensing efficiency, most of the known cluster lenses lie typically at $z_{l}\sim0.2-0.7$, with only a few prominent examples at higher redshifts. Here we report a first strong-lensing analysis of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0546-5345 at a redshift $z_l=1.07$. This cluster was first detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, with a high estimated mass for its redshift of $M_{200,c} = (7.95 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. Using recent JWST/NIRCam and archival HST imaging, we identify at least 10 secure and 6 candidate sets of multiply imaged background galaxies, which we use to constrain the mass distribution in the cluster. We derive effective Einstein radii of $\theta_{E}= 18.1 \pm 1.8 ''$ for a source at $z_{s}=3$, and $\theta_{E}= 27.9 \pm 2.8 ''$ for a source at $z_{s}=9$. The total projected mass within a $200$ kpc radius around the strong-lensing region is $M(<200\,\mathrm{kpc}) = (1.9 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. While our results rely on photometric redshifts warranting spectroscopic follow-up, this central mass resembles that of the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters - although SPT-CL J0546-5345 is observed when the Universe was $\sim 3-4$ Gyr younger. Amongst the multiply-imaged sources, we identify a hyperbolic-umbilic-like configuration, and, thanks to its point-like morphology, a possible Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). If confirmed spectroscopically, it will add to just a handful of other quasars and AGN known to be multiply lensed by galaxy clusters.",
New submissions,Magnification bias reveals severe contamination in Hubble Frontier Field photo-z catalogs,"Jiashuo Zhang,Jeremy Lim,Tom Broadhurst,Sung Kei Li,Man Cheung Li,Giorgio Manzoni,Rogier Windhorst",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters enables faint distant galaxies to be more abundantly detected than in blank fields, thereby allowing one to construct galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) to an unprecedented depth at high redshifts. Intriguingly, photometric redshift catalogs (e.g. Shipley et al. (2018)) constructed from the Hubble Frontier Fields survey display an excess of z$\gtrsim$4 galaxies in the cluster lensing fields and are not seen in accompanying blank parallel fields. The observed excess, while maybe a gift of gravitational lensing, could also be from misidentified low-z contaminants having similar spectral energy distributions as high-z galaxies. In the latter case, the contaminants may result in nonphysical turn-ups in UV LFs and/or wash out faint end turnovers predicted by contender cosmological models to $\Lambda$CDM. Here, we employ the concept of magnification bias to perform the first statistical estimation of contamination levels in HFF lensing field photometric redshift catalogs. To our great worry, while we were able to reproduce a lower-z lensed sample, it was found $\sim56\%$ of $3.5 < z_{phot} < 5.5$ samples are likely low-z contaminants! Widely adopted Lyman Break Galaxy-like selection rules in literature may give a 'cleaner' sample magnification bias-wise but we warn readers the resulting sample would also be less complete. Individual mitigation of the contaminants is arguably the best way for the investigation of faint high-z Universe, and this may be made possible with JWST observations.",
New submissions,Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC),"Sinah Legner,Will Handley,Will Barker",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincaré gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.",
New submissions,Modeling the impacts of galaxy intrinsic alignments on weak lensing peak statistics,"Tianyu Zhang,Xiangkun Liu,Ziwei Li,Chengliang Wei,Guoliang Li,Yu Luo,Xi Kang,Zuhui Fan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Weak gravitational lensing (WL) peak statistics capture cosmic non-linear structures and can provide additional cosmological information complementary to cosmic shear two-point correlation analyses. They have been applied to different WL surveys successfully. To further facilitate their high precision applications, it is very timely to investigate the impacts of different systematics on WL peak statistics and how to mitigate them. Concerning the influence from galaxy intrinsic alignments (IAs), in this paper, we develop a theoretical model for WL high peaks taking into account the IA effects. It is an extension of our previous halo-based model. The IA corrections mainly include the modification of the lensing profile of clusters of galaxies due to the alignments of satellite galaxies and the additional shape noise correlations. We validate our model using simulations with the semi-analytical galaxy formation. We consider the cases where the satellite galaxies are averagely radially aligned toward the centers of their host clusters but with different dispersions $\sigma_{\theta}$. We show that our model works well for $\sigma_{\theta}>45^{\circ}$. If the IA corrections are not included in the model, for the Euclid/CSST-like source galaxy distribution and the survey area of $\sim 1000 deg^2$, the IA induced bias on $S_8$ can reach $\sim 8\sigma$ even for $\sigma_{\theta}=75^{\circ}$. With our model, not only the bias can be well mitigated, but also we can constrain the satellite IA to the level of {\bf $\sigma(\sigma_{\theta})\sim \pm 24^{\circ}$} simultaneously from WL high peak analyses alone using data from such a survey.",
New submissions,Anisotropic Universes in Light of Observations,"Jose L. Palacios-Córdoba,J. Bayron Orjuela-Quintana,Gabriela A. Valencia-Zuñiga,César A. Valenzuela-Toledo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The cosmological principle is a cornerstone of the standard cosmological model. However, recent observations suggest potential deviations from this assumption, hinting at a small anisotropic expansion. Such an expansion can arise from sources that break rotational invariance. A minimal realization of this scenario is described by a Bianchi I geometry, where each spatial direction evolves at a different rate, and the degree of anisotropy is quantified by the shear parameter $\Sigma$. In this work, we constrain the present-day value of the shear, $\Sigma_0$, by confronting theoretical predictions with recent cosmological data. We implement various anisotropic models within the Boltzmann code \texttt{CLASS} and explore their parameter space using the sampler \texttt{MontePython}. Although our results show that $\Sigma_0$ is model-dependent, notably, in one specific scenario considering a homogeneous scalar field coupled to a 2-form field, $\Sigma_0 = 0$ is excluded at the $2\sigma$ confidence level, with mean value around $|\Sigma_0| \sim 10^{-4}$ while remaining consistent with observations. These findings challenge the conventional assumption that cosmic shear is negligible in the present universe. Moreover, the anisotropic expansion in this model is driven by a steep scalar field potential, a feature often found in supergravity-inspired scenarios. While anisotropic models offer interesting alternatives and could help explain some cosmological anomalies, they generally introduce additional parameters, making the standard $\Lambda$CDM model statistically favored in most cases. Still, they remain compatible with current observations and provide new perspectives on features not fully explained within the standard framework. These results highlight the importance of further exploring anisotropic cosmologies to better understand their implications.",
New submissions,Probing the scalar-induced gravitational waves with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope and the Square Kilometer Array,"Jun Li,Guang-Hai Guo,Yongcan Zu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational wave astronomy presents a promising opportunity to directly observe scalar-induced gravitational waves originating from the early universe. Future experiments, including ground-based interferometers like LIGO and Virgo, the Pulsar Timing Array, and telescopes such as FAST and SKA, are poised to significantly enhance sensitivity to these gravitational waves. In this paper, we combined Cosmic Microwave Background data with upper or lower limits of the stochastic gravitational wave background provided by FAST or SKA, to constrain scalar-induced gravitational waves. To provide a comprehensive forecast, we consider two scenarios: one where FAST or SKA does not detect scalar-induced gravitational waves, thereby setting an upper limit on the fractional energy density; and another where these waves are detected successfully, thus establishing a lower limit on the fractional energy density. In the $\Lambda$CDM+$r$ model, the scalar spectral index of the power-law power spectrum is constrained to $n_s=0.9589^{+0.0021}_{-0.0011}$ from the combinations of CMB+BAO+SKA datasets in the upper limit scenario. The constraint shifts to $n_s = 0.9661^{+0.0027}_{-0.0039}$ in the lower limit scenario. Comparing with the constraint from the combinations of CMB+BAO datasets, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ exhibits significant changes, which could serve as an indicator for detecting scalar-induced gravitational waves. In the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$r$ model and the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$\beta_s$+$r$ model, the running of the scalar spectral index $\alpha_s$ and the running of the running of the scalar spectral index $\beta_s$ also show notable variations, suggesting potential indicators. The numerical findings clearly demonstrate the impact of the upper and lower limits provided by FAST or SKA.",
New submissions,Eccentric Accretion Disks in Active Galactic Nuclei,Hongping Deng,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Active galactic nuclei (AGNs), among the universe's most luminous objects, radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. They are powered by gravitational energy released from material feeding central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, current AGN theory remains largely phenomenological, relying on envisioned structures beyond accretion disks to produce broad optical emission lines (broad line regions, BLRs) and X-ray emission (corona). It struggles to explain accretion disk sizes, optical line diversity, BLR radial inflows/outflows, and crucially, rapid X-ray and optical variability (line width, line shape, inflow/outflow switch, emitting region) on timescales significantly shorter than disk accretion. Here we show that moderately eccentric flows around SMBHs-formed via circumnuclear gas accretion or tidal disruption events-generate eccentricity cascades in the BLRs (from 0.8 to 0.2 outwards), explaining multi-wavelength emission and variability. The flows' non-axisymmetric temperature structures explain dust sublimation asymmetries, different BLR components and their radial motions. The innermost BLR links to the SMBH vicinity through highly eccentric streams producing soft X-rays at periapsis. General relativistic precession further compresses these flows, generating a hard X-ray continuum near the SMBHs. Precession of the eccentric flow drives optical/X-ray variability, reproducing the observed X-ray power spectral density and occasional X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions. We thus propose eccentric accretion disks as a physical AGN model unifying the elusive BLRs and X-ray corona. This model enables detailed anatomy of AGNs and maximises their potential as cosmological standard candles.",
New submissions,Evidence for Intrinsic Galaxy Alignments in Ellipticity Autocorrelations out to $100 h^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}$ from SDSS Galaxies with DESI Imaging,Teppei Okumura,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Measuring the autocorrelation of galaxy shapes, the so-called intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation is important for both cosmology and understanding the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. However, such measurements are significantly more challenging than the cross-correlation with galaxy density (GI correlation) due to the much lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we report the first observational evidence for large-scale intrinsic alignments measured from the ellipticity autocorrelations, extending out to $100\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. From SDSS and SDSS-III BOSS, we analyze over the redshift range $0.16\leq z\leq 0.70$ luminous red galaxies (LRG), LOWZ and CMASS galaxy samples, the latter two of which are cross-matched with high-quality DESI imaging data. By expanding one of the two II correlation functions, II($-$), in terms of the associated Legendre polynomials, we effectively isolate the line-of-sight projection effects and enhance the signal. The resulting correlation for all three samples exhibits a clear power-law form. We also show that combining the two II correlations, II($+$) and II($-$), increases the detection significance by $\sim 10\%$, though they appear equivalent mathematically under the linear alignment model. Importantly, this measurement opens a new observational window for probing signals uniquely encoded in shape autocorrelations, such as tensor perturbations from the gravitational waves. This analysis establishes a practical framework for probing such effects.",
New submissions,Novel Challenges in Tracking Self-Interacting Dark Matter Subhalos,"Demao Kong,Hai-Bo Yu,Ethan O. Nadler,Philip Mansfield,Andrew Benson",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time. In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations. These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.",
New submissions,Constraining $σ_8$ with Lensing Statistics in Low and High Density Regions,"Yiqi Huang,Fuyu Dong,Jun Zhang,Cong Liu,Hekun Li",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Lensing studies are typically carried out around high density regions, such as groups and clusters, where the lensing signals are significant and indicative of rich density structures. However, a more comprehensive test of the cosmological model should also include the lensing effect in low density regions. In this work, we incorporate the stacked weak lensing signals around the low density positions, alongside galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two point correlation function to perform a joint cosmological analysis on $\sigma_8$. The low density positions are constructed from the DR9 data release of the DESI legacy imaging survey, using galaxies with r-band absolute magnitude cut M$<$-21.5 and in the redshift range of 0.18$<$z$<$0.28. In doing so, we simultaneously parameterize photometric redshift errors and halo mass uncertainties while building mock catalogs from simulations using the method of SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). For the weak lensing measurements, we use the shear estimators derived from the DECaLS DR8 imaging data, processed by the Fourier\_Quad pipeline. The survey boundaries and masks are fully taken into account. Our analysis achieves a total significance of $31.1\sigma$ detection for lensing in the low density positions, which significantly improve the $\sigma_8$ constraint compared to galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two point correlation function by 14$\%$. For flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we constrain $\sigma_8$ =$0.824^{+0.015}_{-0.015}$, which shows a good agreement with the PLANCK result. Additionally, the halo mass uncertainty $\sigma_{\lg M}$ and photometric redshift error $\sigma_z$ are constrained to be $0.565^{+0.086}_{-0.070}$ and $0.004^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ respectively, which are somewhat different from our expectations due to the significant degeneracy of the two parameters.",
New submissions,Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE): A Census of Star Formation and Cold Gas Properties in Massive protoclusters at 1.5<z<4,"Luwenjia Zhou,Tao Wang,Emanuele Daddi,Rosemary Coogan,Hanwen Sun,Ke Xu,Vinodiran Arumugam,Shuowen Jin,Daizhong Liu,Shiying Lu,Nikolaj Sillassen,Sicen Guo,Guillaume Elias,Yijun Wang,Yong Shi,Zhi-Yu Zhang,Qinghua Tan,Qiusheng Gu,David Elbaz,Aurelien Henry,Benjamin Magnelli,Carlos Gomez-Guijarro,Chiara d'Eugenio,Georgios E.

Michael Rich,Jiasheng Huang,Yu Dai,Yanmei Chen,Fangyou Gao,Tiancheng Yang,Qiaoyang Hao",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Massive protoclusters at z~1.5-4, the peak of the cosmic star formation history, are key to understanding the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies in today's clusters. However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts remain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection criteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star formation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive protoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously selected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis reveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} /M_{\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively star-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the field at z>2. We further show that, instead of an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the concentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster cores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main sequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end. Notably, the most massive protocluster galaxies ($M_{\rm halo}$>8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\rm gas}$ and $\tau_{\rm gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star forming main sequence. These gas-rich, massive, and star-forming galaxies are predominantly concentrated in the protocluster cores and are likely progenitors of massive ellipticals in the center of today's clusters. These results suggest that the formation of massive galaxies in such environments is sustained by substantial gas reservoirs, which support persistent star formation and drive early mass assembly in forming cluster cores.",
New submissions,New Insights into Dark Energy from DESI DR2 with CMB and SNIa,"Da-Chun Qiang,Jing-Yi Jia,Hao Wei",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Analyses by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration suggest a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when their baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and various Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples. In this work, we systematically investigate the origin of the deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM reported in recent cosmological analyses by combining different CMB datasets, BAO measurements, and DESY5 SNIa samples within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. We find that the DESY5 SNIa sample, particularly its low-redshift component (DES-lowz), the Planck CMB data, the lensing measurements of Planck and ACT-DR6, and the DESI-DR2 BAO measurements contribute most significantly to the observed tensions. In contrast, combinations involving DES-SN, WMAP, SPT, and ACT-DR6 remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM within $\sim1\sigma$. Our results highlight the critical impact of SNIa systematics, CMB data, and the choice of BAO dataset on constraints of dynamical dark energy models. These findings underscore the importance of improved calibration, homogeneity, and cross-validation of observational datasets to robustly assess potential deviations from the standard cosmological model.",
New submissions,Non-Gaussian Expansion of Minkowski Tensors in Redshift Space,"Stephen Appleby,Christophe Pichon,Pravabati Chingangbam,Dmitri Pogosyan,Changbom Park","Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)","This paper focuses on extending the use of Minkowski Tensors to analyze anisotropic signals in cosmological data, focusing on those introduced by redshift space distortion. We derive the ensemble average of the two translation-invariant, rank-2 Minkowski Tensors for a matter density field that is perturbatively non-Gaussian in redshift space. This is achieved through the Edgeworth expansion of the joint probability density function of the field and its derivatives, expressing the ensemble averages in terms of cumulants up to cubic order. Our goal is to connect these theoretical predictions to the underlying cosmological parameters, allowing for parameter estimation by measuring them from galaxy surveys. The work builds on previous analyses of Minkowski Functionals in both real and redshift space and addresses the effects of Finger-of-God velocity dispersion and shot noise. We validate our predictions by matching them to measurements of the Minkowski Tensors from dark matter simulation data, finding that perturbation theory is a qualified success. Non-perturbative Finger-of-God effects remain significant at relatively large scales (R< 20 Mpc/h) and are particularly pronounced in the components parallel to the line of sight.",
New submissions,"Comparative Study of Structure Formation, Recombination, and Matter--Radiation Equality in \textbf{$f(R, L_m)$} Gravity and \textbf{$Λ$}CDM Cosmology","G. K. Goswami,J. P. Saini",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of three pivotal epochs in cosmic history: structure formation, recombination, and matter-radiation equality, within the framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity and the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using a nonlinear evolution equation for density perturbations, we determine the collapse redshift ($z_c$), showing that cosmic structures form earlier in $f(R, L_m)$ gravity due to enhanced effective gravitational coupling. Recombination is studied via the visibility function $g(z)$, peaking at $z_{\mathrm{rec}} \approx 1092.6$ in both models, consistent with Planck 2018 data. We compute the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $g(z)$ and find a slightly extended decoupling duration in $f(R, L_m)$. Finally, we analyze the evolution of energy densities and determine the matter-radiation equality redshift as $z_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 4203$ in $f(R, L_m)$ and $z_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 2779$ in $\Lambda$CDM, with corresponding cosmic times of approximately $67{,}756$ and $67{,}232$ years, respectively. These results confirm that $f(R, L_m)$ gravity retains key cosmological landmarks while introducing testable deviations from the standard paradigm.",
New submissions,Pristine Massive Star Formation Caught at the Break of Cosmic Dawn,"Takahiro Morishita,Zhaoran Liu,Massimo Stiavelli,Tommaso Treu,Pietro Bergamini,Yechi Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The existence of galaxies with no elements such as Oxygen - formed by stars after Big Bang nucleosynthesis - is a key prediction of the cosmological model. Finding them would provide direct and transformative evidence of the formation of the first galaxies in extremely different conditions than those observed today. JWST has enabled the identification of galaxies all the way to cosmic times of a few hundred million years. However, no pristine ""zero-metallicity"" Population III galaxies have been identified so far. Here, we report the identification of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift z = 5.725 (""AMORE6""), about one billion years after the Big Bang, observed near the critical line of a foreground galaxy cluster, and thus multiply imaged and magnified (mu = 39-78). Publicly available JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) spectra consistently detect H$\beta$ at both image positions, but [O III]4960,5008 remains undetected. This places a firm upper limit on its oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) < 6.0 (1 sigma), or < 0.20% of solar metallicity. AMORE6 is characterized by low stellar mass (5.6+0.2-0.1 x 10^5 Msun), very blue rest-frame UV spectral slope, and extremely compact morphology (effective radius re = 4.0+1.4-1.4 pc). These properties are consistent with massive star formation in a pristine or near-pristine environment. The finding of such an example at a relatively late time in cosmic history is surprising. However, regardless of cosmic epoch, the identification of a potentially pristine object is a key validation of the Big Bang model.",
New submissions,Improved upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at $z=17.0$ and $z=20.3$ from an optimal field observed with NenuFAR,"S. Munshi,F. G. Mertens,J. K. Chege,L. V. E. Koopmans,A.

Zarka",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We report the deepest upper limits to date on the power spectrum of the 21-cm signal during the Cosmic Dawn (redshifts: $z>15$), using four nights of observations with the NenuFAR radio interferometer. The limits are derived from two redshift bins, centred at $z=20.3$ and $z=17.0$, with integration times of 26.1 h and 23.6 h, from observations of an optimal target field chosen to minimise sidelobe leakage from bright sources. Our analysis incorporates improvements to the data processing pipeline, particularly in subtracting strong radio sources in the primary beam sidelobes and mitigating low-level radio frequency interference, yielding a 50-fold reduction in the excess variance compared to a previous analysis of the north celestial pole field. At $z=20.3$, we achieve a best $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^{2}_{21}<4.6 \times 10^5 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.038$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, while at $z=17.0$, the best limit is $\Delta^{2}_{21}<5.0 \times 10^6 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.041$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$. These are the strongest constraints on the 21-cm power spectrum at the respective redshifts, with the limit at $z = 20.3$ being deeper by more than an order of magnitude over all previous Cosmic Dawn power spectrum limits. Comparison against simulated exotic 21-cm signals shows that while the $z=20.3$ limits begin to exclude the most extreme models predicting signals stronger than the EDGES detection, an order-of-magnitude improvement would constrain signals compatible with EDGES. A coherence analysis reveals that the excess variance is largely incoherent across nights for the $z=20.3$ redshift bin, suggesting that deeper integrations could yield significantly stronger constraints on the 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn.",
Cross submissions,Minimal Multi-Majoron Model,"Bowen Fu,Anish Ghoshal,Stephen F. King",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In order to provide a natural framework for hierarchical right-handed neutrinos, we propose a realistic ultraviolet complete minimal multi-Majoron model (MMMM). We consider two right-handed neutrinos for simplicity, although the model is readily extendable to more. The minimal model introduces two complex scalar Majoron fields $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, whose couplings to the two respective right-handed neutrinos are controlled by an extra global $U(1)_N$ symmetry. We show that a flavon field is required to facilitate the effective Yukawa couplings, in order to implement the type I seesaw mechanism. We analyse the resulting phenomenology related to neutrino masses, flavour mixing and cosmological predictions concerning the formation and decay of topological defects like the global cosmic strings and the domain walls when the $U(1)_N\times U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry is broken. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is a distinctive combination of the spectrum from the global cosmic string and strong first-order phase transitions when the symmetries are broken, the strength of the latter being enhanced by the second Majoron field. The resulting characteristic spectrum determines the two right-handed neutrino mass scales within the considered framework.",
Cross submissions,Out of the darkness: probing the inflationary era with dark photon dark matter,"Pierluca Carenza,Tassia Ferreira,Thong T. Q. Nguyen",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"A recent hint reported by the TASEH haloscope suggests the possible detection of dark photon dark matter with mass $19.5~{\rm \mu eV}$. Due to their production during inflation, dark photons act as unique messengers from this primordial epoch. We explore the implications that a confirmed detection would have in directly probing the inflationary era for the first time. To resolve the intrinsic degeneracy between the dark photon mixing parameter and its fractional relic abundance introduced by haloscope measurements, we motivate a next-generation light-shining-through-a-wall experiment. Combining these two experiences with cosmological data, particularly measurements of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to reconstruct dark photon properties. We delineate a coherent strategy for simultaneously determining the dark photon kinetic coupling, abundance, and properties of the inflationary era.",
Cross submissions,A comprehensive dynamical and phenomenological analysis of structure growth in curvature-modulated coupled quintessence scenario,"Anirban Chatterjee,Yungui Gong",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa \rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R^2/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa \phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$. Recasting the cosmological equations into a first-order autonomous system using dimensionless variables, we perform a phase space analysis to identify conditions for stable, non-phantom accelerating attractors. The Ricci scalar term, controlled by $\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast $\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$. Additionally, we compute the deceleration and jerk parameters, the Hubble rate, and the distance modulus $\mu(z)$, showing good agreement with observational data. The model naturally addresses the cosmic coincidence problem through scalar field tracking behavior. For moderate parameter values, matter perturbations continue to grow into the future, capturing both background and perturbative dynamics effectively. This framework thus offers a consistent and observationally viable approach to interacting dark energy.",
Cross submissions,Distinguishing gravity theories with networks of space-based gravitational-wave detectors,"Bo Mu,Zong-Kuan Guo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a method for separating and detecting the non-tensor modes of stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) using networks of space-based gravitational-wave detectors. We consider four distinct data-reconstruction schemes for the co-inclination and anti-inclination orbital configurations of the LISA-Taiji network. We find that the co-inclination configuration offers its advantages over the anti-inclination one and can achieve signal-to-noise ratios up to 17.3 for the vector modes and 10.4 for the scalar modes with the energy density spectrum as $\Omega_{GW}^p(f)=10^{-12}$. Our method can be used to measure beyond-general-relativity polarization modes of SGWBs at mHz frequency band, opening a new avenue for testing alternative gravity theories.",
Cross submissions,Primordial Gravitational Wave Background as a Probe of the Primordial Black Holes,Utkarsh Kumar,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future gravitational wave observatories.",
Cross submissions,Prospects for Joint Multiband Detection of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes by LGWA and the Einstein Telescope,"Yue-Yan Dong,Ji-Yu Song,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band, making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs. We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers. Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$. The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.",
Cross submissions,The multiplicity distributions of the high frequency gravitons,Massimo Giovannini,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"When the gravitons are created thanks to the variation of the space-time curvature the multiplicity distributions quantify the probability of producing a given number of species around the average occupation numbers of the underlying multiparticle states. The multiplicities of the relic gravitons are infinitely divisible and their analytical expressions encompass, in different regions of the physical parameters, the Poisson, Bose-Einstein, Gamma and Pascal probability distributions. Depending upon the post-inflationary timelines, the averaged multiplicities are controlled by the range of the comoving frequencies and they can be much larger in the GHz region than in the aHz domain where the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the microwave background set strict limits on the spectral energy density of the relic gravitons. Thanks to the absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency of the gravitons we can acknowledge that the averaged multiplicities are exponentially suppressed above the THz, where only few pairs of gravitons are independently created from the vacuum. The statistical properties of the produced particles can be finally interpreted in the light of the second-order interference effects and this perspective is quantitatively scrutinized by analyzing the associated quantum sensitivities. For putative instruments reaching spectral amplitudes ${\mathcal O}(10^{-35})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the MHz or GHz bands, the Bose-Einstein correlations could be used to probe the properties of cosmic gravitons and their super-Poissonian statistics. Both from the theoretical and observational viewpoint it is unjustified to require the same sensitivities (e.g. ${\mathcal O}(10^{-21})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$) in the kHz and GHz domains.",
Cross submissions,Waterfall phase in supersymmetric hybrid inflation,"Ahmad Moursy,Qaisar Shafi",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore a class of realistic supersymmetric hybrid inflation models with a predicted scalar spectral index $n_s \approx 0.97-0.978$, which is in good agreement with the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) measurement. The waterfall field responsible for the gauge symmetry breaking in this scenario experiences some $e$-foldings during the inflationary epoch. The scalar perturbations associated with the waterfall field during this phase induce a stochastic gravitational wave spectrum that will be tested in the ongoing Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements and in future experiments. In an $SU(5)$ setting an observable number density of the superheavy GUT monopole linked to the waterfall field can be realized.",
