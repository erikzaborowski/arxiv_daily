New submissions,Introducing NewCluster: the first half of the history of a high-resolution cluster simulation,"San Han,Sukyoung K. Yi,Yohan Dubois,Jinsu Rhee,Seyoung Jeon,J. K. Jang,Gyeong-Hwan Byun,Corentin Cadiou,Juhan Kim,Taysun Kimm,Christophe Pichon",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We introduce NewCluster, a new high-resolution cluster simulation designed to serve as the massive halo counterpart of the modern cosmological galaxy evolution framework. The zoom-in simulation targets a volume of $4.1\sigma$ overdensity region, which is expected to evolve into a galaxy cluster with a virial mass of $5 \times 10^{14} M_\odot$, comparable to that of the Virgo Cluster. The zoom-in volume extends out to 3.5 virial radii from the central halo. The novelties of NewCluster are found in its resolutions. Its stellar mass resolution of $2 \times 10^{4} M_\odot$ is effective for tracing the early assembly of massive galaxies as well as the formation of dwarf galaxies. The spatial resolution of 68 parsecs in the best-resolved regions in the adaptive-mesh-refinement approach is powerful to study the detailed kinematic structure of galaxies. The time interval between snapshots is also exceptionally short-15 Myr-which is ideal for monitoring changes in the physical properties of galaxies, particularly during their orbital motion within a larger halo. The simulation has up-to-date feedback schemes for supernovae and active galactic nuclei. The chemical evolution is calculated for ten elements, along with dust calculation that includes the formation, size change, and destruction. To overcome the limitations of the Eulerian approach used for gas dynamics in this study, we employ Monte Carlo-based tracer particles in NewCluster, enabling a wide range of scientific investigations.",
New submissions,Dating N loud AGNs at high redshift: GS3073 as a snapshot of wCen like evolution of a nuclear star cluster,"F. D'Antona,P. Ventura,A.F. Marino,A.P. Milone,E. Vesperini,F. Calura,M. Tailo,R. Valiante,V. Caloi,A. D'Ercole,F. Dell'Agli",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"In this paper we address two major questions raised by recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of the young Universe, namely: 1) what are the seed initial masses, and how rapidly have supermassive black holes (BHs) with masses of 1e6-1e8Msun grown in active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosted by very young galaxies? 2) What are the plausible explanations for the super solar abundances of nitrogen in a fraction of young galaxies at high redshift, both with and without evidence of a massive central black hole? We focus mainly on the system GS3073. This system shows an exceptionally large log(N/O)=+0.42(+0.13/-0.10) in the gas close to the AGN. We show here that this abundance is consistent with the composition of gas ejected from massive asymptotic giant branch stars. Moreover, this system shows chemical properties matching those expected at a specific point of the evolution of the abundances in the extreme populations of the former nuclear star cluster wCentauri (wCen). This analogy, along with the N/O, C/O and Fe/O abundances in GS3073, lead to an estimate of an age range of 270-440 Myr for this object, much smaller than the redshift (z=5.5) age of about 1 Gyr. We also adopt the same criteria to estimate an age for GNz11. These two determinations constrain the BH mass versus age relation: accretion on the BH must proceed at intermittent superEddington rates in the first phases, and at a much lower rate after the first half gigayear of life of the Universe. The intermittency of accretion is also a fundamental requirement to allow the formation of the extreme (N rich, O depleted, He rich) populations today observed in wCen for a large range of metallicities.",
New submissions,Illuminating Dark Energy with Bright Standard Sirens from Future Detectors,"Samsuzzaman Afroz,Suvodip Mukherjee,Gianmassimo Tasinato",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Understanding the nature and evolution of dark energy (DE) is a central challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the constraining power of bright standard sirens -- gravitational wave (GW) events with electromagnetic counterparts - for probing the DE equation of state as function of redshift. Focusing on future GW observations from next-generation ground-based GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, we perform a comprehensive analysis using simulated binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) events over five years of observation with a $75\%$ duty cycle. We consider three broad classes of DE models: (i) phenomenological parametrizations, specifically the Barboza-Alcaniz extension to the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model; (ii) physically motivated scalar field scenarios, specifically hilltop quintessence; and (iii) evolving dark matter setup in which the matter density evolves as $(1+z)^{3+\alpha}$. For each case, we jointly infer the Hubble constant $H_0$ and model-specific DE parameters from the observed GW luminosity distances and spectroscopic redshifts. Our results demonstrate that bright sirens alone can yield competitive and independent constraints on the time evolution of DE indicating that multi-messenger cosmology has the potential to test a wide range of DE theories, bridging phenomenological and physically motivated models, and paving the way for precision cosmology in the era of GW astronomy.",
New submissions,The EDGE-CALIFA Survey: An integral field unit-based integrated molecular gas database for galaxy evolution studies in the Local Universe,"D. Colombo,V. Kalinova,Z. Bazzi,S. F. Sanchez,A. D. Bolatto,T. Wong,V. Villanueva,N. Mudivarthi,E. Rosolowsky,A. Wei√ü,K. D. French,A. Leroy,J. Barrera-Ballesteros,Y. Garay-Solis,F. Bigiel,A. Tripathi,B. Rodriguez",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Studying galaxy evolution requires knowledge not only of the stellar properties, but also of the interstellar medium (in particular the molecular phase) out of which stars form, using a statistically significant and unbiased sample of galaxies. To this end, we introduce here the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), a collection of integrated stellar and nebular emission lines, and molecular gas properties from 643 galaxies in the local Universe. These galaxies are drawn from the CALIFA datasets, and are followed up in CO lines by the APEX, CARMA, and ACA telescopes. As this database is assembled from data coming from a heterogeneous set of telescopes (including IFU optical data and single-dish and interferometric CO data), we adopted a series of techniques (tapering, spatial and spectral smoothing, and aperture correction) to homogenise the data. Due to the application of these techniques, the database contains measurements from the inner regions of the galaxies and for the full galaxy extent. We used the database to study the fundamental star formation relationships between star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_*$), and molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) across galaxies with different morphologies. We observed that the diagrams defined by these quantities are bi-modal, with early-type passive objects well separated from spiral star-forming galaxies. Additionally, while the molecular gas fraction ($f_{\rm mol}=M_{\rm mol}/M_*$) decreases homogeneously across these two types of galaxies, the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/$M_{\rm mol}$) in the inner regions of passive galaxies is almost two orders of magnitude lower compared to the global values. This indicates that inside-out quenching requires not only low $f_{\rm mol}$, but also strongly reduced SFE in the galactic centres.",
New submissions,AXES-SDSS: Solving the puzzle of X-ray emission of optical galaxy groups via a modified Hausdorff distance,"J. Kosowski,A. Finoguenov,E. Tempel,G. A. Mamon",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The identification of X-ray and CMB sources as galaxy groups and clusters is a prerequisite for cluster cosmology. But the identification of groups, especially nearby ones, suffers from projection effects which in turn affect the purity of the sample. In X-rays, the position of the cluster can be given either by the peak of the emission, or by the full information content of the cluster image. Similarly, the optical center, or its member galaxies, can describe the optical counterpart. With the progress of numerical simulations, it is currently feasible to reproduce both the optical group membership assignment and the behavior of the group outskirts in X-rays, and therefore there is an opportunity to define a reproducible group identification procedure. We performed two-way matching between X-ray contours, drawn at a fixed surface brightness level corresponding to a baryonic overdensity of ~500, to the projected galaxy positions using a modified Hausdorff distance (MHD). We used the volume-limited SDSS group catalog to evaluate the purity and completeness of the procedure, maintaining the constant performance of the optical group finder with redshift. We find that an MHD of 0.631 Mpc provides 90% purity. This is a clear improvement over the methods that rely on the optical counterparts' distance and richness. We study the purity versus MHD and the completeness versus redshift and velocity dispersion. Over half of nearby groups have X-ray emission, even those with velocity dispersions as low as 200km/s; this has never previously been demonstrated. The bulk of these groups follow the same scaling relations as the groups with a small separation between the optical and X-ray centers, removing feedback as an explanation for the lack of matches in previous studies. Instead, the problem is caused by over-merging in the optical group catalog construction and source confusion in X-rays.",
New submissions,Power Law Plateau Inflation and Primary Gravitational Waves in the light of ACT,"Abolhassan Mohammadi,Yogesh,Anzhong Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate Power-Law Plateau (PLP) inflation in standard gravity and its consistency with ACT DR6 data. While many inflationary models, including the Starobinsky inflation, are disfavored by ACT observations, the PLP potential remains viable across a broad range of its parameters. Then, the dynamics of the reheating phase are investigated, where we mainly focus on the reheating temperature and its relationship with the inflationary phase and primordial gravitational waves. Incorporating the overproduction of the primordial gravitational waves can affect the effective number of relativistic species during the bounce. The constraint data on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can impose a lower bound on the reheating temperature. This constraint will be more efficient for a stiff equation of state. It is determined that for $\omega_{re} > 0.58$, this constraint would be efficient. Combining the result of the reheating temperature and the inflationary phase, it is concluded that to have both a viable result standing in $1\sigma$ of ACT DR6 and also to satisfy the reheating lower bound, the total number of e-folds during the inflationary phase should be $N_k \lesssim 62$. Higher e-folds of expansion result in a reheating temperature below the bound, which is disfavored. Finally, for the constraint values of the reheating temperature, the energy spectrum of the gravitational waves has been explored. The results indicate that there is a higher chance of detection for lower reheating temperatures and higher reheating equation of state.",
New submissions,The Bispectrum of Intrinsic Alignments: II. Precision Comparison Against Dark Matter Simulations,"Thomas Bakx,Toshiki Kurita,Alexander Eggemeier,Nora Elisa Chisari,Zvonimir Vlah",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We measure three-dimensional bispectra of halo intrinsic alignments (IA) and dark matter overdensities in real space from N-body simulations for halos of mass $10^{12}-10^{12.5} M_\odot /h$. We show that their multipoles with respect to the line of sight can be accurately described by a tree-level perturbation theory model on large scales ($k\lesssim 0.11\,h$/Mpc) at $z=0$. For these scales and in a simulation volume of 1 Gpc/$h$, we detect the bispectrum monopole $B_{\delta\delta E}^{00}$ at $\sim 30\sigma$ and the two quadrupoles $B_{\delta \delta E}^{11}$ and $B_{\delta \delta E}^{20}$ at $\sim 25\sigma$ and $\sim 15\sigma$, respectively. We also report similar detection significances for the lowest order multipoles of $B_{\delta EE}$ and $B_{EEE}$, although these are largely driven by stochastic contributions. We show that the first and second order EFT parameters are consistent with those obtained from fitting the IA power spectrum analysis at next-to-leading order, without requiring any priors to break degeneracies for the quadratic bias parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of higher multipole moments of $B_{\delta\delta E}$ greatly reduces the errors on second order bias parameters, by factors of 5 or more. The IA bispectrum thus provides an effective means of determining higher order shape bias parameters, thereby characterizing the scale dependence of the IA signal. We also detect parity-odd bispectra such as $B_{\delta \delta B}$ and $B_{\delta EB}$ at $\sim 10 \sigma$ significance or more for $k<0.15\,h$/Mpc and they are fully consistent with the parity-even sector. Furthermore, we check that the Gaussian covariance approximation works reasonably well on the scales we consider here. These results lay the groundwork for using the bispectrum of IA in cosmological analyses.",
New submissions,Measuring cosmic baryon density with FRB and GW data,"Ji-Guo Zhang,Ji-Yu Song,Ze-Wei Zhao,Wan-Peng Sun,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The dispersion measure (DM) analysis of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) has accounted for all cosmic baryons but remains limited by systematic uncertainties from various parameter degeneracies. We show that the prominent degeneracy between the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) and the Hubble constant ($H_0$) can be disentangled through an independent $H_0$ value uniquely inferred from the absolute luminosity distance measurements of gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain a robust, late-Universe measurement of \ob $=0.0488\pm0.0064$ ($1\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN. Notably, incorporating GW data helps not only avoid biases induced by the $H_0$ tension, but also mitigate those from the parameters of diffuse baryon fraction and DM distribution models. Although the current precision ($\sim 13\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of both FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift cosmology.",
New submissions,A Bayesian catalog of 100 high-significance voids in the Local Universe,"Rosa Malandrino,Guilhem Lavaux,Benjamin D. Wandelt,Stuart McAlpine,Jens Jasche",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"While cosmic voids are now recognized as a valuable cosmological probe, identifying them in a galaxy catalog is challenging for multiple reasons: observational effects such as holes in the mask or magnitude selection hinder the detection process; galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution; and it is non-trivial to estimate the detection significance and parameter uncertainties for individual voids. Our goal is to extract a catalog of voids from constrained simulations of the large-scale structure that are consistent with the observed galaxy positions, effectively representing statistically independent realizations of the probability distribution of the cosmic web. This allows us to carry out a full Bayesian analysis of the structures emerging in the Universe. We use 50 posterior realizations of the large-scale structure in the Manticore-Local suite, obtained from the 2M++ galaxies. Running the VIDE void finder on each realization, we extract 50 independent void catalogs. We perform a posterior clustering analysis to identify high-significance voids at the 5$\sigma$ level, and we assess the probability distribution of their properties. We produce a catalog of 100 voids with high statistical significance, available atthis https URL, including the probability distributions of the centers and radii of the voids. We characterize the morphology of these regions, effectively producing a template for density environments that can be used in astrophysical applications such as galaxy evolution studies. While providing the community with a detailed catalog of voids in the nearby Universe, this work also constitutes an approach to identifying cosmic voids from galaxy surveys that allows us to account rigorously for the observational systematics intrinsic to direct detection, and provide a Bayesian characterization of their properties.",
New submissions,Constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy,"Sai Wang,Zhi-Chao Zhao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, by combining \emph{Planck} \& ACT \& SPT CMB data with DESI BAO data. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). We also project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \& CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 0.9 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.",
New submissions,Model-independent observational constraints with fast radio bursts,"L. L. Sales,K. E. L. de Farias,Amilcar Queiroz,Jo√£o R. L. Santos,R. A. Batista,Ana R. M. Oliveira,L. F. Santana,Carlos A. Wuensche,Thyrso Villela,J. Vieira",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This study employs well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) to constrain cosmological parameters using two model-independent methods: the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ with an artificial neural network and cosmography. By integrating FRB data with type Ia supernovae (SNe), BAO from DESI DR2, and cosmic chronometers (CC), we derive constraints on the Hubble constant ($H_0$), deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and jerk parameter ($j_0$). For the reconstruction method, our MCMC analysis with FRB-only provides $H_0 = 69.9 \pm 5.8 \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to a precision of $\sim 8\%$. A joint analysis with FRB+SNe+DESI gives $H_0 = 68.85_{-0.48}^{+0.47} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, reaching a precision below 1\%. The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 65.83_{-4.87}^{+3.77} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.45_{-0.31}^{+0.26}$, and $j_0 = 1.17_{-0.58}^{+0.70}$ with a precision for the Hubble constant of $\sim 6\%$. Besides, the DESI DR2 dataset yields $H_0 = 65.20_{-1.28}^{+1.29} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.29\pm 0.07$, and $j_0 = 0.58_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$, indicating an accuracy of $\sim 2\%$ for the Hubble constant. Combining the FRB, SNe, DESI, and CC datasets provide tighter constraints, e.g., $H_0 = 67.88_{-0.53}^{+0.52} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.42_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$, and $j_0 = 0.56 \pm 0.02$. Notably, these findings provide a statistically significant indication of deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction of $j_0 = 1$, suggesting possible departures from standard cosmology at a $1\sigma$ confidence level. They also confirm a model-independent accelerated expansion ($q_0 < 0$), demonstrating the potential of FRBs as valuable cosmological probes.",
New submissions,Ray-tracing Fast Radio Bursts Through IllustrisTNG: Cosmological Dispersion Measures from Redshift 0 to 5.5,"Ralf M. Konietzka,Liam Connor,Vadim A. Semenov,Angus Beane,Volker Springel,Lars Hernquist",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The dispersion measures (DMs) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) arise predominantly from free electrons in the large-scale structure of the Universe. The increasing number of FRB observations have started to empirically constrain the distribution of cosmic baryons, making it crucial to accurately forward model their propagation within cosmological simulations. In this work, we present a method for measuring FRB DMs in IllustrisTNG that continuously traces rays through the simulation while reconstructing all traversed line segments within the underlying Voronoi mesh. Leveraging this technique, we create over $20$ publicly available DM catalogs, including a full-sky DM map observed from a Milky Way-like environment. Our method addresses a problem in previous TNG-based studies, in which a sparse snapshot sampling in the path integral leads to a misestimation of the standard deviation and higher moments of the DM distribution $p(\rm{DM}|z)$ by over $50\%$. We show that our results are consistent with the most recent observational data from the DSA-110, ASKAP, and CHIME. We offer a functional form for $p(\rm{DM}| z)$ that provides very good fits across all redshifts from $0$ to $5.5$, showing that the previously proposed log-normal distribution is not well matched to the data. We find that using simulation box sizes smaller than $35\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc or resolutions with baryonic masses of less than $5\times10^{8}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ can distort the derived DM signal by more than $8\%$. Our findings provide new insights into how the cosmic web shapes FRB signals, and highlight the importance of accurate methodology when comparing cosmological simulations against observations.",

For decades, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has made a concerted effort to map millions of celestial objects to constrain the physical processes that govern our Universe. The most recent and fifth generation of SDSS (SDSS-V) is organized into three scientific ``mappers"". Milky Way Mapper (MWM) that aims to chart the various components of the Milky Way and constrain its formation and assembly, Black Hole Mapper (BHM), which focuses on understanding supermassive black holes in distant galaxies across the Universe, and Local Volume Mapper (LVM), which uses integral field spectroscopy to map the ionized interstellar medium in the local group. This paper describes and outlines the scope and content for the nineteenth data release (DR19) of SDSS and the most substantial to date in SDSS-V. DR19 is the first to contain data from all three mappers. Additionally, we also describe nine value added catalogs (VACs) that enhance the science that can be conducted with the SDSS-V data. Finally, we discuss how to access SDSS DR19 and provide illustrative examples and tutorials.",
Cross submissions,Road through Dark$ŒΩ$ess: Probing dark matter-neutrino interactions using KM3-230213A,"Ranjini Mondol,Subhadip Bouri,Akash Kumar Saha,Ranjan Laha",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"KM3NeT has recently reported an event where a muon of energy $120^{+110}_{-60}$ PeV was observed at its ARCA detector, which can stem from a very high-energy neutrino interaction in the vicinity of the detector. Besides revolutionizing our understanding of high-energy neutrino sources, this event can serve as a valuable probe for studying Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) interactions of neutrinos. In this work, we study the dark matter (DM)-neutrino interaction by assuming the neutrino for the event KM3-230213A is originated from a blazar. The flux of such neutrinos, traveling through DM distributed across astrophysical and cosmological scales, can get attenuated due to DM interactions. The detection of such event by KM3NeT allows us to place constraints on the interaction cross section at highest-ever neutrino energy. We derive both conservative constraints-neglecting flux attenuation from the host halo-and optimistic ones by including host halo contributions. Our results show that the energy-independent constraints are weaker than previous bounds. For energy-dependent case, the extreme energy of the event allows us to set some of the strongest limits on scattering cross sections. In future, more such neutrino events with well-understood origin will be essential in constraining or potentially discovering DM-neutrino interactions.",
Cross submissions,"Optimal Detection Bands for Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Binaries: Prospects for LISA and AMIGO in General Relativity and $f(R, T)$ Gravity","Marcelo M. Lapola,Oswaldo D. Miranda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a semi analytic forecast for the detection of intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) binaries with the space based detectors LISA (millihertz band) and AMIGO (deci hertz band). A redshift dependent population model is built from extrapolated black hole mass functions and realistic pairing and merger time scales. Folding this population through the instrument sensitivities yields event rates of about 1e4 mergers for LISA in four observing years and between 1e2 and 1e3 mergers for AMIGO in three years, with complementary optimal detection bands in total mass and redshift.We then incorporate the minimal matter coupled modified gravity model f(R,T) = R + 2 lambda T. In this scenario the strain amplitude is rescaled by (1 - lambda / 8 pi)^(5/6) while the waveform phasing is unchanged at leading order. For Solar System compatible couplings abs(lambda) <= 2 x 10^-3, the peak detection redshift shifts by less than one percent and the total number of events changes by less than five percent. Combined statistics from LISA and AMIGO therefore provide a consistency check on f(R,T) gravity without spoiling standard IMBH forecasts.",
Cross submissions,On the stability of de Sitter inflationary solution in the Starobinsky-Bel-Robinson gravity,Tuan Q. Do,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We will present the way to derive a de Sitter inflationary solution within the so-called Starobinsky-Bel-Robinson gravity. Then, we will show by using the dynamical system method whether the obtained solution is stable or not. According to the stability of the de Sitter inflationary solution, we could judge which phase of our universe, among the two early and late-time phases, is more appropriate for this solution.",
Cross submissions,Resonant Landau-Zener Conversion In Multi-Axion Systems,"David I. Dunsky,Claudio Andrea Manzari,Pablo Qu√≠lez,Maria Ramos,Philip S√∏rensen",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Multiple axions may emerge in the low-energy effective theory of Nature. Generically, the potentials describing these axion fields are non-diagonal, leading to mass mixing between axion states which can be temperature-dependent due to QCD instanton effects. As the temperature of the Universe drops, level crossing can occur, causing resonant conversion between axion states. In this work, we present an analytic study of the cosmological evolution of multi-axion systems including adiabatic and non-adiabatic resonant conversion from one axion state into another during the misalignment process. We show how the Landau-Zener formalism accurately captures the non-adiabatic resonant conversion, permitting an analytic description of the relic abundances of each axion field for nearly any arbitrary two-state axion mass matrix. As an application, we study the mixing of a QCD axion with an axion-like-particle for specific potentials to identify the predictions for haloscope experiments. We conclude that the detection of an axion off the expected QCD mass-coupling line predicts other haloscope targets if it mixes with the QCD axion.",
Cross submissions,Dark Walker in the Early Universe: A Strongly Coupled Sector Model,Chen Yang,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if the resulting massive pseudoscalars behave as strongly interacting massive particles (SIMPs). This provides a simple yet concrete example of a strongly coupled sector during inflation.",
Cross submissions,Resolving the QCD Axion Domain Wall Problem with a Light Axion,"Junseok Lee,Kai Murai,Fuminobu Takahashi,Wen Yin",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose two novel solutions to the domain wall problem of the QCD axion by introducing a massless or light axion that also couples to gluons. The first solution applies when the new axion forms strings after inflation. Due to its mixing with the QCD axion, domain walls of the QCD axion are bounded by these strings and confined into cosmologically safe string bundles. This scenario predicts the existence of such string bundles, which may survive until today and leave observable signatures, such as gravitational waves, cosmic birefringence, and CMB anisotropies. The simultaneous detection of the QCD axion and any of these cosmological signatures would serve as a smoking-gun signal. The second solution assumes a homogeneous initial condition for the new axion. If it is sufficiently light, its potential temporarily induces a bias in the QCD axion potential before the onset of oscillations, rendering the domain walls unstable. In both scenarios, the Peccei-Quinn mechanism remains effective, and the strong CP problem is not reintroduced. We identify the viable parameter regions and discuss the resulting dark matter abundance.",
