New submissions,Geometry of non-Gaussianity in transient non-attractor inflation,"Mohammad Hossein Namjoo,Bahar Nikbakht",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Inflationary models predicting abundant primordial black holes (PBHs) and large amplitude of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) often rely on amplified fluctuations over limited scales, typically driven by phase transitions, particle production, or departures from slow-roll evolution. While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak.",
New submissions,An Active Galaxy Cluster Merger at Cosmic Noon Revealed by JWST Weak Lensing and Multiwavelength Probes,"Zachary P. Scofield,Kyle Finner,Hyungjin Joo,M. James Jee,Wonki Lee,Sangjun Cha,Jinhyub Kim,Yu-Heng Lin,Ranga-Ram Chary,Andreas Faisst,Bomee Lee",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The galaxy cluster XLSSC 122 is a rare system at $z = 1.98$, hosting surprisingly evolved member galaxies when the Universe was only one-third of its present age. Leveraging deep JWST/NIRCam imaging, we perform a weak-lensing analysis and reconstruct the cluster's mass distribution, finding a mass peak that coincides with both the X-ray peak and the position of the brightest cluster galaxy. We obtain mass and concentration estimates of $M_{200\rm c}=1.6 \pm 0.3\times 10^{14}~M_{\odot}$ and $c_{200 \rm c}=6.3 \pm 0.3$, respectively, in agreement with recent strong-lensing estimates. The high concentration in particular motivates tests against empirical and simulation-derived mass--concentration relations. Placing our weak-lensing mass map in the context of Chandra X-ray data, MeerKAT radio imaging, ALMA+ACA/ACT Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) mapping, and a new JWST intracluster light measurement, we identify consistent NE--SW elongation across datasets and a pronounced offset along the same axis between the SZ and mass/X-ray peaks, pointing to significant merger activity. XLSSC 122 thus serves as a JWST pilot study for high-$z$ lensing, demonstrating the telescope's unique ability to map cluster mass distributions at $z\sim2$ and motivating a uniform sample of analogous systems with joint lensing, X-ray, SZ, and radio data to probe cluster assembly at Cosmic Noon.",
New submissions,KiDS-Legacy: Constraints on Horndeski gravity from weak lensing combined with galaxy clustering and cosmic microwave background anisotropies,"Benjamin Stölzner,Robert Reischke,Matteo Grasso,Matteo Cataneo,Benjamin Joachimi,Arthur Loureiro,Alessio Spurio Mancini,Angus H.

We study the Horndeski class of modified gravity models in an effective field theory framework employing a parameterisation that satisfies stability conditions by construction and, for the first time, present a cosmological analysis in this inherently stable parameter basis. Cosmic shear constrains the Horndeski parameter space significantly, matching or surpassing the CMB contribution. Adopting the de-mixed kinetic term of the scalar field perturbation, $D_{\rm kin}$, and the deviation of the Planck mass from its fiducial value, $\Delta M_*^2\equiv M_*^2-1$, as model parameters, we constrain their present values to be $\Delta \hat{M}_*^2=0.32^{+0.07}_{-0.21}$ and $\hat{D}_{\rm kin} = 3.74^{+0.69}_{-1.92}$, which deviate from general relativity at $1.5\sigma$ and $1.9\sigma$, respectively. We derive constraints on the structure growth parameter $S_8=0.813^{+0.008}_{-0.011}$, which is compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM constraint at $0.54\sigma$. We obtain the deviation of the effective Newtonian coupling from the GR value as $\Delta \mu_{\infty,{\rm eff}}=0.066\pm0.023$, corresponding to a $2.9\sigma$ significance. Although modified gravity provides a slightly better fit to the data, a model comparison shows only a weak preference for modified gravity at the $1.4\sigma$ level. When adopting a dynamical dark energy model of the background cosmology, the inferred modified gravity parameter constraints are stable with respect to a $\Lambda$CDM background, while a mild preference at $1.57\sigma$ for dynamical dark energy remains.",
New submissions,"KiDS-Legacy: Constraining dark energy, neutrino mass, and curvature","Robert Reischke,Benjamin Stölzner,Benjamin Joachimi,Angus H.

Due to the consistency of the KiDS-Legacy analysis with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can combine these data sets reliably for the first time. Additionally, we use CMB lensing, galaxy redshift-space distortions, and baryon acoustic oscillations. We assess, in turn, the effects of spatial curvature, varying neutrino masses, and an evolving dark energy component on cosmological constraints from KiDS-Legacy alone and in combination with external probes. We find KiDS-Legacy to be consistent with the fiducial flat $\Lambda$CDM analysis with $c^2 \sum m_\nu\leq 1.5\,$eV, $w_0 = -1.0\pm 0.7$ and $w_a = -1.3^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ while $\Omega_K = 0.08^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$ (1$\sigma$ bounds) with almost equal goodness-of-fit. $w_0w_a$CDM is not a significant improvement over $\Lambda$CDM when cosmic shear and CMB lensing are combined, yielding a Bayes factor $B = 0.07$. If all probes are combined, however, $B$ increases to 2.73, corresponding to a $2.6\sigma$ suspicousness tension. The constraint on $S_8 = \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3}$ is robust to opening up the parameter space for cosmic shear. Adding all external datasets to KiDS-Legacy, we find with $S_8 = 0.816 \pm 0.006$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $S_8 = 0.837 \pm 0.008$ in $w_0 w_a$CDM for all probes combined.",
New submissions,Milky Way Globular Clusters: Nurseries for Dynamically-Formed Binary Black Holes,"Federico Angeloni,Konstantinos Kritos,Raffaella Schneider,Emanuele Berti,Luca Graziani,Stefano Torniamenti,Michela Mapelli",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a novel self-consistent theoretical framework to characterize the formation, evolution, and merger sites of dynamically-formed black hole binaries, with a focus on explaining the most massive events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5. This cosmic evolution is a crucial signature with significant implications for future detectors like the LISA, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, which will be capable to probe the high-redshift Universe.",
New submissions,Constraints on the intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi-LAT observations of GRB 221009A,"Lea Burmeister,Paolo Da vela,Francesco Longo,Guillem Marti-Devesa,Manuel Meyer,Francesco Saturni,Antonio Stamerra,Peter Veres",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.",
New submissions,Insights for Early Dark Energy with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,"Christopher Cook,Joel Meyers",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), as one of the earliest processes in the universe accessible to direct observation, offers a powerful and independent probe of the cosmic expansion history. With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe.",
New submissions,Cosmological Implication of Cross-correlation between Galaxy Clustering and 21-cm Line Intensity Mapping,"Yong-Seon Song,Minji Oh,Kyungjin Ahn,Feng Shi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The apparent anisotropies of galaxy clustering and 21-cm mapping in redshift space offer a unique opportunity to simultaneously probe cosmic expansion and gravity on cosmological scales through the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD). Although improved theoretical models exist for anisotropic clustering, their applicability is limited by the non-perturbative smearing effect caused by the randomness of relative velocities. Here, we consider an alternative approach using the statistical power of cross-correlation between galaxy clustering and 21-cm line intensity mapping. Based on Fisher matrix analysis, fully incorporating nonlinear RSD, we estimate the benefit of combining both observables. We find that, for spectroscopy surveys like DESI combined with 21-cm line-intensity mapping surveys, the constraint on the growth of structure is improved by a factor of two relative to the galaxy auto-correlation, while the constraint on the cosmic expansion is only slightly improved. Crucially, such an observation can strongly constrain the neutral hydrogen (HI) content Omega_HI to a sub-percent level. This level of precision unlocks the potential of this method to probe post-reionization astrophysics with enhanced precision. It would far surpass existing constraints from stacked 21-cm emission (resulting in ~ 50%-100% uncertainties) and break the degeneracy between Omega_HI and the HI bias b_HI inherent in linear-regime power spectrum analysis. This cross-correlation approach effectively compensates for the loss of constraining power when using galaxy clustering alone.",
New submissions,Observational evidence of tidal torque in the primordial Universe,"Ming-Jie Sheng,Hao-Ran Yu,Min Bao,Bing-Hang Chen,Fang-Na Shao,Qi Guo,Yanmei Chen,Huiyuan Wang,Ue-Li Pen,Jie Wang,Xiaohu Yang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy angular momenta are imprinted by the early tidal field acting on their proto-structures, which are preserved through cosmic evolution and provide the potentially most precise measurement of the early universe. We test this prediction using the gas component of central massive elliptical galaxies, whose angular momenta respond sensitively to external torques. By comparing the observed gas angular momentum vectors with those predicted from the primordial density field reconstructed by ELUCID for the nearby universe, we conclusively detect a strong direction correlation with a significance of about $7\sigma$. These results provide the first robust observational confirmation of TTT and open a new window for cosmological measurements of neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters.",
New submissions,Intergalactic magnetic field lower limits up to the redshift $z\approx3$,Ievgen Vovk,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Large-scale intergalactic magnetic fields may contain a mixture of galactic and cosmogenic contributions, that can be probed via observations of $\gamma$-ray ""echo"" from sources at cosmological distances. While these contributions may be disentangled based on the difference in their redshift evolution, thus far indications of non-negligible magnetic field have been found only at low redshifts. This work aims at extending the intergalactic magnetic field constraints to redshifts $z\gtrsim 1$ using 17-year long all-sky observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei with Fermi/LAT $\gamma$-ray telescope. Combing the Fermi/LAT measurements in the 0.1 GeV - 1 TeV energy range with the Monte Carlo simulations of the $\gamma$-ray ""echo"", it is shown that the zero field strength hypothesis at $z = [0.5; 3]$ is disfavoured at the $\approx 9\sigma$ significance level, yielding the lower limit of $B \gtrsim 1\times10^{-18}$ cG for the magnetic field correlation length above 1 Mpc. It is further shown that the same data put a lower limit on the volume-filling fraction of this field of $f\gtrsim 90\%$ in the redshift range considered. It is also demonstrated that the derived limits are not substantially affected by either source flux variability or the assumed $\gamma$-ray emission attenuation model. Implications of these limits for intergalactic magnetic field origin are discussed.",
New submissions,The magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal in the context of existing early and late time constraints on $Λ$CDM,H. T. J. Bevins,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The dark ages 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the currently unobserved infant universe between the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background around $z \approx 1100$ and the first galaxies around $z\approx 30$. A detection of the signal will help researchers understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the expansion of the universe and any extensions to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the reported Cosmic Dawn 21-cm signal from EDGES and the Hubble tension. In this letter we take existing constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model from two early time probes, Planck and WMAP, and two late time probes, DES galaxy lensing and clustering and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and propagate these through to constraints on the magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal. We constrain the magnitude and central frequency of the signal while methodically accounting for uncertainties in the cosmological parameters. We find that within the context of our modelling assumptions and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the depth of the dark ages 21-cm signal is known to better than 1 mK and the central frequency to within 0.05 MHz.",
New submissions,Dark sector interactions in the $w \rightarrow -1$ limit: velocity locking in pure momentum exchange models,"Nathan Cruickshank,Robert Crittenden,Kazuya Koyama,Marco Bruni",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Models of interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) involving pure momentum exchange are a promising avenue for resolving cosmological tensions. However, the behaviour of these interactions in the theoretically challenging limit where the DE equation of state, $w$, approaches $-1$ is not fully understood. We demonstrate that a generic feature of these models is a $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism, which systematically shifts the onset of matter power spectrum suppression to smaller scales as $w \rightarrow -1$. The suppression magnitude depends on the difference in fluid velocities. In this limit, however, the interaction's drag dominates over the DE pressure support and causes the DE velocity to track that of the DM fluid at larger scales. This mechanism provides a physical explanation for the weaker constraints found in the literature when $w\approx-1$ in models where the interaction strength does not explicitly depend on $w$. We also demonstrate that the common approximation of neglecting DE perturbations ($\delta_{\mathrm{DE}}=\theta_{\mathrm{DE}}=0$) fails in this limit. By artificially increasing the velocity difference between the fluids, this simplification incorrectly removes the $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism and erases the shift in power spectrum suppression to smaller scales. This leads to an overestimation of the constraining power of cosmological data on the interaction strength.",
New submissions,The multiphase interstellar medium as a common origin for magnetic misalignment and TB parity violation,"Andrea Bracco,Ari J. Cukierman,Raphael Skalidis,François Boulanger",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present an original data analysis and a physical model that provide new insights into the origin of, and relationship between, two observables of the dusty, polarized Galaxy at intermediate and high latitudes: (i) the misalignment between HI filamentary structures and magnetic fields and (ii) the positive $TB$ correlation measured in Planck data suggesting parity violation in the interstellar medium (ISM). We confirm an observational link between the two effects and find that both are predominantly produced at large angular scales ($\geq 10^\circ$, multipoles $\ell \leq 20$) with a significantly stronger signal in the northern hemisphere.We propose a model in which filaments and magnetic fields appear misaligned in projection because they are sourced by cold and warm gas phases distributed in different proportions in the Solar neighborhood, from the wall of the Local Bubble to larger distances. These projection effects at large angular scales can produce coherent signatures that propagate to smaller scales in power spectra without invoking local, small-scale filament misalignment. Within this frame, HI filaments remain statistically aligned with the magnetic field in 3D, although with a projected scatter of tens of degrees that requires further investigation.The multiphase, geometrical model presented in this work is supported by Planck polarization data at 30 GHz, where synchrotron radiation dominates, and at 217 and 353 GHz, where dust emission dominates. Our analysis also incorporates starlight polarization measurements. The model introduced here suggests a new interpretation of two unexplained observables and emphasizes the role of the large-scale magnetized ISM in shaping polarized Galactic emission, which has important implications for both Galactic astrophysics and cosmological foreground characterization.",
New submissions,One-loop power spectrum corrections in interacting dark energy cosmologies,"Emanuelly Silva,Gabriel Hartmann,Rafael C. Nunes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models offer a promising avenue to explore possible exchanges of energy and momentum between dark matter and dark energy, providing a dynamical extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm m}$ and $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = \Gamma \, \rho_{\rm m} \, \rho_{\rm DE} \, \theta_{\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $\Gamma$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $\Gamma$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $\Gamma = 0.0039 \pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work opens the possibility of testing IDE models at mildly non-linear scales, potentially providing new insights for this class of models beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.",
New submissions,The Domain Adaptation problem in photometric redshift estimation: a solution applied to the HSC Survey,"M. Treyer,R. Ait-Ouahmed,S. Arnouts,J. Pasquet,E. Bertin,G. Desprez,V. Picouet,M. Sawicki",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The multi-band HSC-CLAUDS survey comprises several sky regions with varying observing conditions, only one of which, the COSMOS Ultra Deep Field (UDF), offers extensive redshift coverage. We aim to exploit a complete sample of labeled galaxies from the COSMOS UDF at i<25 (z<~5) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and infer more accurate photometric redshifts in the other regions than those currently available from SED-fitting methods. To address the severe domain mismatch problem we observed when applying the trained CNN to regions other than the COSMOS UDF, we developed an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation network that we grafted onto the CNN. The method is validated by three tests: the predicted redshifts are compared to the spectroscopic redshifts that are available for limited samples of mostly bright galaxies; the predicted redshift distributions of the entire galaxy population of a given field in several intervals of magnitude are compared to those of the COSMOS UDF, assumed to be representative; the redshifts predicted for a sample of galaxies selected by narrow-band filter observations sensitive to [OII] emitters at z~1.47 are compared to those of confirmed [OII] emission line galaxies. The results show successful domain adaptation: the network is able to transfer its redshift classification capability learnt from the COSMOS UDF to other regions of HSC-CLAUDS. Accuracy varies depending on magnitude and redshift, following that of the labels we used, but far exceeds that of currently available photometric redshifts. The catalogs of CNN redshifts we inferred for the XMM, DEEP2 and ELAIS fields and for the remaining COSMOS region (~4 million sources in total at i<25) are made public.",
New submissions,GLIMPSE-D: An Exotic Balmer-Jump Object at z=6.20? Revisiting Photometric Selection and the Cosmic Abundance of Pop III Galaxies,"Seiji Fujimoto,Yoshihisa Asada,Rohan P.

Furtak,Johan Richard,Alessandra Venditti,Volker Bromm,Angela Adamo,Adelaide Claeyssens,Miroslava Dessauges-Zavadsky,Qinyue Fei,Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao,Damien Korber,Julian B. Munoz,Richard Pan,Alberto Saldana-Lopez",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \pm 0.47$ mag) and H$\alpha$ equivalent width ($3750\pm1800$ Å), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1\sigma$ involve a hot ($T_{\rm eff}\!\simeq\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.",
New submissions,Solving the Cosmological Vlasov-Poisson Equations with Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Nicolas Cerardi,Emma Tolley,Ashutosh Mishra",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Cold dark matter (CDM) evolves as a collisionless fluid under the Vlasov-Poisson equations, but N-body simulations approximate this evolution by discretising the distribution function into particles, introducing discreteness effects at small scales. We present a physics-informed neural network approach that evolves CDM fields without any use of N-body data or methods, using a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to model the continuous displacement field for one-dimensional halo collapse. Physical constraints derived from the Vlasov-Poisson equations are embedded directly into the loss function, enabling accurate evolution beyond the first shell crossing. The trained model achieves sub-percent errors on the residuals even after seven shell crossings and matches N-body results while providing a resolution-free representation of the displacement field. In addition, displacement errors do not grow over time, a very interesting feature with respect to N-body methods. It can also reconstruct initial conditions through backward evolution when sufficient final-state information is available. Although current runtimes exceed those of N-body methods, this framework offers a new route to high-fidelity CDM evolution without particle discretisation, with prospects for extension to higher dimensions.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Foundations and Exact Solutions in $n$--Dimensional Fractional Cosmology,"S. M. M. Rasouli,J. Marto,D. Oliveira,P. Moniz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Three theoretically plausible techniques to developing a fractional scalar field cosmological model are pointed in this paper; the time-dependent kernel weighted action being then selected. Upon this choice, we proceed to establish a fractional cosmological model in $n$ dimensions considering the FLRW metric and a generalized version of the Sáez-Ballester (SB) theory. Our study focuses on the following purposes. Firstly, to investigate the fundamental gravitational structural features of the model, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the field equations, the fulfillment of the Bianchi identities, the associated conservation laws, and the application of the second Noether theorem at the background and first-order perturbation levels. Moreover, the model's distinguishing characteristics and theoretical differences from the corresponding standard scenarios are also investigated.Secondly, we aim to obtain exact analytical solutions and analyze the time evolution of key cosmological quantities, considering the integration constants influence, and the number of spacetime dimensions, and the fractional parameter effects. Furthermore, the model's predictions are compared with those of the corresponding standard models and observational data.Lastly, we propose new ideas to further generalize our model, with a focus on constructing an effective potential and investigating the conditions under which bounce solutions may emerge.",
