New submissions,Euclid preparation. Accurate and precise data-driven angular power spectrum covariances,Euclid Collaboration,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We develop techniques for generating accurate and precise internal covariances for measurements of clustering and weak lensing angular power spectra. These methods are designed to produce non-singular and unbiased covariances for Euclid's large anticipated data vector and will be critical for validation against observational systematic effects. We construct jackknife segments that are equal in area to high precision by adapting the binary space partition algorithm to work on arbitrarily shaped regions on the unit sphere. Jackknife estimates of the covariances are internally derived and require no assumptions about cosmology or galaxy population and bias. Our covariance estimation, called DICES (Debiased Internal Covariance Estimation with Shrinkage), first estimates a noisy covariance through conventional delete-1 jackknife resampling. This is followed by linear shrinkage of the empirical correlation matrix towards the Gaussian prediction, rather than linear shrinkage of the covariance matrix. Shrinkage ensures the covariance is non-singular and therefore invertible, critical for the estimation of likelihoods and validation. We then apply a delete-2 jackknife bias correction to the diagonal components of the jackknife covariance that removes the general tendency for jackknife error estimates to be biased high. We validate internally derived covariances, which use the jackknife resampling technique, on synthetic Euclid-like lognormal catalogues. We demonstrate that DICES produces accurate, non-singular covariance estimates, with the relative error improving by $33\%$ for the covariance and $48\%$ for the correlation structure in comparison to jackknife estimates. These estimates can be used for highly accurate regression and inference.",
New submissions,"Tiny galaxies and dark substructures: exploring the ""dark"" subhaloes in TNG50","Jessica E. Doppel,Mathilde Jauzac,David J. Lagattuta,Azadeh Fattahi,Guillaume Mahler",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Dark matter haloes and subhaloes that host no luminous counterpart are predicted within our current understanding of galaxy formation within a $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Observational tests, such as gravitational lensing, have made potential detections of such objects around individual galaxies as well as in galaxy groups and clusters. The question of whether or not a dim counterpart might reside in these objects remains an open question. We investigate this point using the TNG50-1 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project. Under the assumption of TNG50's galaxy formation model, we do not find haloes or subhaloes above a total mass of $\rm 10^{9.7} \ M_{\odot}$ that are entirely dark. However, under realistic effective surface brightness cuts of $\rm \leq 29 \ mag \ arcsec^{-2}$, the inference of the most massive dark subhalo in galaxy groups and clusters becomes $\rm M_{DM} \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$. Concentrating on galaxy groups and clusters, we find that dark subhaloes are ubiquitous with more massive dark subhaloes tending to preferentially reside further from the centers of clusters. We find that subhaloes in the mass range of $\rm 4.5 \times 10^{7} \leq M_{DM}/M_{\odot} \leq 2.1\times 10^{8}$ tend to be the most likely to reside in the strong lensing regions of galaxy groups and clusters, and argue that future dark subhalo searches should investigate this mass range.",
New submissions,Computing Nonlinear Power Spectra Across Dynamical Dark Energy Model Space with Neural ODEs,Peter L. Taylor,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"I show how to compute the nonlinear power spectrum across the entire $w(z)$ dynamical dark energy model space. Using synthetic $\Lambda$CDM data, I train a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to infer the evolution of the nonlinear matter power spectrum as a function of the background expansion and mean matter density across $\sim$$9 {\rm \ Gyr}$ of cosmic evolution. After training, the model generalises to {\it any} dynamical dark energy model parameterised by $w(z)$. With little optimisation, the neural ODE is accurate to within $4\%$ up to k = $5 \ h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Unlike simulation rescaling methods, neural ODEs naturally extend to summary statistics beyond the power spectrum that are sensitive to the growth history.",
New submissions,Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources,"Lorenz Zwick,Kai Hendriks,David O'Neill,János Takátsy,Philip Kirkeberg,Christopher Tiede,Jakob Stegmann,Johan Samsing",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e> 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.",
New submissions,Distinguishing Orbiting and Infalling Dark Matter Particles with Machine Learning,"Ze'ev Vladimir,Calvin Osinga,Benedikt Diemer,Edgar M. Salazar,Eduardo Rozo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Dark matter halos are typically defined as spheres that enclose some overdensity, but these sharp, somewhat arbitrary boundaries introduce non-physical artifacts such as backsplash halos, pseudo-evolution, and an incomplete accounting of halo mass. A more physically motivated alternative is to define halos as the collection of particles that are physically orbiting within their potential well. However, existing methods to classify particles as orbiting or infalling suffer from trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and generalizability across cosmologies. We present an efficient, yet accurate, supervised machine learning approach using decision trees. The classification is based on only the particle radii and velocities at two epochs. Compared to detailed analysis of particle trajectories, we find that our model matches the classification of 97\% of particles. Consequently, we are able to quickly and accurately reproduce the density profiles of the orbiting and infalling components out to many virial radii. We demonstrate that our model generalizes to a significantly different cosmology that lies outside the training dataset. We make publicly available both our final model and the code to train similar models.",
New submissions,Mitigating antenna gain errors with HyFoReS in CHIME simulations,"Haochen Wang,Panupong Phoompuang,Kiyoshi W. Masui,Arnab Chakraborty,Simon Foreman",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Hybrid Foreground Residual Subtraction (HyFoReS) is a new family of algorithms designed to remove systematics-induced foreground contamination for 21-cm intensity mapping data. Previously, the algorithm was shown to be effective in mitigating beam perturbations in sky maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). In this study, we apply HyFoReS to CHIME simulations and test the algorithm's ability to mitigate antenna gain-type systematics in polarized visibilities. Simulating a two-cylinder telescope similar to the CHIME pathfinder, we find that HyFoReS reduces foreground bias caused by bandpass perturbations to a level below the thermal noise, provided that the RMS value of the perturbations is on the order of $10^{-4}$ or lower. When tested with complex antenna-dependent gain errors, HyFoReS can reduce residual foreground bias in the power spectrum by up to three orders of magnitude. While noise bias and second-order perturbations are currently the limiting factors for the algorithm, we have demonstrated that HyFoReS can suppress gain-induced foreground leakage in polarized data from 21-cm telescopes, aiding in the detection of the 21-cm auto-power spectrum for hydrogen intensity mapping experiments.",
New submissions,$w_{dm}$-$w_{de}$ cosmological model with new data samples of cosmological observations,"Dorian Araya,Cristian Castillo,Genly Leon,Juan Magaña,Angie Barr Domínguez,Miguel A. García-Aspeitia",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We revisit a cosmological model where dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) follow barotropic equations of state, allowing deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework (i.e. $w_{dm} \neq 0$, $w_{de} \neq -1$) considering both, flat and non-flat curvature. Using a dynamical system approach, we identify equilibrium states that govern stability, expansion, and contraction. Expansion occurs when $H>0$, while contraction is linked to $H < 0$. Accelerated expansion arises from DE dominance, whereas radiation- and matter-dominated phases lead to deceleration. Some solutions are unphysical, because of density constraints, but viable cases offer insights into cosmic transitions, including the Einstein static universe, which allows shifts between accelerating and decelerating phases. We perform a Bayesian analysis with updated datasets, including observational Hubble data, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing systems, and baryon acoustic oscillations, to constrain the parameters $w_{dm}$ and $w_{de}$. Our results from the data joint analysis show consistency with $\Lambda$CDM within $3\sigma$, but none of the cases reproduce $w_{dm} = 0$ and $w_{de} = -1$. Nevertheless, the comparison with the standard model using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicates that only the non-flat scenario has the potential to be competitive. This suggests that a non-dust-like DM may impact structure formation, while DE could shift toward quintessence fluid. While $\Lambda$CDM remains a strong model, our findings indicate that alternative dark sector models with non-standard EoS could be viable and offer new insights into cosmic evolution.",
New submissions,Fullshape power spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model,"Gerardo Morales-Navarrete,Jorge L. Cervantes-Cota",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We make use of the perturbation theory for modified gravity models that we developed in previous works and apply it to construct the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model. First, we study the growth rate, that is a scale dependent quantity, and compare our results with those of the $n=1 $ Hu-Sawcki (HS) model, finding that the Symmetron has a growth quite similar to the HS F6 in the wavenumber interval $0.01 \leq k \leq 0.1 $ and for redshifts where Symmetron model is viable. We also propose a growth parametrization that turns to be a good approximation for the HS and Symmetron models, with a deviation less than $0.6 \%$. To compute the RSD multipoles we employ an expansion of the velocity moments generating function that is suitable for general modified gravity models. Later, we apply the fk-Perturbation Theory (fkPT) approximation to reduce the computation time of nonlinear kernels, to find the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron, and study the differences with HS model. The RSD multipoles of the Symmetron result similar to those of the HS F6 model. Next, we integrate this theory to an MCMC sampler and validate our results by fitting our parameters to EZMocks to recover the parameters that bring the model to GR. We found a similar agreement in the model validation between Symmetron and F6 model, recovering the simulation cosmological parameters, and concluding that our pipeline is ready to make cosmological parameters' inference with real data.",
New submissions,Imaging systematics induced by galaxy sub-sample fluctuation: new systematics at second order,"Hui Kong,Nora Elisa Chisari,Boris Leistedt,Eric Gawiser,Martin Rodríguez-Monroy,Noah Weaverdyck",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Imaging systematics refers to the inhomogeneous distribution of a galaxy sample caused by varying observing conditions and astrophysical foregrounds. Current mitigation methods correct the galaxy density fluctuations, caused by imaging systematics assuming that all galaxies in a sample have the same galaxy density fluctuations. Under this assumption, the corrected sample cannot perfectly recover the true correlation function. We name this effect sub-sample systematics. For a galaxy sample, even if its overall sample statistics (redshift distribution n(z), galaxy bias b(z)), are accurately measured, n(z), b(z) can still vary across the observed footprint. It makes the correlation function amplitude of galaxy clustering higher, while correlation functions for galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear do not have noticeable change. Such a combination could potentially degenerate with physical signals on small angular scales, such as the amplitude of galaxy clustering, the impact of neutrino mass on the matter power spectrum, etc. Sub-sample systematics, cannot be corrected using imaging systematics mitigation approaches that rely on the cross-correlation signal between imaging systematics maps and the observed galaxy density field. In this paper, we derive formulated expressions of sub-sample systematics, demonstrating its fundamental difference with other imaging systematics. We also provide several toy models to visualize this effect. Finally, we discuss the estimation and mitigation of sub-sample systematics, with a combination of synthetic source injection (SSI), analytical benchmarking on SSI, and self-organizing map.",
New submissions,SKA-Low simulations for a cosmic dawn/epoch of reionisation deep field,"Anna Bonaldi,Philippa Hartley,Simon Purser,Omkar Bait,Eunseong Lee,Robert Braun,Florent Mertens,Andrea Bracco,Wendy Williams,Cath Trott",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present a realistic simulation of an SKA-Low cosmic dawn/epoch of reionisation (CD/EoR) observation, which can be used to further the development of foreground-mitigation approaches. The simulation corresponds to a deep (1000 h) integration pointing over the 106 MHz-196 MHz frequency range. The sky components include the CD/EoR signal, extragalactic foreground emission featuring strong (over 5 Jy at 150 MHz) out-of-field sources and in-field sources down to 1 microJy at 150 MHz, and Galactic emission from the GSM2016 model complemented with small-scales structure beyond its native $\sim 1$ deg resolution from a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of the interstellar medium. Modeled errors include a partial de-mixing of the out-of-field sources, direction-dependent calibration errors leading to residual ionospheric effects, and direction-independent gain calibration errors, on top of thermal noise. Simulated observations are delivered as visibilities as well as imaging products with natural weighting. The true, uncorrupted, CD/EoR signal is also delivered, to allow an assessment of the efficacy of foreground-mitigation approaches. The codes used to generate these simulations are also delivered, so that new simulated datasets can be produced. This simulation has been the basis for the SKA Science Data Challenge 3a (SDC3a), which addressed foreground removal.",
New submissions,CSST Cosmological Emulator II: Generalized Accurate Halo Mass Function Emulation,"Zhao Chen,Yu Yu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Accurate theoretical prediction for halo mass function across a broad cosmological space is crucial for the forthcoming China Space Station Telescope (CSST) observations, which will capture cosmological information from multiple probes, e.g., cluster abundance, and weak lensing. In this work, we quantify the percent-level impact of different mass binning schemes when measuring the differential halo mass function from simulations, and demonstrate that the cumulative form of the halo mass function is independent of the binning scheme. Through the recently finished Kun simulation suite, we propose a generalized framework to construct multiple accurate halo mass function emulators for different halo mass definitions, including $M_{200m}$, $M_{vir}$, and $M_{200c}$. This extends our CSST Emulator to provide fast and accurate halo mass function predictions for halo mass $M\geq 10^{12}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ up to $z=3.0$. For redshifts $z\leq 1.0$, the accuracy is within $2\%$ for $M\leq 10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, $5\%$ for $M\leq 10^{14}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, and $10\%$ for $M\leq 10^{15}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, which is comparable with the statistical errors of training simulations. This tool is integrated in CSST Emulator and publicly available atthis https URL.",
New submissions,Is non-zero equation of state of dark matter favored by DESI DR2?,"Tian-Nuo Li,Yi-Min Zhang,Yan-Hong Yao,Peng-Ju Wu,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The nature of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in modern cosmology. In most cosmological models, dark matter is typically modeled as pressureless dust with an equation of state (EoS) parameter $w_{\rm dm} = 0$. However, there is no fundamental theoretical reason to exclude the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS parameter. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS within the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model, given its simplicity and proven ability to alleviate the Hubble tension. We perform observational constraints by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. From our analysis, we observe that a negative dark matter EoS parameter is preferred in all scenarios. Specifically, the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.00093 \pm 0.00032$, deviating from zero at approximately the $3\sigma$ level. However, this deviation is likely driven by unidentified systematics or inconsistencies in the DESY5 data, with the deviation decreasing to $2\sigma$ when using PantheonPlus data. Meanwhile, a negative $w_{\rm dm}$ would increase the Hubble tension due to the positive degeneracy between $w_{\rm dm}$ and $H_0$. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly preferred over the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model. These analyses illustrate that it is not possible to both support a non-cold dark matter component within the PEDE model and alleviate the Hubble tension simultaneously.",
Cross submissions,Light PIDM in Warped Extra Dimensions,"Mathew T Arun,Prachiti P. Athalye,Basabendu Barman",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Traditional Planckian Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM), which interacts exclusively through gravity, typically requires heavy DM candidates (with mass $10^3-10^{15}$ GeV) and very high reheating temperature ($T_{\rm rh}\gtrsim 10^{15}$ GeV). In this article, we explore a novel realization of PIDM in warped five-dimensions, consisting of an ""Ultra Violet""$-$""Dark""$-$""Infra Red"" (UV-DB-IR) brane setup, where the DM can be a Dark brane composite light state with mass 1 MeV $-$ 1 TeV. The DM sector is assumed to interact solely via gravity in five-dimensions. After orbifolding and performing a Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition, the DM is assumed to be localized onto the DB, which is positioned in the extra-dimension such that the DM interacts with both the massless graviton and its massive KK excitations, with suppressed couplings to remain consistent with the ethos of the PIDM framework. The light (heavy) Standard Model matter is assumed to be localized near UV (IR) branes for the geometric Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, while their KK modes are localized close to the IR brane. We show that this construction allows for a viable and efficient freeze-in production mechanism for light composite PIDM, consistent with TeV-scale reheating temperature.",
Cross submissions,Cosmological Histories in Neutrino Portal Dark Matter,"Amro E. B. Abdelrahim,Brian Batell,Joshua Berger,David McKeen,Barmak Shams Es Haghi",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore the diverse cosmological histories of a dark sector that is connected to the Standard Model (SM) via a Dirac sterile neutrino. The dark sector consists of a complex scalar and a Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) candidate protected by a global $U(1)$ stabilizing symmetry. Assuming the dark sector has negligible initial abundance and is populated from reactions in the SM thermal plasma during the radiation era, we show that the cosmological histories of the dark sector fall into four qualitatively distinct scenarios, each one characterized by the strengths of the portal couplings involving the sterile neutrino mediator. By solving Boltzmann equations, both semi-analytically and numerically, we explore these thermal histories and transitions between them in detail, including the time evolution of the temperature of the dark sector and the number densities of its ingredients. We also discuss how these various histories may be probed by cosmology, direct detection, indirect detection, collider searches, and electroweak precision tests.",
Cross submissions,Distinguishing Monochromatic Signals in LISA and Taiji: Ultralight Dark Matter versus Gravitational Waves,"Heng-Tao Xu,Yue-Hui Yao,Yong Tang,Yue-Liang Wu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is an attractive candidate for cold dark matter, one of the main mysterious components of the Universe. Recent studies suggest that gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers can also detect bosonic ULDM fields, which would produce monochromatic signals resembling those from gravitational waves (GWs). Distinguishing between these potential origins therefore would be essential. In this work, we develop a method to address this challenge for space-based GW interferometers (such as LISA and Taiji) by utilizing the null-response channel (NRC) in interferometric combinations, a channel constructed to have zero response to a specific type of source from a given direction. We find that while the GW NRC remains blind to GWs from a specific direction, it still responds to ULDM, particularly at frequencies above the interferometer's critical frequency. The ULDM NRC exhibits similar behavior. Based on these observations, we outline a test procedure to discriminate between signal origins. Our method provides a new diagnostic tool for analyzing monochromatic signals in space-based GW interferometers, potentially expanding the scientific scope of future missions.",
Cross submissions,Black hole photon ring beyond General Relativity: an integrable parametrization,"Jibril Ben Achour,Eric Gourgoulhon,Hugo Roussille",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In recent years, the shape of the photon ring in black holes images has been argued to provide a sharp test of the Kerr hypothesis for future black hole imaging missions. In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr geometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole parameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that end, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the Kerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the fundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides exhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the representants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of Petrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are encoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar angle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the radial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve, to which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to derive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term of the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result, we confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like objects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given inclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass and spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin parameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\alpha$. Therefore, future tests of the Kerr hypothesis could be achieved only provided one can measure independently the mass and spin of the black hole to break this degeneracy.",
