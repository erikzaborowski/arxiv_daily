New submissions,Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $ΔN_{eff}$ Bounds,"Ido Ben-Dayan,Utkarsh Kumar,Amresh Verma",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $>3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.",
New submissions,Electron-Ion Equilibration in the Merging Galaxy Cluster Abell 665,"Christian Norseth,Daniel R. Wik,Craig L. Sarazin,Ming Sun,Fabio Gastaldello",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Galaxy cluster mergers drive powerful shock fronts that heat the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) and accelerate particles, redistributing the energy in a merger. Abell 665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock ($M \sim 3$) and provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization timescale of the ICM, particularly the electron-ion equilibration timescale. Understanding this timescale is crucial for determining how energy from the merger is distributed between thermal and non-thermal particle populations. Using $\sim$200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature distribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an instant, collisionless model where ions and electrons are immediately heated at the shock front, and (2) a collisional model where electrons are initially adiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the ions over $\sim$100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed equilibration model, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium with the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over $t_{eq} = (4.0 \pm 3.4) \times 10^8$ yrs. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate that the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ($M = 2.8 \pm 0.7$), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past studies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing how thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with implications for galaxy cluster evolution, large scale structure formation, and cosmology.",
New submissions,Interaction of polytropic dark energy in cosmological model: Constraints from observational data,"Elangbam Chingkheinganba Meetei,S. Surendra Singh",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate an interacting polytropic dark energy (PDE) model characterised by the equation of state $p_{d} = \alpha \rho_{d}^{\,1+\frac{1}{\beta}}$, where the interaction between dark energy and pressureless matter is modelled via a linear coupling term $Q = 3\eta H\rho_{d}$. The background dynamics are formulated by deriving the Hubble parameter in the interacting scenario, and the model parameters are constrained through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three joint observational data sets: Hubble77+BAO26, Hubble77+Pantheon$^+$, and Hubble77+BAO26+DESI DR2. The resulting best-fit values of $(H_0, \Omega_{d0}, \eta) $ are $(69.22^{+1.27}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.22^{+0.10}_{-0.12})$, $(69.23^{+1.27}_{-1.22},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.34^{+0.15}_{-0.17})$, and $(67.77^{+1.26}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,\\-0.02^{+0.10}_{-0.11})$ respectively for the respective data combinations. Our results indicate a positive energy density and negative pressure over the full redshift range, with the evolution of the equation-of-state parameter and state finder parameters placing the model firmly within the Quintessence regime. The study of the deceleration parameter also reveals a shift from a decelerating to an accelerating cosmic expansion. The estimated present age of the Universe is $14\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, consistent with recent observational data. Furthermore, the sign of $Q$ implies a current energy transfer from dark energy to matter. These findings support the interacting PDE framework as a viable candidate for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration and related large-scale dynamics.",
New submissions,Measurement of circumgalactic extinction in the Kilo-Degree Survey's Data Release 4,"Eray Genc,Angus H. Wright,Hendrik Hildebrandt",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxies reside in extended dark matter halos, but their baryonic content, especially dust, remains less well understood. We aim to investigate the amount and distribution of dust in galactic halos by measuring shifts in the observed magnitudes of background galaxies. Dust absorbs and scatters shorter-wavelength light, reddening background sources. We quantify this effect using multi-band magnitude shifts in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 4, distinguishing it from achromatic magnification. Our pipeline is validated using MICE2 mock catalogues, and we explore potential systematics arising from galaxy selection, in contrast to previous quasar-based studies. Simulations show that input halo and dust masses can be recovered independently and jointly using galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) and magnitude shifts. A minimum redshift separation of $\Delta z_{\mathrm B}\sim0.3$ and brightness cuts are required to minimise overlap effects and the effects of photometric noise, respectively. Applying our pipeline to KiDS data, we first confirm the achromaticity of magnitude shifts in five near-infrared filters ($ZYJHK_{\rm s}$). In optical bands ($ugri$), joint analysis constrains halo mass and dust mass to $0.2$ dex and $0.3$ dex, respectively, yielding $M_{\rm dust}=7.24^{+0.52}_{-0.64} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ and $\log(M_{\rm halo}^{\rm DM}/M_\odot)=12.33^{+0.08}_{-0.04}$. These results agree with previous studies and represent the first successful measurement of magnitude shifts and halo extinction with KiDS, confirming that galaxies reside in extended baryonic halos enriched by gas and dust from feedback processes.",
New submissions,Using gravitational wave dark sirens to choose between host galaxy weighting models,"Zhuotao Li,Rachel Gray,Ik Siong Heng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Binary black hole (BBH) mergers,, an important source of gravitational-waves(GWs), are assumed to be hosted in galaxies. The probability of a galaxy to host a BBH is related to its properties, for example stellar mass and star formation rate. These properties can be estimated from observables, such as the luminosity in certain observation bands. We refer to this description of host galaxy properties as host galaxy weighting models. However, the host galaxy weighting model for BBHs has yet to be accurately determined. Population synthesis has provided a variety of host galaxy weighting models. Here we investigate whether it is possible to distinguish different host galaxy weighting models using a data driven approach. We use the GW cosmology tool gwcosmo with a simulated IGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) fifth observing run (O5)-like observing scenario. We also construct a mock spectroscopic galaxy catalogue from MICECATv2. Our analysis compares the Bayes factors among three simple luminosity weighting models, r-band, g-band, and uniform weighting. The Bayes factors among different host galaxy weighting models show a minor preference for the true model for a ~200-detection case, and a decisive preference for the true model over the uniform model for a ~1000-detection case, which is strongly driven by a small number of well-localised events.",
Cross submissions,Classical constant electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter,"Mar Bastero-Gil,Paulo B. Ferraz,António Torres Manso,Lorenzo Ubaldi,Roberto Vega-Morales",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study constant classical electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter space, with potential implications for magnetogenesis and inflationary dark matter production. Treating the photon as a dynamical field, we show that sustaining a constant electric field in de Sitter requires a tachyonic photon mass of order the Hubble scale. This observation has physical implications, as it alters the infrared behaviour of the induced Schwinger current. Using an on-shell renormalization condition consistent with a tachyonic photon, we recompute the current for charged fermions and scalars, finding it to be finite and positive even in the massless limit of the charge carriers-contrary to earlier results predicting a puzzling negative IR divergence. For scalars, we include a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci curvature, enabling us to analyze the conformal limit, where the current closely matches that of charged fermions.",
Cross submissions,Cosmology with an emergent Standard Model,Steven D. Bass,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We discuss new ideas that the Standard Model might be emergent with connection to electroweak vacuum stability and related consequences for cosmology. In this scenario, the gauge symmetries and particles of the Standard Model would be ``born'' in some phase transition at a large scale about $10^{16}$ GeV with the Standard Model parameters constrained by the requirement of vacuumthis http URLgauge symmetries are well known in condensed matter physics. Perhaps the Standard Model might also be emergent. In this case the particles would be the stable long range excitations of degrees of freedom that operate above the scale of emergence. The dark energy scale comes out with similar size to the tiny masses of light Majorana neutrinos. The emergence scenario comes with interesting constraints on possible dark matter structure. New physics at energy scales around $10^{16}$ GeV might be explored through its effects in the neutrino mass matrix plus using high frequency gravitational waves and polarisation observables in the cosmic microwave background.",
