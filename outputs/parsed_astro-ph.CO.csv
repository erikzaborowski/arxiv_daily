New submissions,Not-quite-primordial black holes,"Wenzer Qin,Soubhik Kumar,Priyamvada Natarajan,Neal Weiner",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a new mechanism for the formation of seeds of supermassive black holes at early cosmic epochs. Enhanced density fluctuations with amplitudes that are not large enough to form primordial black holes post-inflation can still lead to collapsed dark matter halos at very early times. For halos forming prior to $1+z \approx 200$, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is energetic enough to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen, hence preventing cooling and fragmentation, as a consequence of which baryons falling into the potential well of the halo may undergo ""direct collapse"" into a black hole. We show using a few illustrative models how this mechanism may account for the abundance of high-redshift black holes inferred from observations by the James Webb Space Telescope while remaining consistent with current limits from CMB spectral distortions. Limits on the primordial power spectrum are also derived by requiring that the universe not reionize too early.",
New submissions,Feature Intensity Mapping: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission from All Galaxies Across Cosmic Time,"Yun-Ting Cheng,Brandon S. Hensley,Thomas S.-Y. Lai",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the aggregate emission of a spectral line from all sources, without requiring individual detections. Through the wavelength-redshift relation, one can map the line-of-sight evolution of the line emission that traces the underlying large-scale structure in a spectral-imaging survey. In this work, we present a new technique -- feature intensity mapping -- as an extension of the LIM formalism to map broad spectral features in 3D, rather than the narrow emission lines typically targeted by LIM. By accounting for the convolution of spectral features with the instrument's spectral response across redshift, our technique enables simultaneous constraints on the redshift-dependent emission from multiple features. This approach enables 3D intensity mapping with some of the brightest features in galaxies' infrared spectra: the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands. We forecast the detectability of PAH signals using feature intensity mapping with the ongoing SPHEREx mission in the near-infrared and the proposed PRIMA mission in the far-infrared. We find that $S/N$ of $\gtrsim 10$ per redshift bin of widths $\Delta z = 0.1$ and $0.5$ can be achieved at $z < 0.5$ and $1 < z < 5$ with SPHEREx and PRIMA, respectively, for multiple PAH features, suggesting a promising prospect for mapping the aggregate PAH emission at cosmological distances with upcoming datasets.",
New submissions,Beyond diagonal approximations: improved covariance modeling for pulsar timing array data analysis,"Marco Crisostomi,Rutger van Haasteren,Patrick M. Meyers,Michele Vallisneri",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for nHz gravitational-wave backgrounds (GWBs) typically model time-correlated noise by assuming a diagonal covariance in Fourier space, neglecting inter-frequency correlations introduced by the finite observation window. We show that this diagonal approximation can lead to biased estimates of spectral parameters, especially for the common red process that represents the GWB. To address these limitations, we present a method that (i) computes the time-domain autocorrelation on a coarse grid using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), (ii) interpolates it accurately to the unevenly sampled observation times, and (iii) incorporates it into a low-rank likelihood via the Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury identity. Using both analytic covariance comparisons and end-to-end simulations inspired by the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we demonstrate that our method captures frequency correlations faithfully, avoids Gibbs ringing, and recovers unbiased spectral parameters with modest computational cost. As PTA datasets increase in sensitivity and complexity, our approach offers a practical and scalable path to fully accurate covariance modeling for current and future analyses.",
New submissions,Extreme AGN feedback in the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436,"D. Eckert,F. Gastaldello,L. Lovisari,S. McGee,T. Pasini,M. Brienza,K. Kolokythas,E. O'Sullivan,A. Simionescu,M. Sun,M.

Tempel",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Supermassive black hole feedback is the currently favoured mechanism to regulate the star formation rate of galaxies and prevent the formation of ultra-massive galaxies ($M_\star>10^{12}M_\odot$). However, the mechanism through which the outflowing energy is transferred to the surrounding medium strongly varies from one galaxy evolution model to another, such that a unified model for AGN feedback does not currently exist. The hot atmospheres of galaxy groups are highly sensitive laboratories of the feedback process, as the injected black hole energy is comparable to the binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we report multi-wavelength observations of the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436. The hot atmosphere of this system exhibits a highly relaxed morphology centred on the giant elliptical galaxy NGC~3298. The X-ray emission from the system features a compact core ($<$10 kpc) and a steep increase in the entropy and cooling time of the gas, with the cooling time reaching the age of the Universe $\sim15$ kpc from the centre of the galaxy. The observed entropy profile implies a total injected energy of $\sim1.5\times10^{61}$ ergs, which given the high level of relaxation could not have been injected by a recent merging event. Star formation in the central galaxy NGC~3298 is strongly quenched and its stellar population is very old ($\sim$10.6 Gyr). The currently detected radio jets have low power and are confined within the central compact core. All the available evidence implies that this system was affected by giant AGN outbursts which excessively heated the neighbouring gas and prevented the formation of a self-regulated feedback cycle. Our findings imply that AGN outbursts can be energetic enough to unbind gas particles and lead to the disruption of cool cores.",
New submissions,MeerKAT HI observations of Low Surface Brightness/Ultradiffuse Galaxy Candidates Projected around Two Southern Loose Groups,"Chandreyee Sengupta,Tom C. Scott,Hao Chen,Hyein Yoon,Yogesh Chandola,Mengtian Li,Gyula I. G. JÃ³zsa,O. Ivy Wong,Yin-Zhe Ma,Patricio Lagos,Ruta Kale,Denis Tramonte",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A large catalogue of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) from the Dark Energy Survey showed significant clustering around nearby galaxy groups and clusters. Using the HIPASS survey, we tried to determine the redshift of a sub-sample of these LSBGs and determine whether they were members of the groups they were projected near, but this was hampered by HIPASS's high spectral rms. This letter reports on MeerKAT H I observations to determine the redshifts of 52 LSBG candidates projected in the vicinity of two groups from our previous HIPASS study. The main goal is to investigate and ascertain whether these LSBGs are genuine group members. H I was detected with MeerKAT and redshifts were determined for only five of the 52 candidates within a velocity range of $\pm$ 2500 km/s of their respective group velocities. All five H I detections were blue LSBGs and two of them were confirmed to be ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs). Both these UDGs were group members, while the other three detections were either foreground or background galaxies. In this letter we explore scenarios that can explain the 90% non-detection. MeerKAT's excellent sensitivity allows us to conclude that the majority of the non-detected candidates, particularly the blue galaxies, are not group members but lie at higher redshifts. However, this still leaves the open question as why Tanoglidis LSBG candidates, in particular the red ones, appear to be clustered in projection around nearby groups.",
New submissions,"The DORCHA suite: nature, nurture, and the phase space distribution of the Milky Way's high redshift progenitors today","Sreedhar Balu,Chris Power,Kris Walker,J. Stuart B. Wyithe",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Where in the present-day Milky Way should we search for the remnants of its earliest stars? We address this question using the DORCHA (Gaelic for Dark; DUR-uh-khuh) suite: a set of 25 high-resolution, dark-matter-only cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogue (MWA) haloes evolved to $z=0$. Of these, 15 are isolated and the rest are in pairs, similar to the MW and M31. By identifying and tagging the most bound material in high-redshift ($z\geq5$) progenitor haloes -- those likely to host early star formation -- we track the present-day phase-space distribution of this ancient component. We find that this material is highly centrally concentrated at $z=0$, with 90 - 100 per cent residing within $r \lesssim 15\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}$. It exhibits steep density profiles ($\rho\propto\,r^{-4}$), low velocity dispersions ($\sigma_r / \sigma_{\rm max} \lesssim 0.6$), and radially biased orbits ($\beta \gtrsim 0.5$ for $r \gtrsim 0.1\,R_{200}$), consistent with a relaxed, centrally embedded population. These results hold across haloes with diverse formation histories and environments, suggesting that the dynamical signature of early progenitors is robust to later mergers and interactions. Our findings imply that the fossil record of the first generations of stars -- including Population III and extremely metal-poor stars -- should be sought in the innermost regions of the Milky Way, where they retain distinctive kinematic imprints. While these stellar populations may overlap, we caution that low metallicity does not uniquely identify ancient stars, nor vice versa. The DORCHA suite thus provides a physically motivated baseline for interpreting observations from Galactic Archaeology surveys targeting the bulge and inner halo.",
New submissions,Hawking Radiation Signatures from Primordial Black Holes Transiting the Inner Solar System: Prospects for Detection,"Alexandra P. Klipfel,Peter Fisher,David I. Kaiser",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Primordial black holes (PBHs) arise from the collapse of density perturbations in the early universe and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate and a probe of fundamental physics. There remains an unconstrained ``asteroid-mass'' window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} {\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \lesssim 5\times10^{17}\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \, {\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \, {\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.",
New submissions,Precise Hubble constant measurement from quasi-periodic eruptions as electromagnetic counterparts to extreme mass ratio inspirals,"Yejing Zhan,Di Wang,Shuang-Xi Yi,Fa-Yin Wang",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts provide a novel methodology to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens. However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Here we study the secular orbital evolution of QPE systems under different theoretical frameworks, and assess their GWs detectability by LISA. We find that LISA can detect the EMRI signals of two or three known QPE systems with a four-year observation. One EMRI event can measure the $H_0$ with an uncertainty of $3\%-8\%$ at a 68.3 percent confidence level, while a few events will reduce it below $2\%$. The EMRI events surpass current bright siren limitations and offer an independent pathway to resolve the Hubble constant tension.",
New submissions,DESI results and Dark Energy from QCD topological sectors,"Ludovic Van Waerbeke,Ariel Zhitnitsky",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a physically motivated model of dark energy (DE) rooted in the topological structure of the Quantum ChromoDynamic (QCD) vacuum. In this framework, DE emerges as the Universe expands, from the difference in vacuum energy between the expanding Universe and Minkowski spacetime, driven by QCD vacuum topological sectors. This leads to a modification of the dark energy term in the Friedmann equation, which then scales with the Hubble parameter as $\rho_{\rm DE}(t) \propto H(t)$ when dark energy dominates the expansion of the Universe. The QCD scale, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD} \sim 100~{\rm MeV}$, naturally sets the energy density of DE and provides a compelling explanation for why its impact on cosmic expansion becomes significant only in the recent cosmological epoch. Importantly, the entire framework is grounded in Standard Model (SM) physics, involving no new fields or coupling constants. Key predictions of the model include: (a) A present-day DE equation of state $w_{\rm DE} > -1$, asymptotically approaching the de Sitter limit $w_{\rm DE} = -1$ in the future, with the corresponding asymptotic Hubble constant $\overline{H}$ set by $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. (b) At redshifts $z \ge 0$, $w_{\rm DE}$ can lie above or below $-1$ and may cross this boundary multiple times, behavior qualitatively consistent with recent DESI observations. (c) The solution to the Friedmann equation in this framework can deviate from the canonical $\Lambda$CDM form at $z \ge 0$. (d) If such deviation occurs, it can be tested using cosmological observations, CMB anisotropies, BAO, SNIa, and large-scale structure, which we propose to explore in future work. (e) Finally, we point out a potential connection between our framework and the observed $H_0$ tension.",
New submissions,Reverberation responses in light curves of the SBS1520+530 quasar,"Liudmyla Berdina,Victoria Tsvetkova",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Purpose: We aim to investigate an accretion disk (AD) temperature profile of a doubly lensed quasar SBS 1520+530. Temperature profiles of accretion disks are known to be diagnostic of many of the physical properties of AGNs and quasars. Methods: Our approach involves application of the photometric reverberation mapping to the light curves of SBS 1520+530 obtained in the Johnson-Cousins V and R filters. The RM method implies that the time shift between the light curves taken in different spectral ranges determines the light travel time between the AD zones with different physical conditions. In determining the time shifts, we applied a method based on some useful properties of the orthogonal polynomials. Results: The variations in filter R lag those in filter V , with 1.25$\pm$ 0.63 days for the inter-band time shift averaged between the two image components and over the three seasons. The obtained time lag noticeably exceeds the value following for SBS 1520+530 from the classical model of optically thick geometrically thin AD. We considered two possible ways to resolve the discrepancy between the theory and observations. The first assumes an AD temperature profile flatter than the classical one. The second way is to consider an extended optically thick scattering envelope originated due to matter outflow from an AD interior. Conclusion: Both explanations may be consequences of the super-Eddington accretion in SBS 1520+530. Using bolometric luminosity estimates available for SBS 1520+530 from the literature, we obtained a value of $\approx$ 3.4 for the Eddington ratio, which indeed indicates a moderately super-Eddington accretion regime.",
New submissions,The dynamics of background evolution and structure formation in phase space: a semi-cosmographic reconstruction,"Pankaj Chavan,Tapomoy Guha Sarkar,Anjan A Sen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature, imprinted in the transverse and radial clustering of dark matter tracers, enables the simultaneous measurement of the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at a given redshift. Further, measuring the redshift space anisotropy (RSD) allows us to measure the combination $f_8\equiv f\sigma_8(z)$. Motivated by this, we simultaneously study the dynamics of background evolution and structure formation in an abstract phase space of dynamical quantities $x=H_0 D_A/c$, $p = dx/dz$, and $f_8$. We adopt a semi-cosmographic approach, whereby we do not pre-assume any specific dark energy model to integrate the dynamical system. The Luminosity distance is expanded as a PadÃ© rational approximation in the variable $(1+z)^{1/2}$. The dynamical system is solved by using a semi-cosmographic equation of state, which incorporates the dark matter parameters along with the parameters of the PadÃ© expansion. The semi-cosmographic $D_A(z), H(z)$ and $f\sigma_8(z)$, thus obtained, are fitted with BAO and RSD data from the SDSS IV. The reconstructed phase trajectories in the $3D$ $(x,p,f_8)$ space are used to reconstruct some diagnostics of background cosmology and structure formation. At low redshifts, a discernible departure from the $\Lambda$CDM model is observed. The geometry of the phase trajectories in the projected spaces allows us to identify three key redshifts where future observations may be directed for a better understanding of cosmic tensions and anomalies.",
New submissions,A measurement of Galactic synchrotron emission using MWA drift scan observations,"Suman Chatterjee,Shouvik Sarkar,Samir Choudhuri,Khandakar Md Asif Elahi,Somnath Bharadwaj,Shiv Sethi,Akash Kumar Patwa",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Studying the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (hereafter, DGSE) at arc-minute angular scale is important to remove the foregrounds for the cosmological 21-cm observations. Statistical measurements of the large-scale DGSE can also be used to constrain the magnetic field and the cosmic ray electron density of our Galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM). Here, we have used the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations at $154.2 \, {\rm MHz}$ to measure the angular power spectrum $({\cal C}_{\ell})$ of the DGSE of a region of the sky from right ascension (RA) $349^{\circ}$ to $70.3^{\circ}$ at the fixed declination $-26.7^{\circ}$. In this RA range, we have chosen 24 pointing centers (PCs), for which we have removed all the bright point sources above $\sim430 \, {\rm mJy}\,(3\sigma)$, and applied the Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) on residual data to estimate the ${\cal C}_{\ell}$. We use the angular multipole range $65 \le \ell \le 650$ to fit the data with a model, ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}=A\times \left(\frac{1000}{\ell}\right)^{\beta}+C$, where we interpret the model as the combination of a power law $(\propto \ell^{-\beta})$ nature of the DGSE and a constant part due to the Poisson fluctuations of the residual point sources. We are able to fit the model ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}$ for six PCs centered at $\alpha=352.5^{\circ}, 353^{\circ}, 357^{\circ}, 4.5^{\circ}, 4^{\circ}$ and $1^{\circ}$. We run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler to get the best-fit values of the parameters $A, \beta$ and $C$ for these PCs. We see that the values of $A$ vary in the range $155$ to $400$ mK$^{2}$, whereas the $\beta$ varies in the range $0.9$ to $1.7$. We find that the value of $\beta$ is consistent at $2-\sigma$ level with the earlier measurement of the DGSE at similar frequency and angular scales.",
New submissions,The power of SKA to Constrain cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds below the astrophysical foreground noise,"Chengjie Fu,Jing Liu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The inspirals of supermaissive black hole binaries provide a convinced gravitational wave background in the nHz band, serving as the fiducial model of the recent gravitational wave signal reported by the PTA experiments. The uncertainties of the number of binaries contributing to each frequency bin introduce a foreground noise in the nHz and $\mu$Hz bands against the observation of the underlying gravitational wave backgrounds of the cosmological origin. In this work, we investigate a new method to constrain the cosmological gravitational wave strength under the astrophysical foreground. The energy density fluctuations from cosmological gravitational-wave sources can generally trigger the formation of compact subhalos of dark matter, and the upcoming Square Kilometer Array has the ability to constrain the abundance of the subhalos at the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ level. The cosmological gravitational wave energy spectra from various sources are expected to be constrained several orders of magnitude below the astrophysical foreground, providing more strict constraints on the parameter spaces of corresponding new physics models.",
New submissions,Gas motion in the ICM of the Virgo cluster replica,"ThÃ©o Lebeau,Stefano Ettori,Jenny G. Sorce,Nabila Aghanim,Jade Paste",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Within the deep gravitational potential of galaxy clusters lies the intracluster medium (ICM). At the first order, it is considered to be at hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well. However, evidence is growing that the ICM dynamics is non-negligible, is mostly turbulent in origin, and provides a non-thermal pressure support to the equilibrium. In this work, we intend to characterise the properties of the velocity field in the ICM of a simulated replica of the Virgo cluster. We first study the 3D and projected properties of the ICM velocity field by computing its probability density functions (PDFs) and its statistical moments. We then estimate the non-thermal pressure fraction from an effective turbulent Mach number, including the velocity dispersion. We finally compute the velocity structure function (VSF) from projected maps of the sightline velocity. We first show that the components of the 3D velocity field and the projected quantities along equivalent sightlines are anisotropic and affected by the accretion of gas from filaments. Then, we compare the mean statistical moments of the 3D velocity field to the mean properties of a hundred random projections. We show, in particular, an almost linear relation between the standard deviation estimated from direct simulation outputs and sightline velocity dispersion projections, comparable to the line broadening of X-ray atomic lines. However, this linear relation does not hold between the direct simulation outputs and the standard deviation of the sightline velocity projections, comparable to the line shift of X-ray atomic lines. We find a non-thermal pressure fraction around $6\%$ within $R_{500}$ and $9\%$ within $R_{vir}$ from sightline velocity dispersion, which is in good agreement with direct simulation outputs. Finally, we show that the VSF might probe the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback turbulent injection scale.",
New submissions,Chemical Signatures of Population III Stars in Damped Lyman-$Î±$ Absorption Systems at $z \approx 6$,"Eli Visbal,Greg L. Bryan,Zoltan Haiman",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recently, Sodini et al. (2024) presented a sample of OI damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption system (DLA) analogs at $z\sim6$ that contain possible chemical signatures of Population III (Pop III) stars. In this paper, we use an N-body simulation-based semi-analytic model of the first stars and galaxies to predict the impact of Pop III stars on high-redshift DLAs. These Pop III DLA predictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects such as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment (all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo clustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their carbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly ruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals primarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to better agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at $z\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons. First, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs with metals primarily originating from Pop III stars. Second, we find that the number of DLAs with substantial Pop III contributions depends strongly on the Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation.",

The remapping method allows for computationally efficient generation of N-body catalogs by rescaling existing simulations. In this work, we employ the remapping method to construct dark matter halo catalogs, starting from the Horizon Run 4 simulation with WMAP5 cosmology, and apply it to different target cosmologies, including WMAP7, Planck18 and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. These catalogs are then used to simulate 21 cm intensity maps. We use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) method to populate halos with neutral hydrogen (HI) and derive 21 cm brightness temperature maps. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the remapping approach in generating cosmological simulations for large-scale structure studies, offering an alternative for testing observational data pipelines and performing cosmological parameter forecasts without the need for computationally expensive full N-body simulations. We also analyze the precision and limitations of the remapping, in light of the rescaling parameters $s$ and $s_m$, as well as the effects of the halo mass and box size thresholds.",

Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.",

Specifically, we introduce a dark energy framework based on a generalised ladder-step function for the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we present two additional models in which the cosmological constant undergoes a smooth sign change at a specified redshift. We provide a detailed discussion of the construction and theoretical properties of these models, analysing their background cosmological evolution using a cosmographic approach and the statefinder hierarchy parameters. Our results are compared with those obtained for the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM models. We also perform a careful analysis of the types of singularities that may arise in these models due to a sign change in the cosmological constant. Notably, we show that a continuous sign change removes the sudden singularity present in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, replacing it with a milder $w$-singularity.",
Cross submissions,Cosmological effect of coherent oscillation of ultralight scalar fields in a multicomponent universe,"Priyanka Saha,Dipanjan Dey,Kaushik Bhattacharya",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The idea that coherent oscillations of a scalar field, oscillating over a time period that is much shorter than the cosmological timescale, can exhibit cold dark matter (CDM) like behavior was previously established. In our work we first show that this equivalence between the oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector is exact only in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in the absence of cosmological constant and any other possible matter components in the universe when the mass of the scalar field is very large compared to the Hubble parameter. Then we show how to generalize the equivalence between the coherently oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector in a spatially curved universe with multiple matter components. Using our general method, we will show how a coherently oscillating scalar field model can represent the CDM sector in the presence of non-minimal coupling of the CDM sector with radiation. Our method is powerful enough to work out the dynamics of gravitational collapse in a closed FLRW spacetime where the coherently oscillating scalar field model represents the CDM sector. We have, for the first time, presented a consistent method which specifies how a coherently oscillating scalar field model, where the scalar field is ultralight, acts like the CDM sector in a multicomponent universe.",

Low $T_{\rm rh}$ allows sizeable DM-SM interactions even for non-thermal DM allowing the latter to be probed at direct, indirect detection frontiers as well as future electron-positron and muon colliders. An extended reheating period governed by monomial inflaton potential after its slow-roll phase not only generates the required abundance of non-thermal DM via ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in but also brings the scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments across a wide range of frequencies. While particle physics experiments can probe sub-GeV scale $T_{\rm rh}$ and FIMP with mass $m_{\rm DM} \lesssim O(10)$ GeV, future GW detectors are sensitive to a much wider parameter space.",
Cross submissions,"The fast, the slow and the merging: probes of evaporating memory burdened PBHs","Alessandro Dondarini,Giulio Marino,Paolo Panci,Michael Zantedeschi",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The so-called memory-burden effect implies that evaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) inevitably stabilize before complete decay. This stabilization opens a new mass window for PBH Dark Matter below $10^{15}\,$g. The transition to the memory-burdened phase is not instantaneous but unfolds over cosmological timescales, with some PBHs entering this phase in the present epoch. Additionally, a fraction of PBHs undergo mergers today, forming ''young'' semiclassical black holes that evaporate at unsuppressed rates. Both processes generate fluxes of stable astrophysical particles, which are constrained by current measurements of high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos. Moreover, the steep increase in energy injection at higher redshifts perturbs the ionization history of the Universe, leading to complementary bounds from observations of the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. We find that the reopened window enabled by the memory-burden effect is largely within reach of detection, both locally and across cosmological distances. We further describe how our findings restrict the values of the critical exponent characterizing the memory burden phenomenon.",
Cross submissions,Dark Matter Freeze-In and Small-Scale Observables: Novel Mass Bounds and Viable Particle Candidates,"Francesco D'Eramo,Alessandro Lenoci,Ariane Dekker",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.",
Cross submissions,The AdS Perspective on the Nonlinear Tails in Black Hole Ringdown,"Alex Kehagias,Antonio Riotto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Black holes gradually settle into their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, whose amplitude diminish over time according to a power-law decay at fixed spatial locations. We show that the nonlinear tails in the presence of a quadratic source, which have been recently found to potentially dominate over the linear ones, can be simply derived from the AdS$_2$$\times$S$^2$ spacetime perspective with their amplitudes being related to the Aretakis constants.",
