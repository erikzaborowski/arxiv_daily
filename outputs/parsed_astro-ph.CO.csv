New submissions,Bose-Einstein Condensates in Astrophysics and Cosmology: From Quantum Statistics to Cosmic Structures,Nader Haddad,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and their manifestations in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved spacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme gravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and early universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating general relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we demonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star interiors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis reveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial dependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming significant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it exists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3 pc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in galactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence effects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than previously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of cosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions.",
New submissions,CIGaRS I: Combined simulation-based inference from SNae Ia and host photometry,"Konstantin Karchev,Roberto Trotta,Raul Jimenez",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and SN light, and observational selection effects.We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.",
New submissions,Euclid preparation. Establishing the quality of the 2D reconstruction of the filaments of the cosmic web with DisPerSE using Euclid photometric redshifts,Euclid Collaboration,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Cosmic filaments are prominent structures of the matter distribution of the Universe. Modern detection algorithms are an efficient way to identify filaments in large-scale observational surveys of galaxies. Many of these methods were originally designed to work with simulations and/or well-sampled spectroscopic surveys. When spectroscopic redshifts are not available, the filaments of the cosmic web can be detected in projection using photometric redshifts in slices along the Line of Sight, which enable the exploration of larger cosmic volumes. However, this comes at the expense of a lower redshift precision. It is therefore crucial to assess the differences between filaments extracted from exact redshifts and from photometric redshifts for a specific survey. We apply this analysis to capture the uncertainties and biases of filament extractions introduced by using the photometric sample of the Euclid Wide Survey. The question that we address in this work is how can we compare two filament samples derived with redshifts of different precisions in the Euclid Wide Survey context. We apply the cosmic web detection algorithm DisPerSE, in the redshift range $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.5$, to the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) simulated galaxy sample which reproduces several characteristics of the Euclid Wide Survey. We develop a method to compare skeletons derived from photometric redshifts to those derived from true galaxy positions. This method expands the commonly used measure of distance between filaments to include geometrical (angles between filaments) and astrophysical considerations (galaxy mass gradients and connectivity-mass relations). We assess whether this approach strengthens our ability to correctly identify filaments in very large surveys such as the Euclid Wide Survey. [abridged]",
New submissions,Reheating study of Mexican-Hat-type Potentials,"Sudhava Yadav,Akash Yadav,K.K. Venkataratnam",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study reheating in Mexican Hat type potentials, emphasizing the role of the post-inflationary equation-of-state parameter($\overline{\omega }_{\text{re}}$) in shaping observable predictions. By exploring the allowed range of $\overline{\omega }_{\text{re}}$, we derive reheating temperature, e-fold counts, and inflationary observables, showing that the conventional Mexican Hat model satisfies Planck18+BK18+BAO constraints on $n_s$ and r. The analysis underscores reheating as a critical link between theoretical potentials and CMB data. In addition, the holographic Mexican Hat realization is examined as a benchmark, with our results mapping its phenomenological boundaries. This work illustrates how reheating studies sharpen constraints and guide refinements of unified inflationary scenarios.",
New submissions,Exploring HI Galaxy Redshift Survey Strategies for the FAST Core Array Interferometry,"Zhenglong Li,Diyang Liu,Chengliang Xu,Yichao Li,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore the feasibility of HI galaxy redshift surveys with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) and its proposed Core Array interferometry. Using semi-analytical simulations, we compare the performance of the FAST single-dish and Core Array modes in drift scan (DS) and on-the-fly (OTF) observations across different redshifts. Our results show that the FAST single-dish mode enables significant HI detections at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.35$) but is limited at higher redshifts due to shot noise. The Core Array interferometry, with higher sensitivity and angular resolution, provides robust HI galaxy detections up to $z \sim 1$, maintaining a sufficient number density for power spectrum measurements and BAO constraints. At low redshifts ($z \sim 0.01$ -- $0.08$), both configurations perform well, though cosmic variance dominates uncertainties. At higher redshifts ($z > 0.35$), the Core Array outperforms the single-dish mode, while increasing the survey area has little impact on single-dish observations due to shot noise limitations. The DS mode efficiently covers large sky areas but is constrained by Earth's rotation, whereas the OTF mode allows more flexible deep-field surveys at the cost of operational overhead. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing survey strategies to maximize FAST's potential for HI cosmology. The Core Array is particularly well-suited for high-redshift HI galaxy surveys, enabling precise constraints on large-scale structure and dark energy.",
New submissions,Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in a Second-Order CPL Dark Energy Model,"Shubham Barua,Shantanu Desai",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Recent DESI results indicate a strong preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) when baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We analyze the exponential (EXP) parameterization, which introduces a second-order correction to CPL. We determine and compare the 95% upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses for three dark energy (DE) models -- $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and EXP -- across four neutrino mass hierarchies (1 massive/2 massless, degenerate, normal, inverted) and multiple dataset combinations (CMB$+$BAO, CMB$+$BAO$+$PantheonPlus, CMB$+$BAO$+$DESY5), employing both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks with physical lower limits from oscillation experiments (0.059 eV and 0.11 eV). Our results show that CPL yields tighter ($\lesssim10$%) bounds compared to EXP. We further confirm earlier findings that neutrino mass constraints are only mildly sensitive to the assumed hierarchy and that the frequentist bounds are tighter than Bayesian ones. Furthermore, the imposed oscillation lower limits, the datasets used and the cosmological model play a crucial role in the inferred cosmological neutrino mass bounds. For the datasets, hierarchies, and DE parameterizations considered, we find no statistically significant evidence for nonzero neutrino mass consistent with oscillation lower limits.",
New submissions,Simulation based inference of the ionization history from the 2D 21 cm power spectrum,"Nadia Cooper,Carina Norregaard,Romain Meriot,Jonathan R. Pritchard",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The 21 cm signal contains a wealth of information about the formation of the first stars and the reionization of the intergalactic medium during the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The timing of these important milestones has only roughly been constrained through indirect measurements, such as from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) optical depth, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Therefore, inferring the neutral fraction over cosmic time is a goal of upcoming 21 cm experiments, such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). We contrast two approaches to infer astrophysical parameters and ionization history from 21 cm 2D power spectra (2DPS). We develop an emulator of the 21 cm 2DPS, trained on 21cmFAST simulations, taking into account the expected instrumental noise from the SKA and sample variance. We then perform simulation based inference (SBI) using neural posterior estimation (NPE). We compare training on datasets of noisy 2DPS obtained from 21cmFAST simulations and an emulator, to infer astrophysical parameters of interest. Using an emulator of the ionization history, which has been trained on simulations from the same astrophysical parameters, we then obtain posterior distributions of the ionization history over the redshift range z $\sim$ 5-12. We demonstrate that both methods are capable of accurately recovering the ionization history and astrophysical parameters. However, coverage tests indicate that adding emulated samples does not improve predictions. This work suggests that due to the stochastic nature of the 2DPS, using an emulator of this summary statistic may result in poorer inference.",
New submissions,What do we mean by stellar mass? The impact of the pre-main sequence on the mass to light ratio of young and intermediate age stellar populations,"Elizabeth R. Stanway,Conor M. Byrne,Ankur Upadhyaya(University of Warwick, UK)",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"Stellar population synthesis models are an essential tool with which galaxy physical parameters are extracted from observations. However they are built on assumptions designed for use in the local Universe, and not always appropriate to high redshift galaxies. Here we consider the impact of including the hitherto-neglected stellar pre-main sequence delay timescale on the interpretation of composite stellar populations at ages of <1 Gyr. We find that doing so has an impact on the optical luminosity of very young stellar populations of up to ~10 per cent, although smaller changes in observed light (<5 per cent) are expected in most use cases. However the impact on the inferred stellar mass and mass-to-light ratios is significant (a factor of 2 or more), depending on how those properties are defined. We find that the short time scales for star formation in the distant Universe require a clearer definition for the stellar mass in a population, and will impact assumptions about the inferred shape of the stellar initial mass function from observations.",
New submissions,LiteBIRD Science Goals and Forecasts. $E$-mode Anomalies,"A. J. Banday,C. Gimeno-Amo,P. Diego-Palazuelos,E. de la Hoz,A. Gruppuso,N. Raffuzzi,E. Martínez-González,P. Vielva,R. B.

Vacher,B. van Tent",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Various so-called anomalies have been found in both the WMAP and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature data that exert a mild tension against the highly successful best-fit 6 parameter cosmological model, potentially providing hints of new physics to be explored. That these are real features on the sky is uncontested. However, given their modest significance, whether they are indicative of true departures from the standard cosmology or simply statistical excursions, due to a mildly unusual configuration of temperature anisotropies on the sky which we refer to as the ""fluke hypothesis"", cannot be addressed further without new information.No theoretical model of primordial perturbations has to date been constructed that can explain all of the temperature anomalies. Therefore, we focus in this paper on testing the fluke hypothesis, based on the partial correlation between the temperature and $E$-mode CMB polarisation signal. In particular, we compare the properties of specific statistics in polarisation, built from unconstrained realisations of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model as might be observed by the LiteBIRD satellite, with those determined from constrained simulations, where the part of the $E$-mode anisotropy correlated with temperature is constrained by observations of the latter. Specifically, we use inpainted Planck 2018 SMICA temperature data to constrain the $E$-mode realisations. Subsequent analysis makes use of masks defined to minimise the impact of the inpainting procedure on the $E$-mode map statistics.We find that statistical assessments of the $E$-mode data alone do not provide any evidence for or against the fluke hypothesis. However, tests based on cross-statistical measures determined from temperature and $E$ modes can allow this hypothesis to be rejected with a moderate level of probability.",
New submissions,Ultralight dark matter from non-slowroll inflation,"Martina La Rosa,Gianmassimo Tasinato",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The longitudinal mode of a massive vector field, generated during inflation, offers a well-motivated and phenomenologically rich candidate for dark matter. We show that a rapid variation in the mass of the vector boson, occurring during a brief phase of non-slowroll inflationary evolution, can naturally give rise to extremely small vector masses after inflation ends, corresponding to an ultralight dark matter candidate. This mechanism predicts a stochastic gravitational-wave background, generated at second order by non-adiabatic longitudinal vector fluctuations and amplified at very low frequencies, yielding a distinctive observational signature of the scenario. By leveraging a brief departure from slowroll dynamics during inflation - commonly invoked in scenarios that produce primordial black holes - our framework establishes a novel connection between ultralight vector dark matter and primordial black hole physics, suggesting a possible unified setting for mixed dark matter scenarios.",

Sosa Fiscella",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present the first catalog of targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift, and CW frequency, our strain and chirp mass upper limits are on average 2.6$\times$ more constraining than sky-averaged limits. Bayesian model comparisons against a common uncorrelated red noise for the gravitational wave background (GWB) disfavor a CW signal for almost all targets, yielding a mean Bayes factor of $0.87 \pm 0.31$. There are two notable exceptions: SDSS J153636.22+044127.0, ``Rohan'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 3.37(5)$, and SDSS J072908.71+400836.6, ``Gondor'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 2.44(3)$. These Bayes factors correspond to p-values of $0.01$--$0.03$ ($1.9\sigma$--$2.3\sigma$) and $0.05$--$0.08$ ($1.4\sigma$--$1.6\sigma$), respectively, depending on the empirical null distribution. We outline the beginnings of a detection protocol by identifying and carrying out a battery of tests on Rohan and Gondor to verify their binary nature. Notably, when replacing the common uncorrelated red noise model with a Hellings--Downs correlated GWB, Rohan's Bayes factor drops to $1.25(7)$, while Gondor's increases to $3.2(1)$. Both have rich electromagnetic datasets, including optical and infrared variability and spectroscopic features that support their classification as SMBHB candidates, though this was discovered after the targeted searches were complete. Our results suggest more simulations are needed to confirm or refute the nature of these and future SMBHB candidates, while creating a roadmap for targeted CW detection.",
New submissions,Probing Reheating in a Decaying Oscillatory Inflationary Model with Latest ACT Constraints,"Li-Yang Chen,Rongrong Zha,Feng-Yi Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate a moderate upward shift in the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to Planck $2018$, thereby placing tighter constraints on inflationary scenarios. Motivated by these results, we investigate a decaying oscillatory Inflationary model inspired by minimal no-scale supergravity, characterized by the potential $V(\phi) = \lambda \phi^{2n} \sin^2(l/\phi^n)$. We perform a numerical analysis of the background dynamics and reheating process across a range of model parameters. The model yields robust predictions for $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in excellent agreement with current ACT data. Successful reheating in this model requires a large effective equation-of-state parameter approaching unity, consistent with both cosmic microwave background (CMB) and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints. The corresponding number of inflationary $e$-folds increases with $n$ and is weakly sensitive to $l$. Overall, the model offers a simple yet predictive framework that captures both inflationary dynamics and post-inflationary reheating, and remains viable under the latest high-precision observations.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Waves and Cosmological Observables from First-Order Phase Transitions: Thermal Corrections at Low Temperature,"Katharena Christy,James B. Dent,Sumit Ghosh,Jason Kumar,J. O'Thello Ward",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We consider the impact on cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) of low-temperature thermal corrections to the effective potential. These are corrections from degrees of freedom whose field-dependent masses are much smaller than the nucleation temperature in the true vacuum, though they may be much larger than the nucleation temperature in the false vacuum. Although the general form of these corrections to the thermal effective potential can be quite complicated, we argue that the net effect of all such corrections can be well-modeled with a single new parameter. We determine the shift in the parameters of the FOPT in terms of this new parameter, and the impact on gravitational wave signals and cosmological observables.",
