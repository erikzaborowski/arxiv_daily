Vedantham,Fatima Yousuf,Philippe Zarka",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"LuSEE-Night is a pathfinder radio telescope on the lunar far side employing four 3-m monopole antennas arranged as two horizontal cross pseudo-dipoles on a rotational stage and sensitive to the radio sky in the 1-50 MHz frequency band. LuSEE-Night measures the corresponding 16 correlation products as a function of frequency. While each antenna combination measures radiation coming from a large area of the sky, their aggregate information as a function of phase in the lunar cycle and rotational stage position can be deconvolved into a low-resolution map of the sky. We study this deconvolution using linear map-making based on the Wiener filter algorithm. We illustrate how systematic effects can be effectively marginalised over as contributions to the noise covariance and demonstrate this technique on beam knowledge uncertainty and gain fluctuations. With reasonable assumptions about instrument performance, we show that LuSEE-Night should be able to map the sub-50 MHz sky at a ~5-degree resolution.",
New submissions,Score Matching on Large Geometric Graphs for Cosmology Generation,"Diana-Alexandra Onutu,Yue Zhao,Joaquin Vanschoren,Vlado Menkovski",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Generative models are a promising tool to produce cosmological simulations but face significant challenges in scalability, physical consistency, and adherence to domain symmetries, limiting their utility as alternatives to $N$-body simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000 halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the universe.",
New submissions,Disformal interactions in the Dark Sector: From driving Early Dark Energy to confronting cosmological tensions,"Pulkit Bansal(IIT Bombay),Joseph P. Johnson(IISER Mohali),S. Shankaranarayanan(IIT Bombay)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The $\Lambda$CDM model faces significant challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the dark sector and persistent tensions in the Hubble constant and the clustering amplitude. To address these issues, we propose a general disformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a field-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions including conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early Dark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble friction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological constant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and eventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark energy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on finely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a consequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter, offering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions. This framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature spectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for the observed low-$\ell$ anomaly. By deriving these effects from a fundamental action, our work provides a unified, testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that can be constrained by next-generation cosmological surveys and gravitational wave observations.",
New submissions,High-$z$ SMBHs in Cosmological Models with Enhanced Power Spectra,"M.V. Tkachev,S.V. Pilipenko,E.V. Mikheeva,V.N. Lukash",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We consider the impact of non-power-law spectra of matter perturbations with a bump or with a blue tilt at small scales on the evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located the innermost part of galaxies. We study SMBH's mass growth rate and the epochs of their birth in four cosmological models using N-body simulations of dark matter within the box of $(100$~Mpc$/h)^3$. The simulations were populated with SMBHs using TRINITY semi-analytic model. We found that the most massive SMBHs at the redshifts $z=5-6$ are similar in all considered cosmologies, including the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. At larger $z$ the bumpy spectra can provide a tenfold increase (relative to $\Lambda$CDM model) in the masses of individual black holes without requiring super-Eddington accretion or heavy seeds. The nucleation of SMBHs starts at $z\sim 13$, which is earlier than in the standard $\Lambda$CMD model.",
New submissions,RedMaPPer Cluster Properties from Two-Dimensional Lensing Shear Maps in the HSC-SSP Survey,"Chenxu Cui,Xiangkun Liu,Huanyuan Shan,Ziwei Li,Zuhui Fan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Dark matter halos are fundamental cosmological structures whose properties-such as concentration, ellipticity, and mass centroid-encode information about their formation and evolution. Concentration traces collapse time and internal structure, while ellipticity and centroid offsets reflect halo shape and dynamical state. Accurate characterization of these properties improves mass estimates and tests dark matter models. Gravitational lensing, which directly probes projected mass distributions, provides a powerful means to constrain halo structure. We present a 2D weak-lensing analysis of 299 RedMaPPer clusters using shear measurements from the HSC-SSP first-year data release. By fitting elliptical NFW models with mass priors from the RedMaPPer cluster richness-mass relation, considering the priors helps us break the mass-concentration degeneracy and tighten constraints on other parameters. The derived concentration-mass relation exhibits a slightly steeper slope than traditional weak-lensing power-law or upturn models, and agrees more closely with the results from strong lensing selected halos. More massive and lower-redshift clusters tend to have lower concentrations and appear more spherical. The halo ellipticity distribution is characterized by e=1-b/a=0.530+/-0.168, with a mean of <e>=0.505+/-0.007. We also detect a bimodal distribution in the offsets between optical centers and mass centroids: some halos are well-aligned with their brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), while others show significant displacements. These results highlight the power of 2D weak-lensing modeling in probing halo morphology and in providing key inputs for understanding and modeling systematic effects in stacked lensing analyses.",
New submissions,Dual axion-like field inflation,"Runchao Huang,Ruifeng Zheng,Qiaoli Yang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Cosmic inflation is one of the most important paradigms in modern cosmology. In its simplest form, inflation is driven by a single inflaton field. However, multi-field inflation has become increasingly attractive because it can solve many theoretical and observational challenges. In this paper, we propose a particular model involving two axion-like fields with simply monodromy-dominated potentials. We demonstrate that this model is consistent with current cosmological observations.",
New submissions,Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories,Shinji Tsujikawa,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} > -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without introducing theoretical pathologies. In Horndeski theories, however, breaking the shift symmetry allows this transition. We present an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a higher-order derivative term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts while avoiding ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.",
New submissions,Quantum-Corrected $ϕ^{4}$ Inflation in Light of ACT Observations,"Jureeporn Yuennan,Peeravit Koad,Farruh Atamurotov,Phongpichit Channuie",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with Planck and DESI data, suggest a scalar spectral index $n_s$ higher than the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby placing conventional attractor-type inflationary models such as Starobinsky $R^2$ and Higgs inflation under increasing tension at the $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ level. In this work, we examine quantum-corrected $\phi^4$ inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Introducing an anomalous scaling parameter $\gamma$ to capture quantum corrections to the effective potential, we derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$. Confronting these predictions with ACT, Planck, and BAO+lensing constraints, we demonstrate that modest values of $\gamma$ can raise $n_s$ into the ACT-preferred range while maintaining a strongly suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio. For instance, with $N=60$ and $\gamma\simeq 0.006$, the model predicts $n_s\simeq 0.974$ and $r\simeq 0.007$, in excellent agreement with current bounds. We further investigate preheating dynamics, focusing on particle production via parametric resonance in quantum-corrected $\phi^4$ inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In this scenario, the inflaton $\phi$ couples to an additional scalar $\chi$ through an interaction $g^{2}\phi^{2}\chi^{2}$. In Minkowski spacetime, the resonance dynamics reduce to the Mathieu equation, and we find that broad resonance can be readily achieved, leading to efficient particle production.",
New submissions,"A Unified Lagrangian Framework for Galaxy Clustering: Consistent Modeling of Bias, Redshift-Space Distortions, and Reconstruction",Naonori Sugiyama,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present \emph{Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory} (ULPT), a perturbative framework for consistently modeling galaxy density fluctuations across real space, redshift space, and post-reconstruction fields. Unlike existing approaches that treat these cases separately, ULPT provides a single theoretical structure that incorporates the three essential coordinate mappings: the Lagrangian-to-Eulerian transformation, the real-to-redshift mapping induced by peculiar velocities, and the remapping from pre to post reconstruction. A key feature of our formulation is the explicit decomposition of the density field into two physically distinct components: the \emph{Jacobian deviation}, which encodes intrinsic linear and nonlinear growth, and the \emph{displacement-mapping effect}, which captures large-scale convective distortions. This separation enables a fully analytic and infrared (IR)-safe resummation, ensuring exact IR cancellation, a consistent Gaussian description of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping, and the correct residual structure in cross spectra between fields with distinct IR behavior. The perturbative expansion of ULPT naturally generates Galileon-type operators, thereby providing a compact and physically motivated operator basis for nonlinear and nonlocal Lagrangian bias, and allowing for a renormalization-free treatment of biased tracers. Within this framework, we derive a unified expression for the power spectrum that applies equally to dark matter, biased tracers, redshift-space distortions, and reconstructed fields. ULPT thus offers a robust and extensible foundation for precision modeling of large-scale structure, with potential extensions to higher-order statistics, such as the bispectrum, and to other two-point observables, such as galaxy--galaxy lensing.",
New submissions,"XMAGNET : Kinetic, Thermal and Magnetic AGN Feedback in Massive Galaxies at Halo Masses $\sim 10^{13.5}$ M$_\odot$","Deovrat Prasad,Philipp Grete,Brian O'Shea,Forrest Glines,Mark Voit,Freeke van de Voort,Martin Fournier,Benjamin Wibking",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The interplay between radiative cooling of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and feedback heating governs the evolution of the universe's most massive galaxies. This paper presents simulations of feedback processes in massive galaxies showing how kinetic, thermal, and magnetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback interacts with the CGM under different environmental conditions. We find that in massive galaxies with shallower central gravitational potential and higher CGM pressure (multiphase galaxy; MPG) pure kinetic AGN feedback is most efficient in preventing CGM cooling from becoming catastrophic while maintaining the CGM entropy within the observed range. For the same galaxy, partitioning AGN energy injection into kinetic ($75\%$) and thermal ($25\%$) energy results in an entropy bump within $r\lesssim15$ kpc while also having a larger amount of cold gas extending out to $r\sim80$ kpc. A magnetohydrodynamic MPG run with seed magnetic field in the CGM (1~$\mu$G) and partial magnetised AGN feedback ($1\%$ of total AGN power) also shows a higher entropy (within $r<15$ kpc) and cold gas mass, albeit the cold gas remains constrained within $r\lesssim30$ kpc. For a similarly massive galaxy with deeper potential well and low CGM pressure (single phase galaxy; SPG) our simulations show that for both hydro and MHD runs with partial thermal AGN energy, the feedback mechanism remains tightly self-regulating with centrally concentrated cooling (within $r<1$ kpc). Our simulations of a similar mass galaxy with a deeper potential well and higher CGM pressure (SPG-Cool) show that our AGN feedback mechanism cannot get rid of the high CGM density and pressure and its long term evolution is similar to the multiphase galaxy.",
New submissions,Calculating the power spectrum in stochastic inflation by Monte Carlo simulation and least squares curve fitting,"Koichi Miyamoto,Yuichiro Tada",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The stochastic-$\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.",
New submissions,Constraining deviations from $Λ$CDM in the Hubble expansion rate,Yupeng Yang,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"(abridged)We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario. The specific form of this model is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\rm \Lambda CDM}(\Omega_m, z)[1+\delta(z)]$. We consider three forms of $\delta(z)$: model I, $\delta(z)=\delta_c$; model II, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and model III, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}{\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\delta_c$ represents a constant value. To constrain the models, we utilize a comprehensive set of observational data, including DESI BAO, CMB, CC, SNIa data, and the $H_0$ measured by the SH0ES. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\delta_c$ tends to take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive values in model III. Our analysis further discloses that for model I, in which the deviation parameter is redshift-independent, there is a notable 2$\sigma$ deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when considering the combined datasets of DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES. However, this deviation decreases to less than $2\sigma$ once SNIa datasets are included. In contrast, model II remains consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. Model III exhibits a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding $2\sigma$ and reaching $3\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The Akaike Information Criterion indicates that models I and II are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model being substantially disfavored for the combined datasets DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES+DESY5. These results suggest that the Hubble expansion rate likely deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction-a conclusion that aligns with various studies on dark energy, wherein dynamic dark energy is often favored over a cosmological constant.",
New submissions,Dark Degeneracy in DESI DR2: Interacting or Evolving Dark Energy?,"Vitor Petri,Valerio Marra,Rodrigo von Marttens",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, despite its success, is challenged by persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($S_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide significantly better fits to the data than $\Lambda$CDM. Although indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark sector interaction at $z \approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially alleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \lesssim 0.8$, which is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.",
New submissions,Investigating Optical and Ring-Down Gravitational Wave Properties of a Rotating Black Hole in a Dehnen Galactic Dark Matter Halo,"Mrinnoy M. Gohain,Dhruba Jyoti Gogoi,Kalyan Bhuyan,Prabwal Phukon",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a comprehensive study of the optical and dynamical properties of a rotating black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,0)$ galactic dark matter halo, modeled by a double power-law density profile commonly used to describe realistic galactic cores. By extending our previous Schwarzschild-Dehnen solution using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct a Kerr-like axisymmetric spacetime that smoothly incorporates both black hole rotation and the influence of the surrounding dark matter halo. We systematically investigate the effects of the halo parameters-the central density and halo radius-on horizon structure, the shape and extent of the ergoregion, and the null geodesics associated with black hole shadows. Our results show that the presence of a dense or extended halo expands the event horizon and ergoregion, and significantly alters the size and distortion of the black hole shadow. Furthermore, by applying the WKB approximation to scalar field perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and demonstrate that the frequencies and damping times of ringdown signals are highly sensitive to the halo profile. These results open promising avenues for probing the dark matter environment of astrophysical black holes through black hole imaging and gravitational wave observations.",
New submissions,Timing Mass of the Local Group,Louis E. Strigari,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The classic model of the Local Group (LG) is that of two dominant constituents, the Milky Way and M31, first separating and then detaching from the Hubble flow, leading to a nearly radial approaching orbit. This simple model has been confronted by new measurements of the 3D M31 kinematics, by cosmological simulations, and by theoretical understanding of the impact of massive substructures such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. This article explores the consequences of new observations and theory on the determination of the mass and dynamics of the LG. The M31 tangential velocity measurement and contribution from the cosmological constant both increase the implied timing mass of the LG to be $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. Timing mass estimates for the LG tend to be larger than the sum of the Milky Way and M31 halo masses, and larger than independent LG mass estimators. Precision future kinematics have the potential to explore the origin of this difference, shed light on dark matter in the LG, the origin of its angular momentum, and possibly even local values of cosmological parameters.",
New submissions,Addressing Dipole Tension via Clustering in $Λ$CDM and beyond,"Arefeh Daei Rasouli,Haniyeh S. Tadayyoni,Shant Baghram,Sohrab Rahvar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The dipole in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is typically attributed to the Doppler effect and our motion relative to the CMB rest frame. It is expected that observations of large-scale structures would also exhibit a related kinematic dipole, helping to confirm the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole. However, numerous studies of the large-scale structure dipole have shown significant discrepancies with predictions based on the CMB. In this work, we investigate how considering the clustering dipole affects the cosmic large-scale structure distribution dipole using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS) and examine the nonlinear regime to calculate the correlation between the clustering dipole and the kinematic dipole. We also determine whether these outcomes help reconcile previous measurements of the NVSS dipole with predictions based on the CMB. Additionally, we explore a model in which the distribution of matter on large scales might be intrinsically anisotropic. Using the remnant discrepancy between the observed and predicted dipole, we derive an upper limit for the amplitude of intrinsic anisotropy and calculate the clustering for this model. Furthermore, we investigate these results within the framework of modified gravity theories, specifically the $f(R)$ gravity model. By examining this model, it is possible to gain a better understanding of how the cosmic dark energy component affects the dipole. Finally, by comparing these two models, we can see that the $f(R)$ model predicts a higher clustering dipole compared to the standard cosmological model, which explains the discrepancy between the kinetic and clustering dipoles and leads to a higher dipole amplitude.",
Cross submissions,Big Bang as spacetime defect,F.R. Klinkhamer,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We review the suggestion that it is possible to eliminate the Big Bang curvature singularity of the Friedmann cosmological solution by considering a particular type of degenerate spacetime metric. Specifically, we take the 4-dimensional spacetime metric to have a spacelike 3-dimensional defect with a vanishing determinant of the metric. This new solution suggests the existence of another ""side"" of the Big Bang (perhaps a more appropriate description than ""pre-Big-Bang"" phase used in our original paper). The corresponding new solution for defect wormholes is also briefly discussed.",
Cross submissions,Quantum Corrections to Symmetron Fifth-Force Profiles,"Michael Udemba,Peter Millington",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Nonlinear scalar-tensor theories of gravity have been considered as candidates for dark matter and dark energy. Often, they possess screening mechanisms which allow the fifth force mediated by the additional scalar degree(s) of freedom to evade detection from local experiments. Their classical behaviour is well studied, but their quantum nature is relatively unexplored. We outline a Green's function method for obtaining the leading-order quantum corrections to the classical symmetron field profile in the vicinity of a spherically symmetric extended source. For parameters that experiments had previously ruled out, our calculations indicate that the symmetron force may be weaker than the classical field suggests.",
Cross submissions,Testing the Dark Universe through the Layzer-Irvine Equation,Cláudio Gomes,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We review the cosmic generalisation of the virial theorem known as the Layzer-Irvine equation, also independently derived by Dmitriev and Zeldovich.

We discuss results from the previous scenarios and point out future directions.",
Cross submissions,Confronting Rainbow-deformed $f(R)$ Gravity with the ACT Data,"S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we examine a theoretical scenario which combines two fundamental theoretical proposals for the early Universe and a possible evolution for the early post-inflationary epoch. Specifically, we assume that the early Universe contains gravity's rainbow effects on the spacetime and the inflationary Lagrangian contains $R^2$ corrections or $f(R)$ gravity corrections in general. In addition we assume that the era beyond the end of inflation until the reheating temperature is reached, is a kination era. Both theories, $R^2$ and gravity's rainbow emerge from a quantum context so their effects should be first checked at the theory which connects the quantum with the classical, hence inflation. Spacetime is four dimensional and the effects of the quantum theory could possibly be imprinted in the inflationary Lagrangian and of course on the spacetime itself. For the gravity's rainbow deformed Starobinsky model, both Lagrangian quantum effects and spacetime quantum effects are combined. As we show the resulting theory is compatible with the ACT data. We also consider power-law $f(R)$ gravity deformations and we show that in this case, the model is viable without the need of extending the slow-roll era of inflation.",
Cross submissions,Strong Gravity Effects on $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected Single Scalar Field Inflation and Compatibility with the ACT Data,V.K. Oikonomou,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we introduce the rescaled $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected minimally coupled scalar field theory, a theory that contains minimal quantum corrections of the single scalar field Lagrangian. We develop the theoretical framework in the string frame where the baryons geodesics are free fall geodesics and we do not treat the theory as a two scalar field theory in the Einstein frame. The theoretical framework can be reduced to a single scalar field theory framework by using a perturbative expansion at the level of the field equations, making the resulting theory easy to tackle analytically. The first two quantum corrections contain two terms, a linear $\sim \mathcal{R}$ and a quadratic term $\sim \mathcal{R}^2$. The effect of the linear term alters the Einstein-Hilbert term, making the resulting theory a rescaled version of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Due to the presence of the rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term $\sim \lambda \frac{\mathcal{R}}{16\pi G}$, the gravitational constant will no longer be that of Newton's, but a rescaled one $\frac{G}{\lambda}$ and hence gravity can be stronger primordially, or even weaker. The perspective of having stronger gravity primordially, is compatible with intuition, since one expects a stronger gravity primordially, but having a weaker gravity for some reason is not prohibited theoretically. The attribute of our theoretical framework is that it allows a stronger gravity primordially, which returns to ordinary gravity as the curvature of the Universe decreases. We examine the effects of the quantum terms on several mainstream scalar field inflationary potentials, such as hybrid inflation, monomial inflation and power-law inflation.",
Cross submissions,Probing Leptophobic Dark Sectors via Gravitational Wave Signatures,"Taramati,Lekhika Malhotra,Zafri A. Borboruah,Sudhanwa Patra",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study a minimally extended version of the Standard Model where baryon number is gauged with a $U(1)_B$ symmetry. This model can be made anomaly-free by adding a set of additional fermions. The lightest component of these fermions behaves as a viable dark matter candidate. We show that the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$ symmetry can produce gravitational waves via bubble dynamics resulting from a first-order phase transition, which can be detected in future gravitational wave experiments like LISA and ET. Such gravitational wave signatures can be used as a probe to constrain the model in future observations and complement dark matter and collider searches. We perform a random numerical scan of the parameter space and derive the viable region consistent with current bounds from dark matter experiments such as LUX-ZEPLIN and XENONnT and sensitive to future gravitational wave experiments. We find that dark matter with mass of order $\mathcal{O}(1 - 10)$ TeV is the most interesting to test in future gravitational wave as well as laboratory experiments. In the viable parameter space, the mass of the $Z'$ gauge boson associated with the $U(1)_B$ lies in the few-tens of TeV region, and the mass of the scalar associated with the symmetry breaking lies around a few hundred GeV to TeV scale. Hence, the dark matter and mediator mass scales typically fall beyond the reach of present direct detection experiments and are marginally accessible at current collider energies.",
Cross submissions,Weak Lensing Approximation of Wave-optics Effects from General Symmetric Lens Profiles,"Zhao-Feng Wu,Otto A. Hannuksela,Martin Hendry,Quynh Lan Nguyen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational lensing of electromagnetic (EM) waves has yielded many profound discoveries across fundamental physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics (WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform. These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits. Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic content, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter.",
