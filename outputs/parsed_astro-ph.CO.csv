New submissions,Discovery of Diffuse Radio Emission in a Massive z=1.709 Cool Core Cluster: A Candidate Radio Mini-Halo,"Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo,Roland Timmerman,Christoph Pfrommer,Erik Osinga,Larissa Tevlin,Tracy M. A. Webb,Natalia Martorella,Xiaoyuan Zhang,Reinout van Weeren,Hyunseop Choi,Gabriella Di Gennaro,Marie-Lou Gendron-Marsolais,Carter Rhea",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Clusters of galaxies host spectacular diffuse radio sources, extending over scales from 100 kpc to several Mpcs. These sources, with extremely faint surface brightness ($\mu$Jy/arcsec$^2$ level), are not tied to individual galaxies but trace synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic fields and relativistic particles within the intracluster environment. Here, we report the discovery of a candidate radio mini-halo in SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, the most distant cool-core galaxy cluster identified to date at $z=1.709$, using deep LOFAR 120-168 MHz observations. We show that this emission originates from diffuse cluster-associated processes rather than unresolved AGN or star-forming galaxies. The diffuse radio emission coincides spatially with the X-ray emission of the hot intracluster medium and has a radio power of $P_{\rm 150~MHz}=49.8^{+14.7}_{-11.7} \times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, exhibiting striking similarities to low-redshift radio mini-halos. This discovery doubles the redshift of previously known mini-halos, challenging models of inverse Compton losses and indicating the presence of strong magnetic fields, enhanced turbulence in high-redshift clusters, or active hadronic processes that require a cosmic ray-to-thermal energy ratio of 0.07 within 200 kpc, assuming a clumped distribution with spatial correlations among the gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic field that partially compensate for cosmological redshift dimming. It further implies that magnetic fields are efficiently amplified to $\sim$$10~\mu$G levels within a Mpc$^3$ volume during the epoch of cluster formation before $z\sim2$. These findings provide critical insights into high-redshift cluster physics and emphasize the transformative potential of next-generation radio surveys, such as those with the SKA and ngVLA, in exploring the early evolution of galaxy clusters.",
New submissions,Bayesian Posteriors with Stellar Population Synthesis on GPUs,"Georgios Zacharegkas,Andrew Hearin,Andrew Benson",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Models of Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) provide a predictive framework for the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy. SPS predictions can be computationally intensive, creating a bottleneck for attempts to infer the physical properties of large populations of individual galaxies from their SEDs and photometry; these computational challenges are especially daunting for near-future cosmology surveys that will measure the photometry of billions of galaxies. In this paper, we explore a range of computational techniques aimed at accelerating SPS predictions of galaxy photometry using the JAX library to target GPUs. We study a particularly advantageous approximation to the calculation of galaxy photometry that speeds up the computation by a factor of 50 relative to the exact calculation. We introduce a novel technique for incorporating burstiness into models of galaxy star formation history that captures very short-timescale fluctuations with negligible increase in computation time. We study the performance of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms in which individual chains are parallelized across independent GPU threads, finding that our pipeline can carry out Bayesian inference at a rate of approximately $1,000$ galaxy posteriors per GPU-minute. Our results provide an update to standard benchmarks in the literature on the computational demands of SPS inference; our publicly available code enables previously-impractical Bayesian analyses of large galaxy samples, and includes several standalone modules that could be adopted to speedup existing SPS pipelines.",
New submissions,Direct reconstruction of the Reionization history from 21cm 2D Power Spectra,"Yannic Pietschke,Caroline Heneka,Tom Schlenker,Ayodele Ore,Benedikt Schosser","Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)","The 21cm line from the spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen (HI) provides a unique window into the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the final phase transition of our Universe. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) enables precise measurements of 21cm fluctuations that trace ionization, temperature, and density fluctuations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Nevertheless, a direct reconstruction of the timeline of the EoR in terms of the progress of ionization remains an ongoing challenge due to the highly non-Gaussian nature and thus intractable likelihood of the 21cm signal. Here, we present EoRFlow, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for reconstructing the global neutral hydrogen fraction $x_{\mathrm{HI}}(z)$ directly from 2D cylindrically averaged power spectra (2DPS) of the 21cm signal. We validate our method on realistic mock datasets for SKA-Low. Bypassing the need for explicit likelihood formulations, our approach enables fast, unbiased posterior estimation of the $x_{\mathrm{HI}}$ evolution in narrow redshift slices, allowing for piecewise reconstruction of the global reionization history. By directly inferring the reionization history from 21cm power spectra, our framework provides a scalable and robust path forward for 21cm cosmology in the SKA era.",
New submissions,New bounds on Axion-Like Particles in the Ultraviolet from Legacy Data,Elisa Todarello,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We use legacy data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to search for a spectral line from the spontaneous decay of axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter. The HST data consists of blank sky observations taken with the Faint Object Spectrograph in the 165-240~nm wavelength range, while the IUE data consists of observations of the Virgo Cluster obtained with the long- and short-wavelength spectrographs, covering 195-325~nm and 123-200~nm, respectively. We set a 95\% C.L. upper limit on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma} < 10^{-11}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across the full ALP mass range. Notably, we rule out values of $g_{a\gamma}$ above $1.6 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses between 12.4 and 14.5\,eV, improving upon previous limits by an order of magnitude.",
New submissions,A Bayesian approach to modelling spectrometer data chromaticity corrected using beam factors -- II. Model priors and posterior odds,"Peter H. Sims,Judd D. Bowman,Steven G. Murray,John P. Barrett,Rigel C. Cappallo,Colin J. Lonsdale,Nivedita Mahesh,Raul A. Monsalve,Alan E. E. Rogers,Titu Samson,Akshatha K. Vydula",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The reliable detection of the global 21-cm signal, a key tracer of Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, requires meticulous data modelling and robust statistical frameworks for model validation and comparison. In Paper I of this series, we presented the Beam-Factor-based Chromaticity Correction (BFCC) model for spectrometer data processed using BFCC to suppress instrumentally induced spectral structure. We demonstrated that the BFCC model, with complexity calibrated by Bayes factor-based model comparison (BFBMC), enables unbiased recovery of a 21-cm signal consistent with the one reported by EDGES from simulated data. Here, we extend the evaluation of the BFCC model to lower amplitude 21-cm signal scenarios where deriving reliable conclusions about a model's capacity to recover unbiased 21-cm signal estimates using BFBMC is more challenging. Using realistic simulations of chromaticity-corrected EDGES-low spectrometer data, we evaluate three signal amplitude regimes -- null, moderate, and high. We then conduct a Bayesian comparison between the BFCC model and three alternative models previously applied to 21-cm signal estimation from EDGES data. To mitigate biases introduced by systematics in the 21-cm signal model fit, we incorporate the Bayesian Null-Test-Evidence-Ratio (BaNTER) validation framework and implement a Bayesian inference workflow based on posterior odds of the validated models. We demonstrate that, unlike BFBMC alone, this approach consistently recovers 21-cm signal estimates that align with the true signal across all amplitude regimes, advancing robust global 21-cm signal detection methodologies.",
New submissions,Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter,"Yupeng Yang,Qianyong Li,Jiali Hao,Xiujuan Li",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$, are $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.",
New submissions,Schwinger effect in axion inflation on a lattice,"Oksana Iarygina,Evangelos I. Sfakianakis,Axel Brandenburg",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present the first lattice simulations of the nonlinear evolution after axion inflation by self-consistently incorporating currents arising from Schwinger pair production. The tachyonically amplified gauge fields trigger the growth of Schwinger currents, leading to universal values for the conductivity and magnetic field at the onset of strong backreaction and subsequent quenching of gauge field production. We show that the Schwinger effect (prematurely) saturates gauge field production, thereby diminishing the prospects of axion inflation magnetogenesis as a viable solution for blazar observations.",
New submissions,Cosmological bounds on dark matter annihilation using dark ages 21-cm signal,Vivekanand Mohapatra,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on the global 21-cm signal during the dark ages and cosmic dawn eras. The 21-cm line provides a complementary probe for studying the nature of dark matter beyond standard cosmological observables. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the expected absorption amplitude of the dark ages global 21-cm signal is approximately $-42\, \rm mK$. However, energy injection from DM annihilation can significantly heat and ionize the intergalactic medium, potentially altering or even erasing this absorption feature. We evaluate the thermal and ionization history of the gas to derive an upper bound on $f_\chi^2 \langle \sigma v \rangle / M_\chi$ using the dark ages signal, which is free from astrophysical uncertainties. After incorporating observational and theoretical uncertainties arising from future lunar-based experiments and variations in cosmological parameters, respectively -- we obtain a conservative upper limit of $f_\chi^2\langle\sigma v\rangle/M_\chi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is nearly an order of magnitude stronger than the bounds derived from Planck 2018 data.",
New submissions,An iterative CMB lensing estimator minimizing instrumental noise bias,"Louis Legrand,Blake Sherwin,Anthony Challinor,Julien Carron,Gerrit S. Farren",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Noise maps from CMB experiments are generally statistically anisotropic, due to scanning strategies, atmospheric conditions, or instrumental effects. Any mis-modeling of this complex noise can bias the reconstruction of the lensing potential and the measurement of the lensing power spectrum from the observed CMB maps. We introduce a new CMB lensing estimator based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction that is minimally sensitive to these instrumental noise biases. By modifying the likelihood to rely exclusively on correlations between CMB map splits with independent noise realizations, we minimize auto-correlations that contribute to biases. In the regime of many independent splits, this maximum closely approximates the optimal MAP reconstruction of the lensing potential. In simulations, we demonstrate that this method is able to determine lensing observables that are immune to any noise mis-modeling with a negligible cost in signal-to-noise ratio. Our estimator enables unbiased and nearly optimal lensing reconstruction for next-generation CMB surveys.",
Cross submissions,QCD Axion Domain Walls from Super-Cooling First Order Phase Transition,"Kun-Feng Lyu,Yue Zhao",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The QCD axion is a well-motivated hypothetical particle beyond the Standard Model (SM) and a compelling dark matter candidate. Its relic abundance is highly sensitive to the thermal history of the universe when the temperature is around the QCD confinement scale. Meanwhile, the NANOGrav Collaboration has reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background, which could originate from a supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) with a nucleation temperature around the O(MeV-GeV) scale. We explore how such an FOPT might alter the evolution of the QCD axion. Our findings suggest that it could induce the axion to go through a short stage of mini kinetic misalignment. Moreover, in some parameter regime, the formation of QCD axion domain walls becomes generically expected. This has intriguing implications for both the existence of the QCD axion and the FOPT interpretation of the NANOGrav signal.",
Cross submissions,WIMP/FIMP dark matter and primordial black holes with memory burden effect,"Amane Takeshita,Teruyuki Kitabayashi",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The lifetime of primordial black holes (PBHs), which were formed in the early universe, can be extended by the memory burden effect. Light PBHs may be in existence today and become a candidate for dark matter (DM). We assume that DM is made of thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs produced via Hawking radiation of PBHs, and survived PBHs via the memory burden effect. In addition, feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are considered as an alternative to WIMPs. Various similar studies have been conducted either with or without considering the memory burden effect. In this study, we simultaneously account for thermally produced WIMPs or FIMPs and the memory burden effect of PBHs to explain the relic abundance of DM. We show that this abundance is highly sensitive to the memory burden effect in PBHs.",
