New submissions,A Mid-Thirties Crisis: Dissecting the Properties of Gravitational Wave Sources Near the 35 Solar Mass Peak,"Soumendra Kishore Roy,Lieke A. C. van Son,Will M. Farr",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1<20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical merger models, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.",
New submissions,Supermassive black holes and their surroundings: MeV signatures,"Tullia Sbarrato,Marco Ajello,Sara Buson,Denys Malyshev,Dmitry V. Malyshev,Reshmi Mukherjee,Gianpiero Tagliaferri,Fabrizio Tavecchio",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The gravitational potential of supermassive black holes is so powerful that it triggers some of the most intense phenomena in the Universe. Accretion onto these objects and relativistic jet emission from their vicinity are observable across a wide range of frequencies and throughout cosmic history. However, despite this wealth of data, many aspects of their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Investigating this phenomena across all frequencies is crucial, yet some energy windows are still poorly explored. One such window is the MeV energy range: many key signatures related to the emission from the SMBH environment - both in quiescent and active phases - are expected to lie between one and several hundreds MeV. In this work, we explore some of the open questions regarding the behavior and emission processes in the surroundings of SMBHs, and how these questions might be approached. From the elusive nature of Fermi bubbles around our Galactic Centre, to the origin of high-energy neutrinos in the nuclei and jets of Active Galactic Nuclei, to the nature and emission mechanisms of the most powerful blazars, the MeV window stands out as a crucial key to understanding SMBH physics.",
New submissions,A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography,"Hayley J. Macpherson,Asta Heinesen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.",
New submissions,Multi-wavelength variability analysis of the blazar S5 0716+714 during a long-lasting period of low activity,"B. M. Mihov,E. G. Elhosseiny,L. S. Slavcheva-Mihova,A. Takey,M. N. Ismail,R. Mawad",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of the blazar S5 0716+714 from 2022 November 26 to 2023 May 28 using optical telescopes in Egypt and Bulgaria. Data were taken during 84 nights in 11 of which intranight monitoring was performed. We also use optical and gamma-ray survey data. On long-term time-scales, we find a gradual decrease of the S5 0716+714 activity since the beginning of 2020 in both optical and gamma-rays. On short-term time-scales, the individual optical light curves are strongly correlated among each other with no time lags observed. The V-band percentage variability amplitude equals 97.59 +/- 0.02 per cent. We find moderate flatter-when-brighter spectral behaviour with the strength of the 'spectral index - flux' anti-correlation decreasing towards the longer wavelengths. The main feature of the short-term light curves is a transient quasi-periodic oscillation with a period of 43.5 +/- 3.6 d. The V-band light curve is modelled with two helically moving blobs and a synchrotron flare. We estimate the resulting parameters, as well as limits on the radius, magnetic field strength, and electron Lorentz factor of the region responsible for the flare. On intranight time-scales, we find smooth flux variations with no flares and derive a duty cycle in the range ~10-20 per cent. The lack of flares on intranight time-scales could result from a temporarily homogeneous jet flow without formation of turbulent cells in terms of prevented Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The analysis of the data reveals a low activity of S5 0716+714 on all time-scales during the observation period.",
New submissions,Avoiding (photo-$z$) Catastrophe,"A. J. Battisti,E. da Cunha,S. Jin,J. A. Hodge",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Spectral modeling codes that estimate photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) are a powerful and often reliable method for determining redshifts of galaxies. However, there are notable instances where degeneracies in spectral energy distribution (SED) colors lead to `catastrophic' failures. We highlight the case of COSBO-7, a dusty, intermediate-$z$ galaxy that masqueraded as a high-$z$ source, because it demonstrates a unique scenario where photo-$z$ codes run into issues despite extensive multi-wavelength photometry. We advocate that photo-$z$ fitting should aim to: (1) use the entire available SED (UV--radio) whenever possible to help break color degeneracies, (2) allow flexible dust attenuation prescriptions, both in terms of the attenuation curve slope and a varying 2175Å absorption feature, and (3) implement uncertainty floors to account for limitations in spectral models and also on the photometry itself.",
New submissions,Forecasting the Impact of Source Galaxy Photometric Redshift Uncertainties on the LSST $3\times2$pt Analysis,"Tianqing Zhang,Husni Almoubayyed,Rachel Mandelbaum,Markus Michael Rau,Nikolina Šarčević,C. Danielle Leonard,Jeffrey A. Newman,Brett Andrews,Shuang Liang, TheLSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Photometric redshifts of the source galaxies are a key source of systematic uncertainty in the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)'s galaxy clustering and weak lensing analysis, i.e., the $3\times 2$pt analysis. This paper introduces a Fisher forecast code FisherA2Z for the LSST Year 10 (Y10) $3 \times 2$pt and cosmic shear analyses, utilizing a 15-parameter redshift distribution model, with one redshift bias, variance, and outlier rate per tomographic bin. FisherA2Z employs the Core Cosmology Library CCL to compute the large-scale structure power spectrum and incorporates a four-parameter nonlinear alignment model for intrinsic alignments. We evaluate the impact of marginalizing over redshift distribution parameters on weak lensing, forecast biases in cosmological parameters due to redshift errors, and assess cosmological parameter sensitivity to redshift systematic parameters using decision trees. The sensitivity study reveals that for LSST $3\times2$pt analysis, $S_8$ is most sensitive to the mean redshift of the fourth out of the five source tomographic bins, while other cosmological parameters possess different sensitivities. Additionally, we provide cosmological analysis forecasts based on different scenarios of spectroscopic training datasets. We find that the figures-of-merit for the cosmological results increase with the number of spectroscopic training galaxies, and with the completeness of the training set above $z=1.6$, assuming the redshift information comes solely from the training set galaxies without other external constraints.",
New submissions,Modelling Galaxy Clustering and Tomographic Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing with HSC Y3 and SDSS using the Point-Mass Correction Model and Redshift Self-Calibration,"Tianqing Zhang,Sunao Sugiyama,Surhud More,Rachel Mandelbaum,Xiangchong Li,Roohi Dalal,Hironao Miyatake,Atsushi J. Nishizawa,Takahiro Nishimichi,Masamune Oguri,Ken Osato,Markus M. Rau,Masato Shirasaki,Tomomi Sunayama,Masahiro Takada",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The combination of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering is a powerful probe of the cosmological model, and exploration of how to best model and extract this information from the signals is essential. We present the measurement of the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing signals using the SDSS DR11 spectroscopic galaxies as lens galaxies, and the HSC Y3 shear catalog as source galaxies, binned into four tomographic bins by their photometric redshift. The SDSS DR11 galaxies, with a redshift range $0.15<z<0.7$, are binned into three redshift bins, each as a probe for measuring the projected correlation function, $w_p(R_p)$. We measure the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal $\Delta \Sigma (R_p)$ in 12 lens-source bin pairs and show that there is no evidence for significant systematic biases in the measurement with null testing. We combine our $w_p(R_p)$ and $\Delta \Sigma (R_p)$ ($2\times2$pt) data vectors and perform likelihood inference with a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. For $\Delta \Sigma (R_p)$, we extend the lower limit of the scale cut compared to previous HSC Y3 analyses to $2 h^{-1}$Mpc by including a point-mass correction term in addition to the minimal bias model. We present various tests to validate our model and provide extended consistency tests. In the $\Lambda$CDM context, our fiducial model yields $S_8 = 0.804^{+0.051}_{-0.051}$. The $2\times2$pt data vector provides redshift parameter constraints for the third and fourth redshift bins $\Delta z_3 = -0.079^{+0.074}_{-0.084}$, and $\Delta z_4 = -0.203^{+0.167}_{-0.206}$, which is consistent with results from the previous tomographic cosmic shear studies, and serves as the foundation for a future $3\times 2$pt analysis.",
New submissions,"Constraining $Λ$CDM, $ω$CDM, and $ω_0ω_a$CDM models with DESI DR2 BAO: Redshift-Resolved Diagnostics and the Role of $r_d$",Seokcheon Lee,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a detailed comparison of  $\Lambda$CDM, $\omega$CDM, and $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM cosmologies using the latest redshift-resolved BAO measurements from DESI DR2. By separating $r_d$-dependent and $r_d$-independent observables and applying both fixed and model-derived sound horizon values, we test the consistency of each model across 24 observables spanning redshift 0.2 to 2.3. Our results show that the $\omega$CDM model is statistically favored over $\Lambda$CDM, with lower $\chi^2$, AIC, and BIC values and reduced residuals, especially at $z = 0.706$ and 0.934. In contrast, the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model is strongly disfavored, even when using model-specific $r_d$, due to large residuals caused by the unphysical high-redshift behavior.",
New submissions,Cosmology and Source Redshift Constraints from Galaxy Clustering and Tomographic Weak Lensing with HSC Y3 and SDSS using the Point-Mass Correction Model,"Tianqing Zhang,Xiangchong Li,Sunao Sugiyama,Rachel Mandelbaum,Surhud More,Roohi Dalal,Hironao Miyatake,Atsushi J. Nishizawa,Takahiro Nishimichi,Masamune Oguri,Ken Osato,Markus M. Rau,Masato Shirasaki,Tomomi Sunayama,Masahiro Takada",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The combination of galaxy clustering and weak lensing is a powerful probe of the cosmology model. We present a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and weak lensing cosmology using SDSS data as the tracer of dark matter (lens sample) and the HSC Y3 dataset as source galaxies. The analysis divides HSC Y3 galaxies into four tomographic bins for both galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear measurements, and employs a point-mass correction model to utilize galaxy-galaxy lensing signals down to 2$h^{-1}$Mpc, extending up to 70$h^{-1}$Mpc. These strategies enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the galaxy-galaxy lensing data vector. Using a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8 = 0.780^{+0.029}_{-0.030}$, and using a $w$CDM model, we obtain $S_8 = 0.756^{+0.038}_{-0.036}$ with $w = -1.176^{+0.310}_{-0.346}$. We apply uninformative priors on the redshift mean-shift parameters for the third and fourth tomographic bins. Leveraging the self-calibration power of tomographic weak lensing, we measure $\Delta z_3 = -0.112^{+0.046}_{-0.049}$ and $\Delta z_4 = -0.185^{+0.071}_{-0.081}$, in agreement with previous HSC Y3 results. This demonstrates that weak lensing self-calibration can achieve redshift constraints comparable to other methods such as photometric and clustering redshift calibration.",
New submissions,Nonlinear reconstruction of general dark energy theories,"Yunhao Gao,Baojiu Li,Jie Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The large variety and number of dark energy (DE) theories make it impractical to perform detailed analyses on a case-by-case basis, which has motivated proposals to ``parameterize"" theories to reduce the size of theory space. The leading approach to do this is the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE), which can describe general Horndeski-type theories with a small number of observationally accessible time-dependent functions. However, the EFTofDE primarily works for linear perturbations, and extending it to obtain a fully non-linear description of DE theories, which is critical for theories with screening mechanisms, is challenging. In this paper, we present a general method for reconstructing the non-linear DE Lagrangian from the background expansion history and certain linear-perturbation quantities, building upon the EFTofDE framework. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this method is applicable to a wide range of single-scalar-field dark energy and modified gravity theories, including quintessence, scalar-tensor theory, $k$-essence, and generalized cubic Galileon with shift symmetry. For each of these theories, we discuss the validity of the method and factors affecting its results. While this method involves solving differential equations, we find that the initial conditions are not important for quintessence, scalar-tensor theory and $k$-essence, while for shift-symmetric cubic Galileon, the generic tracker solution can help transform differential equations into algebraic equations. This offers a useful framework to connect cosmological observations at the background and linear-perturbation levels to the underlying non-linear dynamics of dark energy, and will enable cosmological simulations to analyze and examine DE theories systematically and in much greater detail.",
New submissions,Numerical treatment of annual modulation of relic neutrinos,"Fabian Zimmer,Shin'ichiro Ando",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present a numerical treatment of the annual modulation of relic neutrinos due to the Sun's gravitational influence. Extending our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework from Milky Way scales to solar system dynamics, we model how cosmic neutrino background densities might vary throughout Earth's orbital cycle. We validate our numerical approach against analytical expectations from previous studies that assumed idealized relic neutrino populations. Our results suggest that the prior gravitational history of neutrinos traversing asymmetric dark matter distributions can affect annual modulation patterns. While our simulations reproduce modulation amplitudes similar to analytical predictions for heavier neutrinos, we find that the amplitude can vary considerably depending on the specific morphology of dark matter halos. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating realistic structure formation effects when predicting potential observational relic neutrino signatures.",
New submissions,Exploring the Quiescent Black Hole Population of Nearby Dwarf Galaxies with the Habitable World Observatory,Fabio Pacucci,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remain a significant unsolved problem in astrophysics, particularly in the low-mass regime, where observations are sparse. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), with its diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution UV-optical spectroscopy, presents a unique opportunity to explore the demographics of massive black holes (MBHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies. We propose a program to dynamically detect quiescent MBHs with masses as low as $10^{4.5} \, \rm M_\odot$ in galaxies within $10-30$ Mpc, by resolving stellar velocity dispersions down to 30 $\rm km \, s^{-1}$. This effort will dramatically extend current black hole-host galaxy scaling relations into the dwarf regime, probing the fundamental connection between black hole seeds and their environments. Using a volume-limited sample of $\sim 100$ dwarf galaxies drawn from existing catalogs, HWO will resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of MBHs and enable precision measurements of stellar kinematics via Ca II triplet absorption lines. These observations will test predictions from competing seed formation scenarios -- light seeds from Population III remnants versus heavy seeds from direct collapse -- and clarify whether dwarf galaxies retain imprints of their initial black hole population. The results will offer critical insight into SMBH formation channel and the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies across cosmic time.",
New submissions,Quantifying the impact of detection bias from blended galaxies on cosmic shear surveys,"Eray Genc,Peter Schneider,Sandra Unruh,Tim Schrabback",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Increasingly large areas in cosmic shear surveys lead to a reduction of statistical errors, necessitating to control systematic errors increasingly better. One of these systematic effects was initially studied by Hartlap et al. in 2011, namely that image overlap with (bright foreground) galaxies may prevent some distant (source) galaxies to remain undetected. Since this overlap is more likely to occur in regions of high foreground density -- which tend to be the regions in which the shear is largest -- this detection bias would cause an underestimation of the estimated shear correlation function. This detection bias adds to the possible systematic of image blending, where nearby pairs or multiplets of images render shear estimates more uncertain and thus may cause a reduction in their statistical weight. Based on simulations with data from the Kilo-Degree Survey, we study the conditions under which images are not detected. We find an approximate analytic expression for the detection probability in terms of the separation and brightness ratio to the neighbouring galaxies. Applying this fitting formula to weak lensing ray tracing through, and the galaxy distribution in the Millennium Simulation, we estimate that the detection bias alone leads to an underestimate of $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3}$ by almost 2\% and can therefore not be neglected in current and forthcoming cosmic shear surveys.",
New submissions,DESI DR2 reference mocks: clustering results from Uchuu-BGS and LRG,"E. Fernández-García,F. Prada,A. Smith,J. DeRose,A. J. Ross,S. Bailey,M. S. Wang,Z. Ding,C. Guandalin,C. Lamman,R.

Sprayberry,G. Tarlé,B. A. Weaver,P. Zarrouk,R. Zhou",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The aim of this work is to construct mock galaxy catalogues that accurately reproduce the redshift evolution of galaxy number density, clustering statistics, and baryonic properties, such as stellar mass for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and absolute magnitude in the $r$-band for the bright galaxy sample (BGS), based on the first three years of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). To achieve this, we applied the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) technique to the Uchuu $N$-body simulation, which follows the evolution of 2.1 trillion particles within a volume of $8\,h^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{3}$, assuming a Planck base-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using SHAM, we populated Uchuu subhalos with LRGs and BGS-BRIGHT ($r<19.5$) galaxies up to redshift $z=1.1$, assigning stellar masses to LRGs and luminosities to BGS galaxies (up to $M_{\rm r}\leq 20$). Furthermore, we analyzed the clustering dependence on stellar mass and luminosity for each tracer. Our results show that the Uchuu BGS-BRIGHT and LRG mocks accurately reproduce the observed redshift evolution of clustering, with better than 5\% agreement for separations of $1<r<20\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and below 10\% for $0.1<r<1\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. For the Uchuu-LRG mock, we successfully captured the stellar mass dependence of clustering, while for the Uchuu-BGS mock, we replicated the clustering for various volume-limited subsamples. We also find good agreement between the data and mocks in the dependence of large-scale bias on luminosity for BGS-BRIGHT galaxies and on stellar mass for LRGs. Altogether, these results equip DESI with robust tools for generating high-fidelity lightcones for the remainder of the survey, thereby enhancing our understanding of the galaxy--halo connection.",
New submissions,Cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing with extended SubHalo Abundance Matching,"Constance Mahony,Sergio Contreras,Raul E. Angulo,David Alonso,Christos Georgiou,Andrej Dvornik",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present the first cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing using extended SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAMe). We analyse stellar mass-selected Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) galaxy clustering and Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) galaxy-galaxy lensing and find constraints on $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.793^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$, in agreement with Planck at 1.7$\sigma$, and consistent with previous results. We are able to constrain all 5 SHAMe parameters, which describe the galaxy-subhalo connection. We validate our methodology by first applying it to simulated catalogues, generated from the TNG300 simulation, which mimic the stellar mass selection of our real data. We show that we are able to recover the input cosmology for both our fiducial and all-scale analyses. Our all-scale analysis extends to scales of galaxy-galaxy lensing below $r_\mathrm{p}<1.4\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$, which we exclude in our fiducial analysis to avoid baryonic effects. When including all scales, we find a value of $S_8$, which is 1.26$\sigma$ higher than our fiducial result (against naive expectations where baryonic feedback should lead to small-scale power suppression), and in agreement with Planck at 0.9$\sigma$. We also find a 21% tighter constraint on $S_8$ and a 29% tighter constraint on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ compared to our fiducial analysis. This work shows the power and potential of joint small-scale galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses using SHAMe.",
New submissions,Luminosity Function of Galaxies in Voids: A Modification Inspired by Excursion Set Theory,"Zeynab Ashurikisomi,Shant Baghram",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In the standard picture of cosmology, the galaxies reside in dark matter (DM) halos. DM halos are distributed in the cosmic web in different environments. The luminosity of the galaxies in different environments can be used as a probe to assess a cosmological model. This study focuses on the properties of galaxies in void regions, where halos typically do not experience extreme conditions. By examining the galaxy luminosity function, we aim to understand the dependence of galaxy properties on their environment and redshift so that later, we could use this as a tool to evaluate cosmological models. We employ the Excursion Set Theory to incorporate parameters related to the number density of DM halos into the luminosity function. Using the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and 2dFGRS datasets, we fit our theoretical models to observational data, examining the environmental and redshift dependence of the galaxy luminosity function. Our results indicate that we model the galaxy luminosity function in voids effectively by considering the linear density contrast of the environment and the growth function $D(z)$ for redshift dependence. This study provides a model for the environmental dependence of galaxy luminosity function that offers an improvement in the $\chi ^2$ parameter compared to the previously proposed model in \cite{mcnaught2014galaxy}. Both BIC and AIC tests support the superiority of this model for the void region.",
New submissions,Tidal Suppression of Fuzzy Dark Matter Heating in Milky Way Satellite Galaxies,"Yu-Ming Yang,Zhao-Chen Zhang,Xiao-Jun Bi,Peng-Fei Yin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Many previous studies have imposed stringent constraints on the particle mass of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) by analyzing observations of Galactic satellite galaxies, which show no significant evidence of the heating effect predicted by FDM. However, these analyses have generally neglected the tidal influence of the Milky Way, which can substantially suppress the FDM-induced heating in satellites. This oversight arises from computational challenges of accurately capturing the tidal effects in FDM simulations. In this study, we present a novel simulation framework that, for the first time, enables the simulation of an FDM-stellar system within an observationally motivated gravitational potential of the Milky Way. This framework incorporates the diverse Galactic components, including the gravitational influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using the Fornax dwarf galaxy as a case study, we demonstrate that tidal effects significantly alleviate the tension between observational data and the predicted heating effect for an FDM particle mass of $m_a\sim 10^{-22}$ eV.",
New submissions,Generative modeling of convergence maps based on predicted one-point statistics,"Vilasini Tinnaneri Sreekanth,Jean-Luc Starck,Sandrine Codis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Context: Weak gravitational lensing is a key cosmological probe for current and future large-scale surveys. While power spectra are commonly used for analyses, they fail to capture non-Gaussian information from nonlinear structure formation, necessitating higher-order statistics and methods for efficient map generation. Aims: To develop an emulator that generates accurate convergence maps directly from an input power spectrum and wavelet l1-norm without relying on computationally intensive simulations. Methods: We use either numerical or theoretical predictions to construct convergence maps by iteratively adjusting wavelet coefficients to match target marginal distributions and their inter-scale dependencies, incorporating higher-order statistical information. Results: The resulting kappa maps accurately reproduce the input power spectrum and exhibit higher-order statistical properties consistent with the input predictions, providing an efficient tool for weak lensing analyses.",
New submissions,Inflationary magnetogenesis beyond slow-roll and its induced gravitational waves,"Bill Atkins,Debika Chowdhury,Alisha Marriott-Best,Gianmassimo Tasinato",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The origin of magnetic fields observed on both astrophysical and cosmological scales is a compelling problem that has the potential to shed light on the early Universe. We analytically investigate inflationary magnetogenesis in scenarios where a brief departure from slow-roll inflation - akin to mechanisms proposed for primordial black hole formation - leads to enhanced magnetic field generation with a growing power spectrum. Focusing on the Ratra model, we derive an analytic bound on the growth of the magnetic field power spectrum in this context, showing that the spectral index can reach $d \ln {\cal P}_B / d \ln k = 4.75$ during the growth phase. This growth enables amplification from CMB-safe large-scale amplitudes to values of astrophysical relevance. We further compute the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by the resulting magnetic fields, incorporating their rich spectral features. Under suitable conditions, the induced signal exhibits a characteristic frequency dependence and amplitude within reach of future gravitational wave observatories, providing a distinctive signature of this mechanism and a specific class of templates for upcoming gravitational wave searches.",
New submissions,Kinematic Distortions of the High-Redshift Universe as Seen from Quasar Proper Motions,Valeri V. Makarov,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Advances in optical astrometry allow us to infer the non-radial kinematic structure of the Universe directly from observations. Here I use a supervised machine learning neural network method to predict 1.57 million redshifts based on several photometric and metadata classifier parameters from the unWISE mid-infrared database and from Gaia. These estimates are used to divide the sample into three redshift bins: 1-2, 2-3, and $>3$. For each subset, all available Gaia proper motions are used in a global vector spherical harmonic solution to degree 3 (30 fitting vector functions). I find significant differences in a few fitted proper motion patterns at different redshifts. The largest signals are seen in the comparison of the vector spherical harmonic fits for the 1-2 and 2-3 redshift bins. The significant harmonics include a rigid spin, a dipole glide from the north Galactic pole to the south and an additional quadrupole distortion. Validation tests with filtered subsamples indicate that the detected effect can be caused by hidden systematic errors in astrometry. The results are verified by using an independent source of redshifts and computing the observer's Galactocentric acceleration. This study offers a new observational test of alternative cosmological models.",
New submissions,Where are all the dark galaxies? Predicting galaxy/halo locations from their bright neighbors,"Alice Chen,Niayesh Afshordi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Astronomical objects in our universe that are too faint to be directly detectable exist and are important - an obvious example being dark matter. The same can also apply to very faint baryonic objects, such as low luminosity dwarf galaxies and gravitationally compact objects (e.g., rogue planets, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, dark sirens). While they are very difficult to observe directly, they have locations that are highly important when studying astrophysical phenomena. Here, we use a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression to model the probability of a dark object's existence as a function of their separation distances to their closest two ``bright"" (directly observable) neighbors, and the distances of these bright objects to each other. An advantage of this algorithm is that it is interpretable by humans and can be used to make reproducible predictions. Galaxies with masses above $10^9 M_{\odot}$ and halos above $10^{12} M_{\odot} $ are the objects that we separate into ``bright"" and ``dark"" to be used in our analysis. We find that it is possible to predict the density of dark objects using an analytic expression that depends on their distances to their closest bright neighbors in Illustris-TNG galaxy formation simulations, which is significantly better than the (linear) scale-dependent biasing prediction for $k \sim 1.0~ h$Mpc$^{-1}$ (and potentially beyond, if allowed by the resolution). This could potentially open the avenue for finding dark objects based on their vicinity to directly observable bright sources and make future surveys more targeted and efficient.",
New submissions,The Cosmological analysis of X-ray cluster surveys VII. Bypassing scaling relations with Lagrangian Deep Learning and Simulation-based inference,"Nicolas Cerardi,Marguerite Pierre,François Lanusse,Xavier Corap",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Galaxy clusters, the pinnacle of structure formation in our universe, are a powerful cosmological probe. Several approaches have been proposed to express cluster number counts, but all these methods rely on empirical explicit scaling relations that link observed properties to the total cluster mass. These scaling relations are over-parametrised, inducing some degeneracy with cosmology. Moreover, they do not provide a direct handle on the numerous non-gravitational phenomena that affect the physics of the intra-cluster medium. We present a proof-of-concept to model cluster number counts, that bypasses the explicit use of scaling relations. We rather implement the effect of several astrophysical processes to describe the cluster properties. We then evaluate the performances of this modelling for the cosmological inference. We developed an accelerated machine learning baryonic field-emulator, built upon the Lagrangian Deep Learning method and trained on the CAMELS simulations. We then created a pipeline that simulates cluster counts in terms of XMM observable quantities. We finally compare the performances of our model, with that involving scaling relations, for the purpose of cosmological inference based on simulations. Our model correctly reproduces the cluster population from the calibration simulations at the fiducial parameter values, and allows us to constrain feedback mechanisms. The cosmological-inference analyses indicate that our simulation-based model is less degenerate than the approach using scaling relations. This novel approach to model observed cluster number counts from simulations opens interesting perspectives for cluster cosmology. It has the potential to overcome the limitations of the standard approach, provided that the resolution and the volume of the simulations will allow a most realistic implementation of the complex phenomena driving cluster evolution.",
New submissions,Kinetic Fragmentation of the QCD Axion on the Lattice,"Matteo Fasiello,Joanes Lizarraga,Alexandros Papageorgiou,Ander Urio",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Kinetic misalignment, one of the most compelling scenarios for the non-thermal generation of axion dark matter, is generally accompanied by axion fragmentation, a process in which the energy of the axion condensate is transferred to its perturbations. The dynamics of fragmentation, at least in the context of dark matter production, have so far been studied semi-analytically using perturbation theory. In this work, we present the first classical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of dark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our findings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice lead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a sustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller occupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the final dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear approximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction. This broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact on axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic fragmentation.",
New submissions,Neutrino mass tension or suppressed growth rate of matter perturbations?,"William Giarè,Olga Mena,Enrico Specogna,Eleonora Di Valentino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM value ($\gamma \simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\sum m_\nu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$. This preference increases to $\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\sum m_\nu \ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.",
New submissions,Cosmological Frequency Combs,"Oem Trivedi,Madhurendra Mishra,Adarsh Ganesan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD),"We identify a new class of time periodic attractor solutions in scalar field cosmology, which we term Cosmological Frequency Combs (CFC). These solutions arise in exponential quintessence models with a phantom matter background and exhibit coherent phase-locked oscillations in the scalar field's normalized variables. We demonstrate that such dynamics induce modulations in observables like the Hubble parameter and growth rate, offering a dynamical mechanism to even address the H0 tension exactly. Our results uncover a previously unexplored phase of cosmic acceleration, linking the concept of frequency combs to large scale cosmological evolution.",
New submissions,ML-Driven Strong Lens Discoveries: Down to $θ_E \sim 0.03''$ and $M_\mathrm{halo}< 10^{11} M_\odot$,"Ethan Silver,R. Wang,Xiaosheng Huang,A. Bolton,C. Storfer,S. Banka",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present results on extending the strong lens discovery space down to much smaller Einstein radii ($\theta_E\lesssim0.03''$) and much lower halo mass ($M_\mathrm{halo}<10^{11}M_\odot$) through the combination of JWST observations and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we forecast detectable strong lenses with JWST using CosmoDC2 as the lens catalog, and a source catalog down to 29th magnitude. By further incorporating the VELA hydrodynamical simulations of high-redshift galaxies, we simulate strong lenses. We train a ResNet on these images, achieving near-100\% completeness and purity for ``conventional"" strong lenses ($\theta_E\gtrsim 0.5''$), applicable to JWST, HST, the Roman Space Telescope and Euclid VIS. For the first time, we also search for very low halo mass strong lenses ($M_{halo}<10^{11}M_\odot$) in simulations, with $\theta_E\ll 0.5''$, down to the best resolution ($0.03''$) and depth (10,000~sec) limits of JWST using ResNet. A U-Net model is employed to pinpoint these small lenses in images, which are otherwise virtually impossible for human detection. Our results indicate that JWST can find $\sim 17$/deg$^2$ such low-halo-mass lenses, with the locations of $\sim 1.1$/deg$^2$ of these detectable by the U-Net at $\sim100$\% precision (and $\sim 7.0$/deg$^2$ at a 99.0\% precision). To validate our model for finding ``conventional"" strong lenses, we apply it to HST images, discovering two new strong lens candidates previously missed by human classifiers in a crowdsourcing project (Garvin et al. 2022). This study demonstrates the (potentially ``superhuman"") advantages of ML combined with current and future space telescopes for detecting conventional, and especially, low-halo-mass strong lenses, which are critical for testing CDM models.",
New submissions,Universal lower bound on the axion decay constant from free streaming effects,"Keisuke Harigaya,Wayne Hu,Rayne Liu,Huangyu Xiao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We show that enhancement of the axion relic abundance compared to the standard misalignment contribution generically leads to the production of nonzero momentum axion modes, resulting in warm dark matter behavior and enhanced isocurvature perturbations. It leads to universal constraints on the axion parameter space that are independent of detailed model assumptions and cosmological history. For models enhancing relic abundance with gradient axion modes, observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest impose a lower bound on the axion decay constant, $f_a \gtrsim 10^{15} {\rm GeV}\,(10^{-18}{\rm eV}/m_a)$, from the free-streaming effect. For models relying on the delay of coherent axion oscillations, we obtain a slightly weaker bound, $f_a \gtrsim 10^{14} {\rm GeV}\,(10^{-18}{\rm eV}/m_a)$. We make relatively conservative choices to establish these universal bounds but also provide scaling parameters that can be calibrated for stronger constraints in concrete models and updated as observations improve.",
Cross submissions,PQ-ball and its Real Scalar Analogue in an Expanding Universe,"Kazunori Nakayama,Masaki Yamada",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We demonstrate the formation of quasi-stable localized scalar configurations in spontaneously symmetry breaking U(1) model by 3+1-dimensional classical lattice simulations. Such configurations are called PQ-balls, as the primary motivation of this kind of configuration is Peccei-Quinn theory under the kinetic misalignment mechanism. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that they can form if the PQ charge is generated through the coherent rotation of a complex scalar field in the complex plane, via dynamics analogous to the Affleck-Dine mechanism. These configurations subsequently decay due to the U(1)-breaking effect induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate the formation and decay of oscillons in a similar setup in a real scalar field theory.",
Cross submissions,Searching for intermediate mass ratio binary black hole mergers in the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA,"Mark Ho-Yeuk Cheung,Digvijay Wadekar,Ajit Kumar Mehta,Tousif Islam,Javier Roulet,Emanuele Berti,Tejaswi Venumadhav,Barak Zackay,Matias Zaldarriaga",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of binary black holes with mass ratios $10^{-4}\lesssim q \lesssim 0.1$ are astrophysically interesting sources of gravitational waves. Mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with stellar-mass black holes would be IMRIs, so their detection can help us probe the formation mechanisms of IMBHs. They can also help us perform precise tests of general relativity due to the presence of strong higher-order mode emission. We perform a search for aligned-spin IMRIs within the data of the two LIGO detectors in the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, including higher modes in the template banks for the first time. We use the IAS-HM pipeline for our search and construct template banks in the range $1/100 < q<1/18$ using the SEOBNRv5HM waveform model. Our banks retain a similar level of effectualness for IMRPhenomXHM and BHPTNRSur2dq1e3 waveforms, making our search results relatively robust against waveform systematics. We show that the sensitivity volume of the search increases by up to $\sim 500\%$ upon inclusion of higher modes. We do not find any significant candidates with inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) $> 1$ year in the O3 data. This gives us upper limits on the IMRI merger rate in the local Universe, ranging from $\sim 30$ to $10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ depending on the masses of the black holes in the binary. These constraints are consistent with rate predictions in the literature. Our projections indicate that we would be able to detect IMRIs or constrain some of their proposed formation channels in the fourth (O4) and fifth (O5) observing runs.",
Cross submissions,Impact of a complex scalar spectator field on baryon asymmetry within spontaneous baryogenesis,"Mattia Dubbini,Orlando Luongo,Marco Muccino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We extend the framework of spontaneous baryogenesis by investigating the generation of baryon asymmetry when the inflaton, $\theta$, is minimally coupled with a complex spectator scalar field $\phi$, as $\theta^2|\phi|^2$. To do so, we also consider $\phi$ non-minimally coupled with the Ricci scalar curvature $R$ through a Yukawa-like interaction. We do not consider further interactions of the spectator field with the fermions of the Standard Model, considering it \emph{de facto} as a dark scalar field. In evaluating the violation of the baryon-number conservation during the reheating epoch, in a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe, we follow a semiclassical approach, where $\theta$, $\phi$ and gravity are considered as classical fields, whereas the fermions are quantized. We solve the equations of motion for the inflaton and spectator fields, respectively at first and zero-order in perturbation theory, neglecting at first stage the expansion of the universe. Afterwards, we quantify how the spectator field modifies the inflationary dynamics and thus find the baryon asymmetry produced via the inflaton decays into fermion-antifermion pairs by computing the corresponding decay amplitudes. We therefore obtain small first order correction to standard spontaneous baryogenesis and finally discuss the mass-mixing between fermions. Accordingly, the effects of considering the universe expansion are accounted, showing when the coupling between $\phi$ and $R$ becomes noticeable in altering the overall baryon asymmetry.",
Cross submissions,Flux of Extragalactic Dark Matter in Direct Detection Experiments,"Shokhruz Kakharov,Abraham Loeb",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We calculate the contribution of extragalactic dark matter to the local dark matter density and flux in the Milky Way. By analyzing the Galactic escape velocity as a function of direction, we establish the criterion for separating dark matter particles bound to the Milky Way and those originating from the Local Group environment. Our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of dark matter particles in the Solar neighborhood have an extragalactic origin, contributing nearly 38% of the total mass flux. The directional dependence of this extragalactic component shows significant anisotropy across the sky, with implications for direct detection experiments. We provide quantitative predictions for detection rates and signatures that could help identify the extragalactic dark matter component in current and future experiments.",
Cross submissions,"Gravitational waves from a dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition","Aleksandr Chatrchyan,M.C. David Marsh,Charalampos Nikolis",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We show that a `QCD dilaton' field, whose vacuum expectation value sets the strong coupling, can render the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) confinement transition first-order. The QCD dilaton is cosmologically attracted to a false vacuum at weak coupling in the early universe. Quantum tunnelling towards the true vacuum triggers prompt chiral symmetry breaking and confinement of QCD, leading to detonating bubbles of the hadronic phase. We find that plasma sound waves produced by this dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition generate a stochastic gravitational wave signal strikingly similar to the recently detected gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Arrays. We briefly comment on how this theory can be probed through collider experiments and cosmology.",
Cross submissions,"Symmetries of Hot SM, Magnetic Flux & Baryogenesis from Helicity Decay","Yuta Hamada,Kyohei Mukaida,Fumio Uchida",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We revisit the electroweak crossover of the Standard Model (SM) in the early Universe, focusing on the interplay between generalized global symmetries, magnetic flux dynamics, and baryogenesis. Employing the dimensionally reduced 3d effective field theory of the SM at high temperature, we identify the symmetry structure -- including higher-form and magnetic symmetries -- and analyze their spontaneous breaking patterns across the crossover. We further define a gauge-invariant mixing angle that interpolates between $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{em}$ magnetic fields. Based on this framework, we examine baryogenesis via decaying magnetic helicity and identify three key effects: the baryon asymmetry is modified by an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor due to (1) the gauge-invariant definition of the mixing angle and (2) the approximate conservation of the unconfined magnetic flux; (3) a novel non-perturbative process in the presence of magnetic flux, which has been overlooked in previous analyses. Our findings suggest that the previous estimation of baryon asymmetry from the magnetic helicity decay may have sizable uncertainties, and we caution against relying on it, calling for further investigation.",
Cross submissions,$E_6$ Unification of Freeze-In Dark Matter and Leptogenesis,"Adeela Afzal,Rishav Roshan",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the possibility of \emph{freeze-in} dark matter production and baryogenesis in an $E_6$ extension of the Standard Model, featuring a residual $U(1)_{\psi'}$ gauge symmetry. This symmetry arises from a linear combination of $U(1)\chi$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$, both of which are subgroups of the $E_6$. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\psi'}$ symmetry governs the dynamics of a singlet fermion, which naturally serves as a freeze-in dark matter candidate. The dark matter mass arises from dimension-five operators, and a discrete symmetry ensures their stability. We show that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic abundance for dark matter masses between few MeV to a few hundred GeV. Simultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.",

We calculate analytically the amplitude and the phase of the quadratic quasi-normal modes as well as its dependence on the black hole spin.,

We place robust and competitive constraints on various dark matter models, such as axion-like particles, scalars and sterile neutrinos, for masses between $\sim30$~eV and $10$~keV, and project forecasts to illustrate the potential of this target. We discuss how these constraints can be significantly improved by considering a more refined sample of molecular clouds near the Galactic Center and above the Galactic plane, a detailed modeling of the cosmic-ray ionization contribution and, potentially, a more refined analysis of the gas density in clouds through dust extinction maps. Thus, ionization of molecular clouds emerges as one of the most powerful tools for probing sub-keV dark matter.",
