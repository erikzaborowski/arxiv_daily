New submissions,Towards a Robust Machine-Learning Pipeline for 21-cm Cosmology Data Analysis I: A Roadmap for Development and Demonstration of Robustness Against PSF Modeling Errors,"Madhurima Choudhury,Jonathan C. Pober",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a powerful probe of the evolution of the Universe. However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal from radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground removal, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for instrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers, where we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to directly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread function (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding to input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to obtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict $\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of PSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna layout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed these alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images with the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF variations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\rm x_{HI}$, with errors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and discuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based parameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve the robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm surveys. In concluding, we also discuss how this approach to incorporating realistic instrument error into an ML analysis pipeline can be expanded to include multiple other effects.",
New submissions,Recovering unbiased CMB polarization maps using modern ground-based experiments with minimal assumptions about atmospheric emission,"Simon Biquard,Josquin Errard,Radek Stompor",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a study of unbiased reconstruction of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization maps from data collected by modern ground-based observatories. Atmospheric emission is a major source of correlated noise in such experiments, complicating the recovery of faint cosmological signals. We consider estimators that require minimal assumptions about unpolarized atmospheric emission properties, instead exploiting hardware solutions commonly implemented in modern instruments, such as pairs of orthogonal antennas in each focal plane pixel, and polarization signal modulation via a continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP). We focus on two techniques: (i) statistical down-weighting of low-frequency atmospheric signals, and (ii) pair-differencing (PD), which involves differencing signals collected by two detectors in the same focal plane pixel. We compare their performance against the idealized case where the atmospheric signal is perfectly known and cleanly subtracted. We show that PD can be derived from maximum likelihood principles under general assumptions about the atmospheric signal, optimizing map sensitivity. In the absence of instrumental systematics but with reasonable detector noise variations, PD yields polarized sky maps with noise levels only slightly worse than the ideal case. While down-weighting could match this performance, it requires highly accurate atmospheric models that are not readily available. PD performance is affected by instrumental systematics, particularly those leaking atmospheric signal to the difference time stream. However, effects like gain mismatch are efficiently mitigated by a rotating HWP, making PD a competitive, robust, and efficient solution for CMB polarization mapmaking without atmospheric modeling.",
New submissions,CLASH-VLT: Constraining deviation from GR with the mass profiles of nine massive galaxy clusters,"L. Pizzuti,A. Biviano,K. Umetsu,E. Agostoni,A. Autorino,A. M. Pombo,A. Mercurio,M. D'Addona",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the anisotropic stress parameter, $\eta=\Psi/\Phi$, defined as the ratio of the gravitational potentials in the linearly perturbed Friedmann-Lemaître Robertson-Walker metric, as a probe of deviations from general relativity across astrophysical to cosmological scales. Using mass profiles reconstructed from high-precision lensing and kinematics of nine galaxy clusters from the CLASH-VLT sample, we derive $\eta(r)$ as a function of the radial distance from the cluster centres, over the range $[0.1 \,\text{Mpc},1.2\,r_{200}^L]$, where $r_{200}^L$ is virial radius best-fit from lensing data. When using a Navarro-Frenk-White or an Hernquist profile to model the total matter distribution, we find consistency with general relativity ($\eta = 1$) within $2\sigma$ for the full radial range for all the sampled clusters. However, adopting a Burkert profile introduces mild tension with general relativity, reaching the $3\sigma$ level in two systems. Assuming a negligible time-dependence in the redshift range spawned by the clusters, we obtain the joint constraint $\eta (r= 1.0 \, \text{Mpc}) = 0.93^{+0.48}_{-0.40}$ (stat) $\pm 0.47$ (syst) at $95\% $ confidence level -- an improvement of approximately $40\%$ over previous estimates. We discuss the impact of systematics on the constraints, and we highlight the implications of this result for current and upcoming cluster surveys.",
New submissions,The Noise of Vacuum,Gabriela Barenboim(IFIC),Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the evolution of primordial cosmological perturbations in a vacuum decay model where de Sitter space transitions to radiation domination through quantum-thermal decay processes. Unlike standard inflation, this framework generates curvature perturbations through stochastic noise from vacuum decay rather than quantum fluctuations of an inflaton field. We derive the stochastic differential equation governing the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}(t)$ and show that any horizon crossing is brief and does not constitute the primary mechanism for perturbation generation. Scale dependence emerges from spatial correlations in the noise rather than horizon crossing dynamics. The model naturally addresses the horizon and flatness problems through initial thermal equilibrium in de Sitter space and predicts zero tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that spatially correlated noise can generate observationally viable spectral tilts while maintaining Gaussian statistics.",
New submissions,Reverberation lags viewed in hard X-rays from an accreting stellar-mass black hole,"Bei You,Wei Yu,Adam Ingram,Barbara De Marco,Jin-Lu Qu,Zong-Hong Zhu,Andrea Santangelo,Sai-En Xu",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Accreting black holes are thought to swallow matter in the form of a disk and a hot cloud of plasma that glows brightly in X-rays, known as the corona. The X-ray emitting region is far too small to be directly imaged, but rapid variability of the X-ray signal can be used to infer the geometry by measuring time lags caused by material propagating towards the black hole and by coronal X-rays reflecting off the disk to imprint a reverberation lag. Reverberation lags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron emission line at $\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\sim 30$ keV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is much more challenging to detect reverberation lags from stellar-mass black holes because they are more than a million times smaller. Previous reverberation lag measurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus been limited to energies below 10 keV. Here we report on the first detection of the Compton hump reverberation feature from an X-ray binary, achieved by measuring lags in the broad energy range of $\sim 1-150$ keV. The accompanying detection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation and provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray binaries are governed by an ubiquitous process. Reverberation lags are prominent only in the most rapid variability, whereas lags in the slower variability are commonly attributed to propagating mass accretion rate perturbations. Our lag measurements up to the highest energy to date reveal that this lag in the slower variability evolves dramatically on timescales of days.",
New submissions,Overdispersed radio source counts and excess radio dipole detection,"Lukas Böhme,Dominik J. Schwarz,Prabhakar Tiwari,Morteza Pashapour-Ahmadabadi,Benedict Bahr-Kalus,Maciej Bilicki,Catherine L. Hale,Caroline S. Heneka,Thilo M. Siewert",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The source count dipole from wide-area radio continuum surveys allows us to test the cosmological standard model. Many radio sources have multiple components, which can cause an overdispersion of the source counts distribution. We account for this effect via a new Bayesian estimator, based on the negative binomial distribution. Combining the two best understood wide-area surveys, NVSS and RACS-low, and the deepest wide-area survey, LoTSS-DR2, we find that the source count dipole exceeds its expected value as the kinematic dipole amplitude from standard cosmology by a factor of $3.67 \pm 0.49$ -- a $5.4\sigma$ discrepancy.",
New submissions,The Hubble Tension resolved by the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations Measurements,"X. D. Jia,J. P. Hu,D. H. Gao,S. X. Yi,F. Y. Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.",
New submissions,Late-Time Cosmological Constraints on Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy,"Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano,Andronikos Paliathanasis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy is a one-parameter extension of the standard HDE framework, in which the horizon entropy is reformulated using Kaniadakis entropy. At the cosmological level, it has been shown to give rise to modified Friedmann equations, leading to a richer phenomenology compared to $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we test the Kanadiakis holography model against multiple late-time observational probes, including Type Ia supernovae from PantheonPlus and Union3, Cosmic Chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Using a Bayesian inference approach with MCMC methods, we constrain the cosmological parameters of the model and evaluate its performance against $\Lambda$CDM through the Akaike Information Criterion. We find that Kaniadakis holography can provide a better fit for some data combinations, although $\Lambda$CDM remains slightly statistically favored overall. These results highlight Kaniadakis holography as a competitive alternative to the standard cosmological model, offering valuable insights into the role of generalized entropy in dark energy dynamics.",
New submissions,Challenges of standard halo models in constraining galaxy properties from CIB anisotropies,"Athanasia Gkogkou,Guilaine Lagache,Matthieu Béthermin,Abhishek Maniyar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The halo model, combined with halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescriptions, is widely used to interpret cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies and connect star-forming galaxies to large-scale structure. Recent implementations adopt more physical parameterizations, but it remains unclear whether these models reliably recover astrophysical quantities. We test whether current CIB halo models can constrain the star formation efficiency, $\eta(M_h,z)$, and the halo mass where it peaks, $M_{\rm max}$, when fitted to mock data. We examine whether discrepancies arise from emission assumptions (the HOD ingredients) or from more fundamental components, such as bias and matter clustering. Using the M21 CIB HOD model within the halo framework, we fit mock CIB power spectra and star formation rate density (SFRD) data from the SIDES-Uchuu simulation, then repeat the analysis with a simplified simulation (SSU) matched to the HOD assumptions. Comparing best-fit parameters to known inputs, we find that although the M21 model fits the mock data well, it fails to recover intrinsic parameters, especially $M_{\rm max}$, even when applied to data generated with consistent assumptions. Emission-related quantities (SFRD, emissivity) agree within 5%, but the two-halo term shows a redshift- and scale-dependent offset exceeding 20%, likely due to the linear treatment of halo bias and matter clustering. Scatter in the SFR-halo mass relation and spectral energy distributions significantly impacts shot noise ($\sim 50\%$) but only modestly ($<10\%$) the clustered signal. We conclude that robust recovery of physical parameters from CIB clustering requires improved cosmological ingredients in halo models, including scale-dependent halo bias and nonlinear matter power spectra, alongside refined emission modeling.",
New submissions,Cosmological constraints on Galileon dark energy with broken shift symmetry,"William J. Wolf,Pedro G. Ferreira,Carlos García-García",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.",
New submissions,Tracing the high-z cosmic web with Quaia: catalogues of voids and clusters in the quasar distribution,"Nestor Arsenov,András Kovács,Mar Pérez Sar,Ágnes Bogdán,Francesco Sinigaglia,Francisco-Shu Kitaura,Ginevra Favole,Lyuba Slavcheva-Mihova",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Understanding the formation and evolution of the cosmic web of galaxies is a fundamental goal of cosmology, using various tracers of the cosmic large-scale structure at an ever wider range of redshifts. Our principal aim is to advance the mapping of the cosmic web at high redshifts using observational and synthetic catalogues of quasars (QSOs), which offer a powerful probe of structure formation and the validity of the concordance cosmological model. In this analysis, we selected 708,483 QSOs at $0.8<z<2.2$ from the Quaia data set, allowing a reconstruction of the matter density field using 24,372 deg$^2$ sky area with a well-understood selection function, and thus going beyond previous studies. Using the REVOLVER method, we created catalogues of voids and clusters based on the estimation of the local density at QSO positions with Voronoi tessellation. We tested the consistency of Quaia data and 50 mock catalogues, including various parameters of the voids and clusters in data subsets, and also measurements of the density profiles of these cosmic super-structures at $100 h^{-1}$Mpc scales. We identified 12,842 voids and 41,111 clusters in the distribution of Quaia QSOs. The agreement between data and mocks is at a level of 5-10%, considering void and cluster radii, average inner density, and density profiles. In particular, we tested the role of survey mask proximity effects in the void and cluster detection, which albeit present, are consistent in simulations and observations. The largest voids and clusters reach $R_{eff} \approx 250 h^{-1}$Mpc and $150 h^{-1}$Mpc, respectively, but without evidence for ultra-large cosmic structures exceeding the dimensions of the largest structures in the mocks. As an important deliverable, we share our density field estimation, void catalogues, and cluster catalogues with the public, allowing various additional cross-correlation probes at high-z.",
New submissions,The origin of the intra-cluster light in The Three Hundred simulations,"A. Contreras-Santos,A. Knebe,W. Cui,I. Alonso Asensio,C. Dalla Vecchia,R. Haggar,R. A. Mostoghiu Paun,F. R. Pearce,E. Rasia,G. Martin,S. E. Nuza,G. Yepes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We investigate the origin and formation mechanisms of the intra-cluster light (ICL) in The Three Hundred simulations, a set of 324 hydrodynamically resimulated massive galaxy clusters. The ICL, a diffuse component of stars not bound to individual galaxies, serves as a key tracer of cluster formation and evolution. Using two hydrodynamics implementations, Gadget-X and Gizmo-Simba, we identify the stellar particles comprising the ICL at z=0 and trace them back in time to the moments when they were formed and accreted into the ICL. Across our 324 clusters, half of the present-day ICL mass is typically in place between $z \sim $ 0.2 and 0.5. The main ICL formation channel is the stripping of stars from subhalos after their infall into the host cluster. Within this channel, 65-80 per cent of the ICL comes from objects with stellar (infall) masses above $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, i.e., massive galaxies, groups and clusters. Considering the ratio of the infalling halo to the total cluster mass, a median of 35 per cent of the mass is brought in major merger events, though this percentage varies significantly across clusters (15-55 per cent). Additional contributions come from minor mergers (25-35 per cent) and smooth accretion (20-50 per cent). The primary contributors typically infall at $z \leq 1$, with smaller fractions arriving at redshifts between 1 and 2. Regarding other formation channels, we find minor contributions from stars formed in subhalos after their infall and stars stripped while their contributing halo remains outside the host cluster (and can eventually fall inside or stay outside). Finally, for our two sets of simulations, we find medians of 12 (Gadget-X) and 2 (Gizmo-Simba) per cent of the ICL mass formed in-situ, that is, directly as part of the diffuse component. However, this component can be attributed to stripping of gas in high-velocity infalling satellite galaxies.",
New submissions,Cosmic inventory of the background fields of relativistic particles in the Universe,Jonathan Biteau,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The extragalactic background is composed of the emission from all astrophysical sources, both resolved and unresolved, in addition to any diffuse components. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with stellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled by the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the extragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using observatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth orbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate data is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that contribute to the extragalactic background.In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most comprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background spectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27 frequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most extragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We explore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of relativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star formation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating these cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions of extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the extragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV to sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in the electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the origin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.",
New submissions,Star-forming galaxies in the cosmic web in the last 11 Gyr,"B. Jego,K. Kraljic,M. Béthermin,R. Davé",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We investigate how the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their position within the cosmic web using the SIMBA cosmological simulation from redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$. While previous studies found that galaxies closer to filaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether these trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy population mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies, robustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas depletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the cosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton using DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament. After removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate (SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions as a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent modulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion, reflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend in the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances ($\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores, suggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are not driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at low redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity modulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas supply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms dominating across cosmic time.",
New submissions,DESI Strong Lens Foundry IV: Spectroscopic Confirmation of DESI Lens Candidates with VLT/MUSE,"Emerald Lin,Ivonne Toro Bertolla,Aleksandar Cikota,Xiaosheng Huang,Christopher J. Storfer,Marcos Tamargo-Arizmendi,David J.

These observations are part of an ongoing effort to build a large, spectroscopically confirmed sample of strong lensing systems for studies on dark matter, galaxy structure, and cosmology. Our MUSE program targets both lens and source redshifts, with particular emphasis on southern hemisphere systems. MUSE's wide spectral coverage and integral field capability allow for efficient identification of multiple sources, lens environments, and weak spectral features. Redshifts for lenses and sources were obtained via manual identification of spectral features in extracted 1D spectra. Our dataset includes systems with complex configurations, such as multiple source planes and group or cluster-scale environments. We extracted and analyzed 185 spectra, successfully determining both the lens and the source redshifts for 48 gravitational lens systems. For an additional 21 targets, we measured the redshifts of the lenses but were unable to determine the redshifts of the background sources. Six targets were confirmed to not be gravitational lenses. The results presented here complement space-based imaging from our HST SNAPshot program and spectroscopic follow-up with DESI and Keck, and have lasting legacy value for identifying interesting high-redshift sources and complex lensing configurations.",

Cross submissions,Light thermal dark matter models in the light of DAMIC-M 2025 constraints,"Debasish Borah,Satyabrata Mahapatra,Narendra Sahu,Vicky Singh Thounaojam",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"We study the viability of light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV mass range in view of the stringent new DAMIC-M limits on DM-electron scattering. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM charged under a new Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)$, we outline two possibilities: (i) family non-universal $U(1)$ gauge coupling with resonantly enhanced DM annihilation into standard model (SM) fermions and (ii) family universal dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry where relic is set by DM annihilation into light gauge bosons. As an illustrative example of the first class of models, we consider a gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ extension of the SM having interesting detection prospects at several experiments. While both of these class of models lead to observed DM relic and consistency with DAMIC-M together with other experimental limits, the second class of models also lead to strong DM self-interactions, potentially solving the small-scale structure issues of cold dark matter. While a vast part of the parameter space in both the models is already ruled out, the current allowed region of parameter space can be further probed at ongoing or future experiments keeping the models testable.",
Cross submissions,"Ghost-free, gauge invariant SVT generalizations of Horndeski theory","S. Mironov,A. Shtennikova,M. Valencia-Villegas",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a new type of Scalar-Vector-Tensor (SVT) theories with higher derivatives of all the fields in the action, but with second order equations of motion. The higher derivative vector field is invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation and the Scalar-Tensor sector corresponds to Horndeski theory. We also present a subclass of these SVT theories with 8 free functions of $\pi$ and $X$ where the speed of the tensor and vector modes is exactly the same. In particular, the Horndeski functions $G_4(\pi,X)$ and $G_5(\pi)$ remain free, while the speed of the vector modes tracks the speed of the tensor modes. Additionally, the vector sector retains freedom through the four new functions. All the theories here shown are a generalization of the Kaluza-Klein reduction of 5D Horndeski theory, sharing the main properties in cosmology, but including new free scalar functions in the Lagrangian.",

We find strong evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, with deviations from $\Lambda$CDM favoring dynamical dark energy consistent with the Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 > -1$, $\omega_a < 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a < -1$). We also derive upper bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ from CMB + DESI DR2. For $\Lambda$CDM we find $\sum m_\nu < 0.066~\text{eV}$, while for $\omega$CDM it is $\sum m_\nu < 0.075~\text{eV}$. In o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM the limits are $\sum m_\nu < 0.263~\text{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu < 0.520~\text{eV}$, respectively. For other models, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE, the upper limits range from $< 0.043~\text{eV}$ to $< 0.127~\text{eV}$. Constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, remain consistent with the standard value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ for all models. Bayesian evidence shows that combining DES-SN5Y and Union3 SNe Ia with CMB + DESI DR2 reveals deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, while no model reaches the $5\sigma$ threshold, some show $> 3\sigma$ tensions with DES-SN5YR or Union3, hinting at cracks in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.",
Cross submissions,Multifield Cosmology and the Dark Universe,Lilia Anguelova,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Multifield models, arising from multiple scalars interacting with gravity, provide a rich theoretical framework for addressing fundamental problems in modern cosmology. A key role in this regard is played by the so called rapid turn regime, which is characterized by background solutions with strongly non-geodesic field-space trajectories. We review the implications of this regime for a number of problems relevant for cosmological inflation, dark matter and dark energy. We focus, in more detail, on a class of exact rapid-turn solutions that give a model of dynamical dark energy. In this model, the sound speed of the dark energy perturbations is reduced compared to the speed of light, which leads to observational differences from a cosmological constant even for an equation-of-state parameter very close to -1. Furthermore, this model holds promise for the simultaneous alleviation of two prominent cosmological tensions.",
Cross submissions,"Gravitational baryogenesis in $f(T,L_m)$ gravity","Daniel F.P. Cruz,David S. Pereira,Francisco S.N. Lobo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.",
