New submissions,Emulating Dark Matter Halo Merger Trees with Graph Generative Models,"Tri Nguyen,Chirag Modi,Siddharth Mishra-Sharma,L. Y. Aaron Yung,Rachel S. Somerville",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Merger trees track the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos across cosmic time and serve as essential inputs for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on ad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information. Nguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent neural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of merger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as FLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph structures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on merger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body simulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees with both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced using the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree accurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass and redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate its utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated trees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass relation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly from the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method for generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body simulations.",
New submissions,Absolute Calibration of Cluster Mira Variables to Provide a New Anchor for the Hubble Constant Determination,"Anupam Bhardwaj,Noriyuki Matsunaga,Caroline D. Huang,Adam G. Riess,Marina Rejkuba",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"Mira variables in globular clusters can provide an accurate and precise absolute calibration of their period-luminosity relations (PLRs) to independently anchor the cosmic distance scale and determine the Hubble constant. We present homogeneous near-infrared ($JHK_s$) time-series photometric observations of a sample of 55 candidate long-period variables in 18 globular clusters covering a wide metallicity range ($-1.7 < \textrm{[Fe/H]} < -0.1$ dex). The Gaia proper motions, long-period variability information, and optical-infrared colors are used to identify 41 Oxygen-rich Miras as members of the globular clusters. Mean luminosities of Miras in the $JHK_s$ bands are independently calibrated using the recommended distances and mean parallaxes to their host clusters. Cluster Mira PLRs exhibit scatter comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) variables and do not show any dependence on iron-abundance for a wide range of metallicities. We establish the accuracy of cluster Miras as independent anchors by determining a distance modulus to the LMC, $18.45 \pm 0.04$ mag, in agreement with the 1.2\% precise geometric distance. Our $H$-band photometry is transformed to derive {\it Hubble Space Telescope} F160W PLR for cluster Miras providing a three-anchor baseline with the LMC and NGC 4258. We employ three-anchor solution to determine distances to two type Ia supernovae host galaxies, NGC 1559 ($31.39\pm0.05$ mag) and M101 ($29.07\pm0.04$ mag), and provide a $3.7\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 73.06\pm 2.67$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Similar to Cepheids, our independent baseline solution results in a local $H_0$ determination that is systematically larger than its inference from the early universe probes, further supporting the ongoing Hubble tension.",
New submissions,The Discovery of Little Red Dots in the Local Universe: Signatures of Cool Gas Envelopes,"Xiaojing Lin,Xiaohui Fan,Zheng Cai,Fuyan Bian,Hanpu Liu,Fengwu Sun,Yilun Ma,Jenny E.

We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1-0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$\alpha$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed ""The Egg""), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, Fe II, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.",
New submissions,A Simulation Based Inference Approach to the Dynamics of the MW-LMC System -- Validation,"Richard A. N. Brooks,Jason L. Sanders,Adam M. Dillamore,Nicolás Garavito-Camargo,Adrian M. Price-Whelan",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has generated dynamical disequilibrium throughout the MW. The interaction has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an apparent 'reflex motion' in velocities of outer halo stars. Often, expensive high fidelity MW--LMC simulations are required to model these effects, though the range of model parameter spaces can be large and complex. We investigate the ability of lower fidelity, rigid MW-LMC simulations to reliably infer the model parameters of higher fidelity N-body and hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in MW--LMC simulations using a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) approach. We produce and release a set of 128,000 MW--LMC rigid potentials, with stellar haloes evolved to present-day, each adopting a unique combination of model parameters including the MW mass, the LMC mass and the dynamical friction strength. For these simulation parameters, we use SBI to find their posterior distributions. We find that our SBI framework trained on rigid MW--LMC simulations is able to correctly infer the true simulation LMC mass within a $1\sigma$ confidence interval from both N-body and cosmological simulations when knowledge of the induced MW reflex motion is provided as data. This motivates future applications of the presented SBI framework to observational data, which will help constrain both MW and LMC properties, as well as the dynamics of the MW's reflex motion.",
New submissions,"CHEX-MATE: Cluster Multi-Probes in Three Dimensions (CLUMP-3D) II. Combined Gas and Dark Matter Analysis from X-ray, SZE, and WL","Adriana Gavidia,Junhan Kim,Jack Sayers,Mauro Sereno,Loris Chappuis,Dominique Eckert,Keiichi Umetsu,Herve Bourdin,Federico De Luca,Stefano Ettori,Massimo Gaspari,Raphael Gavazzi,Scott Kay,Lorenzo Lovisari,Pasquale Mazzotta,Gabriel Pratt,Elena Rasia,Mariachiara Rossetti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Under the standard model of hierarchical structure formation, the overall geometry of galaxy clusters is better described by a triaxial ellipse than a sphere. As a result, applying spherically-symmetric models can result in significant biases. These biases can be mitigated by fitting a triaxial model, requiring deep multiprobe data and a set of physically motivated models to describe them. Here we present a multiprobe triaxial analysis methodology based on the data available for galaxy clusters in the Cluster Heritage project with XMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at Endpoint of structure formation (CHEX-MATE), which includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, SZ data from Planck and ACT, and WL data from Subaru. This work builds on our previous development of a gas-only X-ray and SZ triaxial fitting formalism in Paper I. We apply our approach to the CHEX-MATE cluster PSZ2 G313.33+61.13 (Abell 1689) and find that it is elongated along the line of sight relative to the plane of sky by a factor of $\mathcal{R}_{LP} = 1.27 \pm 0.02$. As a result, the WL mass obtained from our triaxial fit, $\text{M}_{200c}=(13.69_{-1.41}^{+1.56})\times10^{14} \text{M}_{\odot}$, is significantly lower than the value of $(17.77_{-1.75}^{+2.00})\times10^{14} \text{M}_{\odot}$ obtained from a spherically-symmetric fit that otherwise employs the same methodology. Our triaxial fit finds a concentration of $c_{200c}=8.55_{-1.61}^{+2.20}$, consistent with the spherically-symmetric value of $9.99_{-1.78}^{+2.26}$, which suggests that the unexpectedly high concentration in Abell 1689 is not due to triaxiality and orientation. We also measure the non-thermal pressure fraction at radii between 0.18-1.37 Mpc, finding a minimum of approximately 20 per cent at intermediate radii increasing to near 30 per cent at both the smallest and largest radii, and with a typical measurement precision of $\pm$5 per cent.",
New submissions,LATIS: A Sample of IGM-selected Protoclusters and Protogroups at $z \sim 2.5$,"Andrew B. Newman,Mahdi Qezlou,Gwen C. Rudie,Nima Chartab,Guillermo A. Blanc,Daniel D. Kelson,Simeon Bird,Caitlin Casey,Enrico Congiu,Olga Cucciati,Denise Hung,Brian C. Lemaux,Victoria Pérez,Jorge Zavala",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS) has produced large 3D maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM), providing a new window on the cosmic web at $z\sim2.5$. A key advantage of Ly$\alpha$ tomography is that it enables the discovery of overdense regions without the need to detect their galaxy members in spectroscopic surveys, circumventing possible selection biases. We use these maps to identify 37 IGM-selected overdensities as regions of strong and spatially coherent Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Simulations indicate that 85% of these are protoclusters, defined as the progenitors of $z=0$ halos with mass $M_{\rm desc} > 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, and that nearly all of the rest are protogroups ($10^{13.5} < M_{\rm desc} / M_{\odot} < 10^{14}$). We estimate the masses and space densities of the IGM-selected overdensities and show they are in accordance with mock surveys. We investigate the LATIS counterparts of some previously reported protoclusters, including the proto-supercluster Hyperion. We identify a new component of Hyperion beyond its previously known extent. We show that the Ly$\alpha$ transmission of the galaxy density peaks within Hyperion is consistent with a simple physical model (the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation), suggesting that active galactic nucleus feedback or other processes have not affected the large-scale gas ionization within this structure as whole. The LATIS catalog represents an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of IGM-selected protogroups and protoclusters and will enable new investigations of the connections between galaxies and their large-scale environments at cosmic noon.",
New submissions,LATIS: Comparing Galaxy and IGM Tomography Maps as Tracers of Large-scale Structure and Protoclusters at $z \sim 2.5$,"Andrew B. Newman,Nima Chartab,Mahdi Qezlou,Gwen C. Rudie,Guillermo A. Blanc,Daniel D. Kelson,Simeon Bird,Caitlin Casey,Enrico Congiu,Olga Cucciati,Denise Hung,Brian C. Lemaux,Victoria Pérez,Jorge Zavala",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the consistency of intergalactic medium (IGM) tomography and galaxy surveys as tracers of the cosmic web and protoclusters at $z \sim 2.5$. We use maps from the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which trace the distributions of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and IGM Ly$\alpha$ absorption on $\simeq 4$ $h^{-1}$ cMpc scales within the same large volume. Overall, the joint distribution of IGM absorption and LBG density is well constrained and accurately described by a simple physical model. However, we identify several exceptional locations exhibiting strong IGM absorption indicative of a massive protocluster, yet no coincident overdensity of LBGs. As discussed by Newman et al., whose results we revise using the complete LATIS survey data, these are candidate ultraviolet (UV)-dim protoclusters that may harbor distinct galaxy populations missed by rest-UV spectroscopic surveys. We present follow-up observations targeting one such candidate embedded within Antu, an extended region of IGM absorption at $z=2.685$ that contains five IGM-selected protoclusters and has a total mass of $3 \times 10^{15}~M_{\odot}$. Ly$\alpha$ emitters trace the overall structure of Antu but avoid the center of the candidate UV-dim protocluster, which also appears to contain no submillimeter-selected sources. A near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy census is needed to determine whether this large region is dominated by galaxies with reduced or absent star-formation activity. This work adds to a growing and puzzling literature on discrepancies among different galaxy and IGM tracers, whose resolution promises to shed light on the early stages of environment-dependent galaxy evolution.",
New submissions,Testing Planck 2020 and DESI data on wCDM Models,Kathleen Sammut,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H_0} and {\sigma_8} by using the latest observational data. This research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and BAO data by comparing them to their predecessors. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers (CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe. This study also showed that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones, while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model over the dynamical dark energy models",

Quasar catalogues from narrow-band photometric data are used in a variety of applications, including targeting for spectroscopic follow-up, measurements of supermassive black hole masses, or Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Here, we present the final quasar catalogue, including redshift estimates, from the miniJPAS Data Release constructed using several flavours of machine-learning algorithms. Methods. In this work, we use a machine learning algorithm to classify quasars, optimally combining the output of 8 individual algorithms. We assess the relative importance of the different classifiers. We include results from 3 different redshift estimators to also provide improved photometric redshifts. We compare our final catalogue against both simulated data and real spectroscopic data. Our main comparison metric is the $f_1$ score, which balances the catalogue purity and completeness. Results. We evaluate the performance of the combined algorithm using synthetic data. In this scenario, the combined algorithm outperforms the rest of the codes, reaching $f_1=0.88$ and $f_1=0.79$ for high- and low-z quasars (with $z\geq2.1$ and $z<2.1$, respectively) down to magnitude $r=23.5$. We further evaluate its performance against real spectroscopic data, finding different performances. We conclude that our simulated data is not realistic enough and that a new version of the mocks would improve the performance. Our redshift estimates on mocks suggest a typical uncertainty of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} =0.11$, which, according to our results with real data, could be significantly smaller (as low as $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}=0.02$). We note that the data sample is still not large enough for a full statistical consideration.",
New submissions,The Shape of Dark Energy: Constraining Its Evolution with a General Parametrization,"Dong Ha Lee,Weiqiang Yang,Eleonora Di Valentino,Supriya Pan,Carsten van de Bruck",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider a general dark energy (DE) model parametrized by its equation-of-state (EoS), featuring three free parameters: $w_0$ (the present-day value of the DE EoS), $w_{\beta}$ (quantifying the dynamical nature of the DE EoS), and $\beta$ (governing various dynamical forms of the DE EoS). The key controlling parameter $\beta$ can recover several existing DE models in the literature, such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization ($\beta = 1$), the logarithmic parametrization (in the limit $\beta \rightarrow 0$), and the linear parametrization ($\beta = -1$), alongside generate a class of new DE parametrizations for other values of $\beta$. The resulting DE scenario is constrained using a suite of the latest cosmological probes, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies from three different experiments (Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope combined with WMAP), CMB lensing, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI Year 2, and PantheonPlus from Type Ia supernovae. Our analyses reveal that stringent constraints on the DE parameters are obtained only when all cosmological probes are combined; otherwise, some parameters remain unconstrained. The present-day value of the DE EoS remains in the quintessence regime according to our results, and no significant evidence for a dynamical DE EoS is found. However, based on the $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence analyses, we observe a mild preference for the present three-parameter DE parametrization over the CPL parametrization when all cosmological probes are taken into account. Nonetheless, the Bayesian evidence difference remains below the threshold for statistical significance according to the revised Jeffreys scale, indicating that both models are effectively equally preferred by the data.",
New submissions,From Redshift to Real Space: Combining Linear Theory With Neural Networks,"Edoardo Maragliano,Punyakoti Ganeshaiah Veena,Giulia Degni,Enzo Franco Branchini",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Spectroscopic redshift surveys are key tools to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe and test the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, using redshifts as distance proxies introduces distortions in the 3D galaxy distribution. If uncorrected, these distortions lead to systematic errors in LSS analyses and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a new method that combines linear theory (LT) and a neural network (NN) to mitigate redshift space distortions (RSDs). The hybrid LT+NN approach is trained and validated on dark matter halo fields from z = 1 snapshots of the Quijote N-body simulations. LT corrects large-scale distortions in the linear regime, while the NN learns quasi-linear and small-scale features. The LT correction is applied first, then the NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales. The method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant performance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN alone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger correlations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately. The hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and halo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to NN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and quasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation functions. This work shows that combining a physically motivated dynamical model with a machine learning algorithm leverages the strengths of both approaches. The LT+NN method achieves high accuracy with modest training data and computational cost, making it a promising tool for future applications to more realistic galaxy surveys.",
New submissions,Revisiting Cosmic Distance Duality with Megamasers and DESI DR2: Model Independent Constraints on Early-Late Calibration,"Brijesh Kanodia,Ujjwal Upadhyay,Yashi Tiwari",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) connects the angular diameter distance ($d_A$) and the luminosity distance ($d_L$) at a given redshift. This fundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that photon number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A deviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low redshifts ($z < 0.04$) by combining $d_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project with $d_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). We find the relation to be statistically consistent with the current data. We further incorporate high-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)-based $d_A$ measurements from DESI DR2 in combination with SNIa data, highlighting the critical role of the $r_d-M_b$ (early-late) calibration in testing the CDDR using these two probes. Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to derive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only BAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r_d$ and $M_b$. However, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this degeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific cosmological model or distance-ladder techniques. Additionally, we present a forecast incorporating the expected precision from future Megamaser and SNIa observations, demonstrating their potential to significantly tighten constraints on early-late calibration parameters, under the assumption of validity of CDDR.",

In this uniquely data-rich regime, we take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building a library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and redshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame colour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate -- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with zero, across low (0.05<z<0.5) and high (0.8<z<1.55) redshifts. In order to construct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain maximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment with colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the amplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated with stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between 0<z<1.5, trends in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments we measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion paper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA signals with significant detections, including model comparison. Finally, to direct efforts for future IA measurements, we juxtapose the colour-magnitude-redshift coverage of existing IA measurements against modern and future lensing surveys.",

Cross submissions,Asymgenesis,"Martin A. Mojahed,Sascha Weber",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a framework based on the standard type-I seesaw model that relates the baryon asymmetry of the universe to the dark matter (DM) density. The framework, which we name ""Asymgenesis"", relies on the presence of primordial charge asymmetries seeded either in the dark sector or in the visible sector. A higher-dimensional portal operator reshuffles this initial asymmetry into both sectors, eventually resulting in a nonzero $B-L$ asymmetry and an asymmetric DM component. Compared to conventional asymmetric-dark-matter (ADM) schemes, our framework imposes far milder requirements on the portal interaction. In particular, the portal interaction need not violate $B-L$, and the temperature scales of efficient $B-L$ violation and efficient charge-transfer interaction mediated by the portal operator can be separated. We develop the formalism in detail and argue that the flexibility of our framework enlarges the model-building landscape for ADM.",
Cross submissions,Probing Non-Minimal Dark Sectors via the 21 cm Line at Cosmic Dawn,"Federico Cima,Francesco D'Eramo",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Observations of the hydrogen hyperfine transition through the 21 cm line near the end of the cosmic dark ages provide unique opportunities to probe new physics. In this work, we investigate the potential of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal to constrain metastable particles produced in the early universe that decay at later times, thereby modifying the thermal and ionization history of the intergalactic medium. The study begins by extending previous analyses of decaying dark matter (DM), incorporating back-reaction effects and tightening photon decay constraints down to DM masses as low as 20.4 eV. The focus then shifts to non-minimal dark sectors with multiple interacting components. The analysis covers two key scenarios: a hybrid setup comprising a stable cold DM component alongside a metastable sub-component, and a two-component dark sector of nearly degenerate states with a metastable heavier partner. A general parameterization based on effective mass spectra and fractional densities allows for a model-independent study. The final part presents two explicit realizations: an axion-like particle coupled to photons, and pseudo-Dirac DM interacting via vector portals or electromagnetic dipoles. These scenarios illustrate how 21 cm cosmology can set leading bounds and probe otherwise inaccessible regions of parameter space.",
Cross submissions,"GeV-scale thermal dark matter from dark photons: tightly constrained, yet allowed","D. Alonso-González,D. Cerdeño,P. Foldenauer,J. M. No",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"GeV-scale thermal dark matter (DM) is highly constrained by the null results of both direct and indirect detection experiments, especially in the context of simplified models. In this work, we study the interplay of collider, direct and indirect detection constraints on an extension of the dark Abelian Higgs model that includes a Dirac fermionic DM candidate, $\chi$. We take into account in a consistent fashion the dilution of the indirect and direct detection signals when the relic abundance of $\chi$ is smaller than the total observed DM density (assuming that it is a subdominant component in those cases). As a consequence, we show that indirect detection constraints cannot probe regions with large kinetic mixing, and direct detection experiments provide the leading constraints in most of the parameter space. Collider searches for the (invisibly decaying) vector mediator provide complementary bounds in areas with large kinetic mixing. We find that the only way to avoid both indirect and direct detection limits is in narrow windows of parameter space close to $m_\chi\lesssim m_{Z_D}/2$, when $\chi$ is produced resonantly in the early universe, and it can constitute all of the DM. For this to happen, a small dark sector coupling is required: $\alpha_D~\lesssim10^{-3}$ for DM masses below $6$ GeV, or $\alpha_D~\lesssim10^{-5}$ for DM masses larger than $10$ GeV. The remaining areas of the parameter space can be probed in a complementary way by future direct detection experiments (which will narrow down the allowed area around the resonant region) and collider searches (which will set limits for smaller values of the kinetic mixing).",
