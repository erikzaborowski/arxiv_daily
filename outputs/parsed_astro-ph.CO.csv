New submissions,The Effects of Linear Matter Power Spectrum Enhancement on Dark Matter Substructure,"Ethan O. Nadler,Vera Gluscevic,Andrew Benson",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way (MW) analog originating from enhanced linear matter power spectra $P(k)$ relative to the standard cold, collisionless DM (CDM) cosmology. We consider a Gaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this behavior could arise from early-universe physics that alters the primordial matter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find that enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in substructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF) resulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high masses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is sensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the SHMF enhancement depend on the wave number of the $P(k)$ excess and the presence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the SHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution. Additionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center and their concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Thus, nonlinear mode coupling must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using DM substructure.",
New submissions,Strong scale-dependence does not enhance the kinematic boosting of gravitational wave backgrounds,"Giorgio Mentasti,Carlo R. Contaldi,Marco Peloso",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Existing expressions in the literature appear to indicate that Doppler boosting, due to our proper motion with respect to the isotropic frame of the universe, can amplify stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds whose energy spectra exhibit strong scale dependence, for example, those generated by large scalar perturbations in models of primordial black holes or by astrophysical populations with broken power-law behaviour. It has been suggested that this enhancement could increase the signal-to-noise ratio of such backgrounds in pulsar timing measurements, as well as in ground- and space-based observatories. We show that the reported enhancement is an artefact of a Taylor expansion of the boosted signal, typically performed in the literature under the assumption of a small boosting parameter. This approximation fails to reproduce the correct result for signals with strong scale dependence. When Doppler boosting is treated exactly, the apparent amplification disappears. Using representative spectra, we demonstrate that Doppler motion induces only blue- and red-shifting by the expected amount; it does not lead to additional amplification or introduce new spectral features. The exact expression for the kinematic boost can and should be easily applied in analysing such backgrounds.",
New submissions,"A unified spin-harmonic framework for correlating pulsar timing, astrometric deflection, and shimmering gravitational wave observations","Giorgio Mentasti,Carlo R. Contaldi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a unified spin-weighted harmonic framework that delivers analytic, diagonal expressions for the overlap (correlation) functions of three low frequency gravitational wave observables-pulsar timing redshifts, astrometric deflections, and time-dependent image distortions (``shimmering''). Writing each response in spin-$s$ spherical harmonics and rotating to a basis in which the wave tensor has definite helicity, we obtain compact closed-form series for every auto- and cross-correlation, recovering the Hellings-Downs curve as the $s=0$ limit and deriving its astrometric ($s=\pm 1$) and shimmering ($s=\pm 2$) analogues. The formalism naturally extends to non-standard scalar-breathing, longitudinal, and vector polarisation modes, clarifying when higher-spin observables are (and are not) sourced and providing a complete set of harmonic spectra $C_\ell$ ready for parameter estimation pipelines. These results supply the common theoretical language needed to combine upcoming pulsar timing, Gaia-class astrometric, and high resolution imaging data sets, enabling coherent, multi probe searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, tests of general relativity and its alternatives across the nano- to micro-hertz gravitational wave band.",
New submissions,ALMA survey of a massive node of the Cosmic Web at $z\sim 3$. II. A dynamically cold and massive disk galaxy in the proximity of a hyperluminous quasar,"A. Pensabene,S. Cantalupo,W. Wang,C. Bacchini,F. Fraternali,M. Bischetti,C. Cicone,R. Decarli,G. Pezzulli,M. Galbiati,T. Lazeyras,N. Ledos,G. Quadri,A. Travascio",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of early massive galaxies and black holes requires detailed studies of dense structures in the high-redshift Universe. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\simeq0.3''$) ALMA observations targeting the CO(4--3) line and the underlying 3-mm dust continuum toward the Cosmic Web node MQN01, a region identified through deep multiwavelength surveys as one of the densest concentrations of galaxies and AGN at cosmic noon. At the center of this structure, we identify a massive, rotationally supported disk galaxy located approximately at $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ projected-distance and $\sim-300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ from a hyperluminous quasar at $z=3.2510$. By accurately modeling the cold gas kinematics, we determine a galaxy dynamical mass of $2.5\times10^{11}\,{M_{\odot}}$ within the inner $\simeq 4\,{\rm kpc}$, and a high degree of rotational support of $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 11$. This makes it the first quasar companion galaxy confirmed as a massive, dynamically cold rotating disk at such an early cosmic epoch. Despite the small projected separation from the quasar host, we find no clear evidence of strong tidal interactions affecting the galaxy disk. This might suggest that the quasar is a satellite galaxy in the early stages of a merger. Furthermore, our spectroscopic analysis reveals a broad, blueshifted component in the CO(4--3) line profile of the quasar host, which may trace a powerful molecular outflow or kinematic disturbances induced by its interaction with the massive companion galaxy. Our findings show that rotationally supported cold disks are able to survive even in high-density environments of the early Universe.",
New submissions,Exploring the Masses of the Two Most Distant Gravitational Lensing Clusters at the Cosmic Noon,"Jinhyub Kim,M. James Jee,Stefano Andreon,Tony Mroczkowski,Lance Miller,Joshiwa van Marrewijk,Hye Gyeong Khim",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Observations over the past decade have shown that galaxy clusters undergo the most transformative changes during the $z = 1.5 - 2$ epoch. However, challenges such as low lensing efficiency, high shape measurement uncertainty, and a scarcity of background galaxies have prevented us from characterizing their masses with weak gravitational lensing (WL) beyond the redshift $z\sim1.75$. In this paper, we report the successful WL detection of JKCS 041 and XLSSC 122 at $z=1.80$ and $z=1.98$, respectively, utilizing deep infrared imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope with careful removal of instrumental effects. These are the most distant clusters ever measured through WL. The mass peaks of JKCS 041 and XLSSC 122, which coincide with the X-ray peak positions of the respective clusters, are detected at the $\sim3.7\sigma$ and $\sim3.2\sigma$ levels, respectively. Assuming a single spherical Navarro-Frenk-White profile, we estimate that JKCS 041 has a virial mass of $M_{200c} = (5.4\pm1.6) \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ while the mass of XLSSC 122 is determined to be $M_{200c} = (3.3\pm1.8) \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$. These WL masses are consistent with the estimates inferred from their X-ray observations. We conclude that although the probability of finding such massive clusters at their redshifts is certainly low, their masses can still be accommodated within the current $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.",
New submissions,Tidal adaptive softening and artificial fragmentation in cosmological simulations,"Robert A. Mostoghiu Paun,Darren Croton,Chris Power,Alexander Knebe,Adam J. Ussing,Alan R. Duffy",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Traditional N-body methods introduce localised perturbations in the gravitational forces governing their evolution. These perturbations lead to an artificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale Structure, often referred to as ""beads-on-a-string."" This issue is particularly apparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at small spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations induced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the suppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown to minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we investigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for dark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the severity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly improves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a fixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious haloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial conditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo formation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening counterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore, initialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in z=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This sphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying spurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology. We propose potential strategies for reducing spurious haloes without abandoning current N-body methods.",
New submissions,Bye binormal: analysing the joint PDF of galaxy density and weak lensing convergence,"Oliver Friedrich,Lina Castiblanco,Anik Halder,Cora Uhlemann",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"At any given scale, 3$\times$2-point statistics extract only three numbers from the joint distribution of the cosmic matter density and galaxy density fluctuations: their variances and their covariance. It is well known that the full shape of the PDF of those fluctuations contains significantly more information than can be accessed through these three numbers. But the study of the PDF of cosmic density fluctuations in real observational data is still in its infancy. Here we present \verb|CosMomentum|, a public software toolkit for calculating theoretical predictions for the full shape of the joint distribution of a line-of-sight projected tracer density and the gravitational lensing convergence. We demonstrate that an analysis of this full shape of the PDF can indeed disentangle complicated tracer bias and stochasticity relations from signatures of cosmic structure growth. Our paper also provides back-drop for an upcoming follow-up study, which prepares PDF analyses for application to observational data by incorporating the impact of realistic weak lensing systematics.",
New submissions,Monodromic Dark Energy and DESI,"Samuel Goldstein,Marco Celoria,Fabian Schmidt",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed interest in dynamical dark energy models, particularly those that cross the ""phantom divide"" ($w_{\rm DE} = -1$). We present the first observational constraints on monodromic k-essence, a physically motivated scalar field dark energy scenario capable of realizing rapid oscillations about the phantom divide. Using cosmic microwave background (CMB) information, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and Type Ia supernovae observations, we constrain the amplitude, frequency, phase, and power-law index describing the monodromic k-essence scenario at the background level. We find that the monodromic dark energy scenario can fit these datasets with a $\chi^2$ that is comparable to the phenomenological $w_0$-$w_a$ parametrization. While the CMB and BAO data alone are consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the inclusion of DESY5 supernovae shows a preference for a non-zero amplitude, $A=0.44^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ (fully marginalized 68% C.L.). Conversely, inclusion of the Pantheon-Plus supernovae provides no evidence for monodromic k-essence, with $A<0.43$ (95% C.L.). We show that constraints on both monodromic dark energy and $w_0$-$w_a$ models are sensitive to the DESI DR2 LRG2 BAO distance, especially in the absence of supernovae data.",
New submissions,Quantifying the Impact of 2D and 3D BAO Measurements on the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation with HII Galaxy observation,"Jie Zheng(HNAS),Da-Chun Qiang(HNAS),Zhi-Qiang You(HNAS),Darshan Kumar(HNAS)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) is a fundamental and practical condition in observational cosmology that connects the luminosity distance and angular diameter distance. Testing its validity offers a powerful tool to probe new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, for the first time, we present a novel consistency test of CDDR by combining HII galaxy data with a comprehensive set of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. The BAO measurements include two-dimensional (2D) BAO and three-dimensional (3D) BAO, as well as the latest 3D BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). We adopt four different parameterizations of the CDDR parameter, $\eta(z)$, to investigate possible deviations and their evolution with cosmic time. To ensure accurate redshift matching across datasets, we reconstruct the distance measures through a model-independent Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. Our analysis uniquely examines two distinct approaches: $i)$ marginalization over the BAO sound horizon $r_d$, and $ii)$ fixing $r_d$ to specific values. We find no significant deviation from the CDDR (less than 68% confidence level) in either the marginalized $r_d$ or the $r_d=147.05$ Mpc scenario. However, a slight deviation at the 68% confidence level is found when applying 2D-BAO data with $r_d=139.5$ Mpc. Furthermore, our analysis shows that all BAO data considered in this work support the validity of the CDDR, where 3D-DESI BAO provides the tightest constraints. We find no tension between 2D and 3D BAO measurements, which confirms their mutual consistency. In addition, the treatment of the sound horizon $r_d$ significantly impacts $\eta(z)$ constraints, which proves its importance in CDDR tests. Finally, the consistency of our results supports the standard CDDR and demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.",
New submissions,Tightening constraints on primordial oscillations with latest ACT and SPT data,"Ze-Yu Peng,Yun-Song Piao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The oscillation in primordial power spectrum (PPS), a fingerprint of not only a wide class of models of inflation but new physics, is of significant theoretical interest, and can be imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we present constraints on periodic oscillations in the PPS using the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1 CMB data with the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. It is found that the combination of SPT and ACT with Planck CMB dataset significantly tightens the upper bound to $A_\mathrm{log,lin}\lesssim 0.029$ at 95\% C.L., showing no hint for primordial oscillations, where $A_\mathrm{log,lin}$ are the amplitudes of logarithmic and linear oscillation in the PPS, respectively. Our work presents state-of-the-art CMB constraints on primordial oscillations, highlighting the power of the ground-based CMB experiments in constraining physics beyond the simplest slow-roll models.",
New submissions,Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $γ$-ray bursts,"Lu Feng,Tao Han,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} > 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.",
New submissions,CMB constraints on $U(1)$ axion warm inflation,"Asma Alaei,Sukannya Bhattacharya,Vahid Kamali",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this work, we propose a model of warm inflation driven by axion-like particles interacting with $U(1)$ gauge fields, with implications for the early universe's thermal evolution. By extending traditional warm inflation models, we introduce a dissipation mechanism through the thermal fluctuations of electromagnetic fields, leading to a non-trivial backreaction on the inflaton's dynamics. Our results are consistent with CMB observations, even for a natural sub-Plankian axion decay constant $f<M_{\rm Pl}$. We present precise constraints on the model's free parameters, using CAMB and CosmoMC codes. These findings offer new insights into the thermal history of the universe and the nature of inflationary dynamics.",
New submissions,GW231123: a product of successive mergers from $\sim 10 $ stellar-mass black holes,"Yin-Jie Li,Shan-Peng Tang,Ling-Qin Xue,Yi-Zhong Fan",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We analyze GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH mass and spin distributions to test possible formation scenarios: first-generation stellar collapse, hierarchical (multi-generation) mergers, and primordial origin. Our analysis strongly prefers scenarios where at least one component is a higher-generation BH. Both components are favored to have high spins, which rules out scenarios in which they are both first-generation (low spin) or primordial (nearly non-spin). We conclude that GW231123 is a hierarchical merger, with components plausibly originate from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical fraction in the disks of active galactic nucleus.",
New submissions,Inflationary Fossils Beyond Perturbation Theory,"Riccardo Impavido,Nicola Bartolo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we provide the missing link between two approaches aimed at characterizing the effect of long perturbation modes in Inflation. We consider the Inflationary Fossils' approach (arXiv:1203.0302and related works) that characterizes the power-spectrum of the inflaton field in presence of other long and non dynamical fossil fields, and a technique, appeared inarXiv:2103.09244, that computes, beyond perturbation theory, the power-spectrum of a scalar field in presence of a large fluctuation of a second field. We clarify a few points on the applicability of the non-perturbative technique. We prove in five distinct cases that the non-perturbative approach, once expanded to first order in the coupling, matches the perturbative result following the Fossils' approach. We believe that this non-perturbative technique extends to all orders the Fossils' approach, resumming infinitely many diagrams of standard in-in perturbation theory.",
New submissions,Estimating the baryon fraction in the IGM from well-localized FRBs and DESI data,Thais Lemos,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Current measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI DR2), when combined with data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), challenge the observational viability of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, motivating combinations of independent datasets to estimate cosmological quantities. In a previous communication, we presented a cosmological independent method to constrain the baryon fraction in the IGM ($f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$), where we derived relevant expressions for the dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}$) in terms of luminosity distance, allowing us to estimate $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ combining directly measurements of 17 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe from the Pantheon catalog. Here we revisit this method to constrain $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$, considering two parameterizations for the $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$: constant and time-dependent. We expand our sample by combining 107 well-localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with BAO measurements from DESI DR2 and SNe observations from DESY5, and the Pantheon+ catalog. We find through a Bayesian model selection analysis that a conclusive answer about the evolution of $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ cannot be achieved from the current FRBs observational data. In particular, our results show weak evidence in favor of the constant case.",
New submissions,Inflation from a generalized exponential plateau: towards extra suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratios,"Gerasimos Kouniatalis,Emmanuel N. Saridakis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a standard minimally-coupled scalar-field inflationary scenario, which is based on a new potential, with suitably generalized plateau features, that leads to extra small tensor-to-scalar ratios. In particular, we consider a specific three-parameter potential, which has a flatter plateau and a steeper well compared to the Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame. We study the inflationary realization and we show that it guarantees a prolonged period of slow-roll inflation and a successful exit. Additionally, the steeper minimum leads to significantly suppressed tensor perturbations, and thus to an extra-small tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and we show that we are able to obtain $r$ values less than $10^{-5}$. Moreover, we calculate the reheating temperature showing that in order to be in agreement with observations one of the potential parameters should remain within specific bounds. Finally, performing an inverse conformal transformation to the Jordan frame we show that the considered potential corresponds to higher-order corrections to Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame, and these corrections are the reason for the improved behavior of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.",
New submissions,Beyond the Dot: an LRD-like nucleus at the Heart of an IR-Bright Galaxy and its implications for high-redshift LRDs,"Pierluigi Rinaldi,George H. Rieke,Zihao Wu,Carys J. E.

Willmer,Yongda Zhu",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, red sources discovered by JWST at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$), marked by distinctive ""V-shaped"" spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their evolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is challenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed {\it the Saguaro}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS-North, as a possible analog of high-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path toward lower-redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus surrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1) its nuclear spectrum shows a clear ""V-shaped"" SED; and (2) when redshifted to $z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking an LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended hosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically selected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins reveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution. A simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can explain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that {\it the Saguaro} is not unique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\lesssim3.5$. Taken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a distinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a short-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red appearance driven largely by observational biases.",
New submissions,A first measurement of baryonic feedback with Fast Radio Bursts,"Robert Reischke,Steffen Hagstotz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Baryonic feedback fundamentally alters the total matter distribution on small to intermediate cosmological scales, posing a significant challenge for contemporary cosmological analyses. Direct tracers of the baryon distribution are therefore key for unearthing cosmological information buried under astrophysical effects. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a novel and direct probe of baryons, tracing the integrated ionised electron density along the line-of-sight, quantified by the dispersion measure (DM). The scatter of the DM as a function of redshift provides insight into the lumpiness of the electron distribution and, consequently, baryonic feedback processes. Using a model calibrated to the \texttt{BAHAMAS} hydrodynamical simulation suite, we forward-model the statistical properties of the DM with redshift. Applying this model to approximately 100 localised FRBs, we constrain the governing feedback parameter, $\log T_\mathrm{AGN}$. Our findings represent the first measurement of baryonic feedback using FRBs, demonstrating a strong rejection of no-feedback scenarios at greater than $99.7\,\%$ confidence ($3\sigma$), depending on the FRB sample. We find that FRBs prefer fairly strong feedback, similar to other measurements of the baryon distribution, via the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The results are robust against sightline correlations and modelling assumptions. We emphasise the importance of accurate calibration of the host galaxy and Milky Way contributions to the DM. Furthermore, we discuss implications for future FRB surveys and necessary improvements to current models to ensure accurate fitting of upcoming data, particularly that from low-redshift FRBs.",
New submissions,Direct correlation of line intensity mapping and CMB lensing from lightcone evolution,"Delon Shen,Nickolas Kokron,Emmanuel Schaan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Line intensity mapping (LIM) promises to probe previously inaccessible corners of the faint and high-redshift universe. However, confusion with bright foregrounds is a major challenge for current-era pathfinder LIM experiments. Cross-correlation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing is a promising avenue to enable the first LIM detections at high redshifts, a pristine probe of fundamental physics but sparsely populated by faint galaxies, and to further probe the connection between matter and spectral line emission, expanding our understanding of galaxies and the IGM. Previous works have suggested that this direct correlation between LIM and CMB lensing is effectively impossible because smoothly varying modes in the intensity map are lost to bright foregrounds. In this work, we analytically revisit the direct correlation of foreground-filtered line intensity mapping with CMB lensing, highlighting lightcone evolution's previously neglected yet unavoidable and crucial effects. Indeed, the growth of structure and evolution of line emission along the lightcone breaks statistical translational invariance and thus induces mode coupling, even in linear theory, which enables the recovery of the smoothly varying modes lost to bright foregrounds. We compute the effects of these lightcone evolution-induced mode couplings on the LIMxCMB lensing cross-spectrum detectability, predicting that future wider-sky versions of COMAP, CCAT, and HETDEX will be able to precisely measure this cross-correlation. Although we focus on the direct correlation of LIM with CMB lensing in this paper, our arguments generalize to the direct correlation of LIM with any projected field.",
Cross submissions,Fast and Fewrious: Stochastic binary perturbations from fast compact objects,"Badal Bhalla,Benjamin V. Lehmann,Kuver Sinha,Tao Xu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"Massive compact objects soften binaries. This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System. This opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to asteroid-mass DM candidates.",
Cross submissions,Connecting Early Dark Energy to Late Dark Energy by the Diluting Matter Potential,"Eduardo I. Guendelman,Ramon Herrera,Pedro Labrana",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work we study a scale invariant gravity theory containing two scalar fields, dust particles and a measure defined from degrees of freedom independent of the metric. The integration of the degrees of freedom that define the measure spontaneously break the scale symmetry, leaving us in the Einstein frame with an effective potential that is dependent on the density of the particles. The potential contains three flat regions, one for inflation, another for early dark energy and the third for late dark energy. At a certain point, as the matter dilutes, tunneling from the early dark energy to the late dark energy can start efficiently. This mechanism naturally alleviated the observed Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon prior to recombination while preserving late-time cosmology. Moreover, the model predictions are consistent with observations from the reduced CMB, BAO, and local measurement of $H_0$, providing a coherent and unified description of the universe. In this context, the Bayesian analysis of these datasets confirms the viability of our scenario, with the best-fit parameters indicating an early dark energy fraction of approximately 30$\%$ at a redshift of $z'=5000$.",
Cross submissions,Bispectrum of induced gravitational waves in the poltergeist mechanism,"Han-Wen Hu,Cheng-Jun Fang,Zhen-Min Zeng,Zong-Kuan Guo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In the poltergeist mechanism the enhancement of induced gravitational waves (GWs) occurs due to a sudden transition from an early matter-dominated era to the radiation-dominated era. In this work, we calculate the bispectrum of induced GWs from the poltergeist mechanism by adopting the sudden transition approximation. We find that the tensor bispectrum peaks either in the equilateral or squeezed configurations, depending on scales. Such a characteristic behavior enables us to distinguish it from that from other GW generation mechanisms.",
Cross submissions,Accelerated cosmological expansion from pseudo-Hermiticity,"Edmund J. Copeland,Andrei Lazanu,Peter Millington,Esra Sablevice",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We show that a well-studied pseudo-Hermitian field theory composed of two complex scalar fields can generate accelerated cosmological expansion through a novel mechanism. The dynamics is unique to the pseudo-Hermitian field theory, and it arises in the regime of broken antilinear symmetry, wherein a growth instability from the resulting complex eigenspectrum competes with the Hubble damping. The azimuthal components of the complex scalar fields asymptote to a constant rate of rolling at late times, reminiscent of motion around the infinite staircase of M.C. Escher's lithograph ""Ascending and Descending"". The resulting centripetal acceleration drives the radial components of the field away from the minimum of the potential, and the system generates a self-sustaining and constant Hubble rate at late times, even when tuning the minimum of the potential such that the classical vacuum energy is vanishing. This result evidences the potential to generate novel and physically relevant dynamics that are unique to pseudo-Hermitian field theories, and that their regimes of broken antilinear symmetry can be physically relevant in dynamical spacetimes.",
