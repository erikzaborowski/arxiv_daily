New submissions,The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Constraints on Local Non-Gaussianity from the ACT Cluster Catalog,"Leonid Sarieddine,J. Richard Bond,Matt Hilton,Raul Jimenez,Arthur Kosowsky,Kavilan Moodley,Bernardita Ried Guachalla,Cristóbal Sifón,Suzanne T. Staggs,Licia Verde,Edward J. Wollack",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We derive constraints on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity using the ACT DR6 Sunyaev--Zel'dovich cluster catalog. Modeling the redshift- and mass-dependent number counts of 1,201 clusters in the 10,347~deg$^2$ Legacy region, and accounting for survey completeness, intrinsic SZ scatter, and a weak-lensing-calibrated mass bias, we compute theoretical abundances using the Log--Edgeworth halo mass function. Assuming $\Lambda$CDM with well-motivated external priors, we obtain $f_{\rm NL} = 55 \pm 125$ (68% CL), consistent with Gaussian initial conditions. These constraints probe comoving scales of $5$--$10~{\rm Mpc}~h^{-1}$, complementing CMB bispectrum and scale-dependent bias measurements, which do not reach such small scales. We also find evidence for a 16.4% residual mass bias, which, although heavily informed by our adopted priors, plays a key role in matching observed and predicted counts but has negligible effect on $f_{\rm NL}$ constraints. We briefly discuss robustness of the results under relaxed priors and the prospects for next-generation SZ and lensing surveys to strengthen cluster-based tests of primordial non-Gaussianity.",
New submissions,An emulator for the ionizing photon mean free path in ultra-high resolution simulations: the implications of mean free path measurements for the reionization history,"Hurum Maksora Tohfa,Christopher Cain,Matthew McQuinn,Anson D'Aloisio",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Measurements of the mean free path of ionizing photons from high-redshift quasar spectra at $z \sim 5$-$6$ constrain the reionization history, but interpreting them requires modeling the kiloparsec-scale clumping that large-volume reionization simulations cannot resolve. We present a deep learning emulator for the mean free path (MFP) trained on high-resolution cosmological radiative transfer simulations of ionization fronts sweeping through small 2 comoving~Mpc/h volumes. Using a residual multi-layer perceptron neural network, we predict the MFP at a given redshift as a function of the reionization redshift, photoionization rate, wavelength, and box-scale density, achieving a median relative error of 1.6\% across nearly four orders of magnitude in MFP. Integrating its predictions over box-scale overdensity and an extended reionization history allows the emulator to predict the global MFP. We apply the emulator to extended reionization histories constrained by observed photoionization rates, finding that models prefer late reionization with substantial neutral fractions persisting at $z \lesssim 6$. Fitting a parametric ionization history yields a midpoint of reionization of $z_{\rm re} = 6.8\pm 1.2$ for reionization durations consistent with Planck and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich constraints, and the universe being $10\%$ neutral still at $z_{\rm re} < 5.8 ~(6.3)$ at 1~(2)$\sigma$. Global ionizing emissivity inferences using measurements of the photoionization rate and MFP plus our emulator, which avoids common power-law assumptions, suggest a factor of $2-3$ decline between $z = 6$ and $4.8$, in agreement with previous studies. Our method provides an efficient (and more converged) alternative to large-volume radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of reionization for interpreting MFP measurements, and can also serve as a subgrid prescription for the ionizing opacity within such simulations.",
New submissions,The local void model for the Hubble and BAO tensions,"Indranil Banik,Harry Desmond,Vasileios Kalaitzidis,Sergij Mazurenko",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z < 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$, the $\Lambda$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($\alpha_{\mathrm{iso}} < 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions.",
New submissions,pop-cosmos: Redshifts and physical properties of KiDS-1000 galaxies,"Anik Halder,Hiranya V. Peiris,Stephen Thorp,Boris Leistedt,Daniel J. Mortlock,Gurjeet Jagwani,Madalina N. Tudorache,Sinan Deger,Benedict Van den Bussche,Joel Leja,Angus H. Wright",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Principled Bayesian inference of galaxy properties has not previously been performed for wide-area weak lensing surveys with millions of sources. We address this gap by applying the pop-cosmos generative model to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for 4 million KiDS-1000 galaxies. Calibrated on deep COSMOS2020 photometric data, pop-cosmos specifies a physically-motivated prior over the galaxy population up to $z \simeq 6$ in stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameter space. Using the Speculator SPS emulator with GPU-accelerated MCMC sampling, we perform full posterior inference at 6.5 GPU seconds per galaxy, obtaining joint constraints on galaxy redshifts and physical properties. We validate photometric redshifts against $\sim\!185,\!000$ KiDS galaxies cross-matched to DESI DR1 spectroscopic samples, achieving low bias ($3\times10^{-3}$), scatter ($\sigma_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.04$), and outlier fraction (3.7%) for the Bright Galaxy Survey, with comparable performance (bias $3\times10^{-2}$, $\sigma_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.05$, 1.3% outliers) for luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Within the LRG sample, we identify massive, dusty, star-forming contaminants at $z \simeq 0.4$ satisfying standard colour selections for quenched populations. We infer trends in stellar mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust across five tomographic redshift bins consistent with established scaling relations. Using specific star formation rate constraints, we identify $\sim$10% of KiDS-1000 galaxies as quenched, versus 37% implied by conservative colour cuts. This enables the construction of weak lensing samples defined by physical properties while mitigating intrinsic alignment systematics and preserving statistical power. Our analysis validates pop-cosmos out-of-sample, establishing it as a scaleable approach for galaxy evolution and cosmological analyses in photometric surveys.",
New submissions,Dynamical Systematics on Time Delay Lenses and the Impact on the Hubble Constant,"R. Forés-Toribio,C. S. Kochanek,J. A. Muñoz",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"While time-delay lenses can be an independent probe of $H_0$ the estimates are degenerate with the convergence of the lens near the Einstein radius. Velocity dispersions, $\sigma$, can be used to break the degeneracy, with uncertainties $\Delta H/H_0 \propto \Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2$ ultimately limited by the systematic uncertainties in the kinematic measurements - measuring $H_0$ to 2% requires $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2$ < 2%. Here we explore a broad range of potential systematic uncertainties contributing to eight time-delay lenses used in cosmological analyses. We find that: (1) The characterization of the PSF both in absolute scale and in shape is important, with biases in $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2$ up to 1-6%, depending on the lens system. Small slit miscenterings of the lens are less important. (2) The difference between the measured velocity dispersion and the mean square velocity needed for the Jeans equations is important, with up to $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2 \sim$ 3-8%. (3) The choice of anisotropy models is important with maximum changes of $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2 \sim$ 5-18% and the frequently used Osipkov-Merritt models do not produce $h_4$ velocity moments typical of early-type galaxies. (4) Small differences between the true stellar mass distribution and the model light profile matter ($\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2 \sim$ 5-40%), with radial color gradients further complicating the problem. Finally, we discuss how the homogeneity of the early-type galaxy population means that many dynamically related parameters must be marginalized over the lens sample as a whole and not over individual lenses.",
New submissions,pop-cosmos: Forward modeling KiDS-1000 redshift distributions using realistic galaxy populations,"Boris Leistedt,Hiranya V. Peiris,Anik Halder,Stephen Thorp,Daniel J. Mortlock,Arthur Loureiro,Justin Alsing,Gurjeet Jagwani,Madalina N. Tudorache,Sinan Deger,Joel Leja,Benedict Van den Bussche,Angus H. Wright,Shun-Sheng Li,Konrad Kuijken,Hendrik Hildebrandt",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The accuracy of the cosmological constraints from Stage~IV galaxy surveys will be limited by how well the galaxy redshift distributions can be inferred. We have addressed this challenging problem for the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) cosmic shear sample by developing a forward-modeling framework with two main ingredients: (1) the \texttt{pop-cosmos} generative model for the evolving galaxy population, calibrated on \textit{Spitzer} IRAC $\textit{Ch.\,1}<26$ galaxies from COSMOS2020; and (2) a data model for noise and selection, machine-learned from the SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations (SKiLLS). Applying KiDS tomographic binning to our synthetic photometric data, we infer redshift distributions in each of five bins directly from the population and data models, bypassing the need for spectroscopic reweighting. Keeping the data model fixed, we compare results using two different galaxy population models: \texttt{pop-cosmos}; and \texttt{shark}, the semi-analytic galaxy formation model used in SKiLLS. In the first ($0.1<z<0.3$) and last ($0.9<z<1.2$) tomographic bins we find systematic differences in the mean redshifts of $\Delta z\sim0.05$-$0.1$, comparable to the reported uncertainties from spectroscopic reweighting methods. This work paves the way for accurate redshift distribution calibration for Stage~IV surveys directly through forward modeling, thus providing an independent cross-check on spectroscopic-based calibrations which avoids their selection biases and incompleteness. We will use the \texttt{pop-cosmos} redshift distributions in an upcoming full KiDS cosmology reanalysis.",
New submissions,A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum,"I. Dalianis,A. Katsis,N. Tetradis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.",
New submissions,From Nonparametric Distance Reconstruction to Testing the Etherington Relation and Cosmic Curvature Using 2D and 3D BAO Measurements,"Darshan Kumar(HNAS),Jie Zheng(HNAS),Zhi-Qiang You(HNAS),Da-Chun Qiang(HNAS)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a joint test of cosmic curvature, $\Omega_{k0}$, and the cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR) using the Etherington relation, which connects the luminosity and angular diameter distances at the same redshift. In this work, we combine the angular diameter distance measurements from recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) observations with luminosity distances reconstructed from Cosmic Chronometers data of Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using a non-parametric technique, Gaussian Process. A key part of our analysis is the systematic comparison of different BAO measurements (2D BAO, 3D BAO, and 3D DESI BAO) to determine whether any potential tension between angular and anisotropic BAO data affects constraints on the distance duality parameter $\eta(z)$ and $\Omega_{k0}$. We adopt four representative parameterizations of $\eta(z)$ to examine the correlation between $\eta(z)$ and $\Omega_{k0}$. Our results show no evidence for violation of the CDDR, with $\eta(z)$ consistent with unity at the 99\% confidence level for all BAO datasets and parameterizations. In all scenarios, the best-fit values of $\Omega_{k0}$ mildly favor a non-flat universe, although a spatially flat universe remains compatible at the 95\% confidence level. The constraints on $\eta_1$ and $\Omega_{k0}$ indicate slight variations across different BAO datasets, but the discrepancies between the 2D and 3D BAO measurements do not introduce any significant bias, and no statistically meaningful tension is observed. Our work provides robust constraints on cosmic curvature and the validity of the CDDR based on non-parametric distance reconstruction.",
New submissions,Parametric Resonance and Backreaction Effects in Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Dark Matter,"Nirmalya Brahma,Robert Brandenberger(McGill University)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We take a more detailed look at the recently proposed magnetogenesis mechanism triggered by ultralight dark matter coupled to electromagnetism. The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects.",
New submissions,Large-scale halo velocity correlations and the impact of finite simulation volumes,"Yao-Tsung Chuang,Teppei Okumura,Takahiro Nishimichi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The velocity correlation functions directly measured from the peculiar velocity field of dark matter in numerical simulations are known to have an amplitude lower than that predicted by theoretical models at large scales. The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $f\sigma_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators.",
New submissions,A model-independent measurement of the Hubble constant from gravitational-wave standard sirens and electromagnetic observations,"Gaurav N. Gadbail,Kazuharu Bamba",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Hubble tension is one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. Developing new approaches to estimate the Hubble constant is therefore crucial, and in this work, we employ a Gaussian process, a fully model-independent method that relies solely on observational data. To determine the Hubble constant, we use not only electromagnetic observations but also include gravitational-wave standard siren data from GWTC3. Our measurements of the Hubble constant are strongly consistent with the SH0ES result, with tensions less than $2\sigma$, indicating no statistically significant discrepancy. This approach quantifies the impact of gravitational-wave data on the determination of the Hubble constant, examines its consistency with electromagnetic measurements, and explores its potential role in addressing the Hubble tension.",
New submissions,Weak Lensing Low Multipoles,"Albert Bonnefous,Roya Mohayaee",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We analyse the low-multipole components of the weak-lensing convergence field in a FLRW universe. The low-multipole convergence field, encodes the largest-angle coherent potential gradients, essential for assessment of large-angle features in data. To study this large angle signal, we perform a combined analytical, numerical and observational study. Starting from exact analytical expressions for the convergence power spectrum, we quantify how the dipole, quadrupole and octupole build up with source redshift and show that, in $\Lambda$CDM, they saturate at an amplitude of order $10^{-4}$. We then use full-sky, horizon-scale $N$-body simulations (Quijote) to explore the dependence of this signal on the observer's environment, comparing random observers to ``Milky Way-like'' observers. In parallel, we reconstruct the convergence field due to our local Universe with the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), with proper treatment of incompleteness and galaxy bias. We find that the observed low multipoles from observation is above the $\Lambda$CDM mean predictions, but in full agreement with Milky Way-like observers in the simulation. Finally, by converting the convergence dipole into a number-count dipole, we test whether weak lensing can contribute to the cosmic dipole anomaly, an idea motivated by its natural alignment with the CMB dipole and by the fact that lensing, unlike clustering, cannot be removed by cross-matching surveys and thus survives in all high-redshift catalogues. We show that weak lensing by local structure contributes at most a few percent to this observed anomaly.",
New submissions,Separation of polarized dust emission in Planck observations with Scattering Transforms,"Alexandros Tsouros,Elisa Russier,Erwan Allys,Constant Auclair,François Boulanger,Jacques Delabrouille",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Polarized dust emission is a major astrophysical foreground contaminant of the cosmic microwave background polarization (CMB), which must be accurately measured to look for the faint primordial polarization B-modes of inflationary origin. The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced.",
New submissions,The Standard siren tests of viable $f(R)$ cosmologies,"Yi Zhang,Xuanjun Niu,Xianfu Su,Dong-Ze He",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We constrain the Hu-Sawicki and Starobinsky $f(R)$ gravity models utilizing current electromagnetic (PP+CC, Planck and DESI2) datasets and simulate standard siren catalogs based on the resulting best-fit parameters. We demonstrate that the simulated SS data provide complementary sensitivity to the modified gravitational wave propagation friction term, thereby enhancing the discriminating power between $f(R)$ gravity and the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, we note that standard sirens do not offer a viable resolution to the Hubble tension in this analysis, as the inferred constraints are predominantly driven by the fiducial cosmologies adopted in the simulations. Regarding the specific models, we find that for the Hu-Sawicki scenario, several data combinations favor $F_{RR0}<0$, implying potential theoretical instabilities. And, for the Starobinsky model, while EM-only constraints are nearly symmetric between the two parameter branches ($b<0$ and $b>0$), the inclusion of SS constraints introduces mild asymmetries, revealing the sensitivity of SS observables to the curvature dependence of the theory. Future truly independent standard siren observations would be crucial for a definitive assessment of $f(R)$ gravity as an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM.",
New submissions,Unclustered tracers remain unclustered: the lack of primordial non-Gaussianity response of bias-zero tracers,"Celia Merino,Santiago Avila,A. G. Adame,A. Anguren,V. Gonzalez-Perez,J. Meneses-Rizo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Constraining primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) is one of the main goals of new-generation large-scale galaxy surveys. It had been proposed that unclustered tracers (with bias $b_1=0$) could be optimal for PNG studies, and that these could be found by selecting galaxies in bins of their local density. Here, we test this hypothesis in state-of-the-art simulations from the PNG-UNITsim suite with local $f_{\rm NL}=100$ and $f_{\rm NL}=-20$. We consider different parent tracer catalogues: all halos together, halos in large mass bins, and HOD models for LRGs and QSO. We then classify these tracers by their local density ($\delta_{t,R}$) and measure the linear bias ($b_1$) and PNG-response ($b_\phi$). Most $\delta_{t,R}$ bins show a PNG-response compatible with $b_\phi=0$ for all halos or the low-mass bin (log$M<11$). For high-mass halos (log$M>$12), QSO or LRG, we recover a trend closer to the universality relation ($b_\phi = 2 \delta_{\rm crit}(b_1-1)$) for $b_1>1$, but the $b_\phi(b_1)$ curve flattens to 0 below $\vert b_1\lvert<1$. Hence, we find $b_\phi\approx0$ for all bias-zero tracers considered. The complex $\delta_{t,R}$-based selection causes their clustering to strongly deviate from simple assumptions, namely the universality relation and Poisson shot noise, hindering their capability to constrain PNG.",
New submissions,Measurement of the Hubble constant using the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Gold galaxy catalog and the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog,"Isaac McMahon,Danny Laghi,Marcelle Soares-Santos,Kendall Ackley,Gergely Dálya,Yavuz Gençel,David Sánchez-Cid,Felipe Andrade-Oliveira,Sean MacBride,Christian Chapman-Bird,Rachel Gray,Alexander Papadopoulos",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational wave standard sirens enable independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$. In the absence of electromagnetic counterparts, the ""dark siren"" method statistically correlates GW events with potential host galaxies. We present a measurement of $H_0$ using 142 compact binary coalescences from the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) combined with the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Gold photometric galaxy catalog. Using the gwcosmo pipeline, we jointly infer cosmological and GW population parameters. We analyze the impact of galaxy catalog properties on the inference, identifying significant features in the galaxy redshift distribution which can introduce biases. By restricting the galaxy catalog to $0.05<z<0.35$ to maintain consistency with a uniform in comoving volume galaxy distribution, we obtain a result of $H_0 = 70.9^{+22.3}_{-18.6}\;\text{km}\;\text{s}^{-1}\;\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ from dark sirens and $H_0=73.1^{+11.7}_{-8.6}\;\text{km}\;\text{s}^{-1}\;\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ when combined with the bright siren GW170817. This study demonstrates the adaptation of deep galaxy catalogs for GW cosmology, highlighting key challenges and methodologies essential for maximizing the potential of next-generation galaxy surveys.",
Cross submissions,Electromagnetic Couplings of Dark Domain Walls,Nemanja Kaloper,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We extend Maxwell electrodynamics with a Chern--Simons coupling to a dark sector top form sourced by domain walls. Electromagnetic fields which cross such domain walls exhibit optical activity. We outline the parameter space where the theory satisfies the observational bounds from domain wall nucleation rates and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this regime, the discretely evanescent dark energy walls can produce a polarization rotation of cosmic microwave background by $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3} ~{\rm radians}$.",
Cross submissions,Ultralight time-oscillating scalars from magnetized compact stars: electrophilic radiation and photon propagation effects,"Tanmay kumar Poddar,Gaetano Lambiase",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Ultralight scalars with electrophilic couplings to the time-dependent Goldreich-Julian charge density of magnetized compact stars can be radiated from their magnetospheres, contributing to pulsar spin-down. Coupling to the time-independent component of the charge density instead generates a quadrupolar scalar field profile, which may influence the orbital dynamics of binary systems. Such scalars can also interact with the time-varying electromagnetic fields of magnetized stars, modifying photon propagation and inducing observable effects in the redshift and residual time-delay measurements, as well as corrections to the background electromagnetic fields. We investigate these phenomena for the Crab pulsar, SGR 1806-20, and GRB 080805A. Using spectral and timing observations, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron and scalar-photon couplings. While the bounds obtained on the scalar-electron coupling from pulsar spin-down are weaker than existing limits, electromagnetic radiation measurements yield the strongest astrophysical constraints to date on the scalar-photon coupling. Compact stars with stronger surface magnetic fields and observations at lower photon frequencies can improve these bounds by several orders of magnitude.",
Cross submissions,Impact of Higher-Order Modes on Eccentricity Measurement in Binary Black Hole Gravitational Waves,"Honglue Tang,Jinzhao Yang,Baoxiang Wang,Tao Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We investigate the systematic biases in measuring orbital eccentricity for binary black hole (BBH) mergers that arise when higher-order modes (HOMs) of gravitational waves are neglected in waveform modeling. Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($\Delta_e/\sigma > 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\rm det}\gtrsim120M_\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($\theta_\textrm{JN} \gtrsim 30^\circ$), and high SNRs ($\rho^N_\textrm{mf}\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\rm det}\gtrsim140M_\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\rm det}\sim100 M_\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors.",
Cross submissions,Near-Resonant Thermal Leptogenesis,Angus Spalding,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study leptogenesis in the quasi-degenerate but non-resonant regime. Expanding the CP asymmetry parameter near degeneracy and imposing the conservative non-resonance condition that the mass splitting must be much greater than the right-handed neutrino decay rates $\Delta M > 100\Gamma_i$, yields the universal upper bound $\epsilon \leq 1/200$, independent of both the effective neutrino masses and the right-handed neutrino mass. We investigate vanilla and flavoured near-resonant leptogenesis and find that successful leptogenesis by right-handed neutrino decays can occur for $M \gtrsim 100~\mathrm{GeV}$ independent of washout regime, extending the viable parameter space of thermal leptogenesis down to the electroweak scale without invoking resonance. We also analyse near-resonant thermal leptogenesis during reheating and show that successful baryon asymmetry generation is compatible with reheating temperatures as low as $T_{RH}\simeq 10\rm GeV$ without relying on non-thermal production. Finally, we present a consistent framework for incorporating flavour effects in near-resonant leptogenesis during reheating. Overall, near-resonant thermal leptogenesis offers a controlled alternative regime to resonant leptogenesis, lowering the leptogenesis scale to the electroweak scale, without reliance on a disputed regulator used in resonant leptogenesis.",
Cross submissions,Primordial black holes as cosmic accelerators of light dark matter: Novel direct detection constraints,"Sk Jeesun,Anirban Majumdar,Rahul Srivastava",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Current multiton dark matter (DM) detectors are largely incapable of detecting light dark matter from the Galactic halo due to the energy threshold limitations of their recoil measurements. However, primordial black holes (PBHs) can evaporate via Hawking radiation to particles whose energies are set by the black hole temperature. Consequently, weakly interacting light dark matter (or dark radiation) particles produced in this manner can reach the Earth with sufficient flux and kinetic energy above the experimental thresholds. This opens up a novel avenue to probe the light dark sector in terrestrial experiments. In this work, we explore this possibility by considering fermionic DM produced through PBH evaporation and investigate its electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments. We analyze both energy independent (constant) and energy dependent (scalar and vector mediated) DM-electron interactions, highlighting the strong dependence of the recoil spectra on the underlying Lorentz structure of the interaction. In addition, we also account for the attenuation effects due to loss of kinetic energy while DM traverses through Earth's crust, which can significantly modify the incoming DM flux. Incorporating these effects carefully, we place constraints on light DM using the electron recoil data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T. Finally, we also discuss the detection prospects of such dark matter in current and future generation neutrino detectors, such as Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande.",
