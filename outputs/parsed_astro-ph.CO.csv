New submissions,Effective Field Theory Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from the High-Redshift Lyman-$α$ Forest,"Mikhail M. Ivanov,Sokratis Trifinopoulos",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present updated constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) dark matter from the high-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from MIKE/HIRES experiments. Our analysis leverages an effective field theory (EFT) description of the 1D flux power spectrum, allowing us to analytically predict the Lyman-$\alpha$ fluctuations on quasi-linear scales from first principles. Our EFT-based likelihood enables robust inference across redshifts $z = 4.2-5.4$ and down to scales of 100 kpc, within previously unexplored regions of parameter space for this dataset. We derive new bounds on the PBH fraction with respect to the total dark matter $f_{\text{PBH}}$, excluding populations with $f_{\text{PBH}} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ for masses $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 10^{4}-10^{16} M_{\odot}$. This offers the leading constraint for PBHs heavier than $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and highlights the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a uniquely sensitive probe of new physics models that modify the structure formation history of our universe.",
New submissions,Evaluating the Accuracy of Reionization Prescriptions in Semi-analytic Models of the First Stars and Galaxies,"Thomas Behling,Ryan Hazlett,Mihir Kulkarni,Eli Visbal",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Semi-analytic models are a valuable tool to study the first stars and galaxies. Their numerical efficiency makes it possible to survey broad regions of astrophysical parameter space across large volumes and redshift ranges. Following reionization in these models is necessary since star formation is suppressed in ionized regions due to photoheating of the gas. Here we evaluate the accuracy of three semi-analytic reionization prescriptions (two previously developed and one new model) by comparing their three-dimensional distribution of ionized bubbles to the Renaissance hydrodynamical cosmological radiative transfer simulations. We find that the previously existing models accurately determine the distribution of the larger bubbles within our ${\sim}6$ comoving Mpc simulation box, but that these models fail to take into account self-shielded neutral gas in dense filaments. Thus, these prescriptions overestimate the fraction of halos in HII regions impacted by reionization feedback by up to an order of magnitude (depending on halo mass and redshift). This leads to an unrealistically large effect of reionization feedback on Pop III stars and low-mass metal-enriched galaxies. Our newly developed model takes into account the density structure of the cosmic web, leading to good agreement with Renaissance in the fraction of halos found in ionized regions.",
New submissions,XRISM Reveals Complex Multi-Temperature Structures in the Abell 2029 Galaxy Cluster,"Arnab Sarkar,Eric Miller,Naomi Ota,Caroline Kilbourne,Brian McNamara,Ming Sun,Lorenzo Lovisari,Stefano Ettori,Dominique Eckert,Andrew Szymkowiak,Tommaso Bartalesi,Michael Loewenstein",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We present $\sim$500 ks XRISM observations covering the central and two northern regions of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. Resolve enables us to distinguish multiple emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like iron (Fe) ions. This study focuses on the multi-temperature structure of Abell 2029 using line-ratio diagnostics. Using a single-temperature collisionally ionized equilibrium model, we measure average plasma temperatures of 6.73 keV, 7.61 keV, and 8.14 keV in the central, inner northern, and outer northern regions, respectively, spanning a radial range up to 700 kpc. To further investigate thermal structure, we derive excitation and ionization temperatures by comparing observed emission-line flux ratios with atomic database predictions. Significant deviations from the single-temperature CIE model in the central and inner northern regions indicate the presence of multi-phase gas. The excitation and ionization temperatures range from 2.85 keV to 8.5 keV in the central region, 4.3 keV to 9.8 keV in the inner northern region, and 8.3 keV to 10.4 keV in the outer northern region. These temperature distributions are largely consistent with the previously observed temperature gradient of A2029. However, Resolve detects two notably cooler components--3.42 keV in the central region and $\sim$4.3 keV in the inner northern region--likely associated with displaced cool gas due to gas sloshing. Additionally, we thermally resolve a 2.85 keV gas component at the core of A2029--potentially a significant development in our understanding of gas cooling. We propose that this cooler gas is a direct product of ongoing cooling processes in A2029, having already cooled to its present temperature. If this temperature structure is stable and no heating mechanism is present, this reservoir is likely to cool to even lower temperatures and form stars.",
New submissions,Hubble constant constraint using 117 FRBs with a more accurate probability density function for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$,"Jiaming Zhuge,Marios Kalomenopoulos,Bing Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most mysterious astronomical transients. Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\sigma_{\rm diff}$ in the probability density function ($p_{\rm diff}$) for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$, and rewrite their likelihood convolution to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\sigma_{\rm diff} \sim F/\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\rm diff}$. Our method yields a constraint of $H_0\Omega_b f_{\rm diff} = 2.812_{-0.258}^{+0.250}$ or $H_0 = 66.889_{-5.460}^{+6.754}$ when combining the FRB data with CMB measurements and taking $f_{\rm diff} = 0.84$. This fully analytical correction helps us to better constrain cosmological parameters with the increasing number of localized FRBs available today.",
New submissions,Bianchi Type I Model Cannot Explain the Observed CMB Angular Acoustic Scale Directional Variation,"Boris Hoi-Lun Ng,Ming-Chung Chu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Anisotropic cosmological models have been gaining attention due to various observational hints of large-scale anisotropies. One of the most surprising evidences for the latter is the discovery of a dipole-like directional variation in cosmological parameters extracted from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. In this work, we show that the directional variation of the CMB angular acoustic angle calculated with the fully asymmetric Bianchi Type I metric, a simple extension of the standard Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric, cannot account for the observed dipole-like anisotropy.",
New submissions,CLASH-VLT: The variance of the velocity anisotropy profiles of galaxy clusters,"A. Biviano,E.A. Maraboli,L. Pizzuti,P. Rosati,A. Mercurio,G. De Lucia,C. Ragone-Figueroa,C. Grillo,G.L. Granato,M. Girardi,B. Sartoris,M. Annunziatella",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The velocity anisotropy profiles, $\beta(r)$, of galaxy clusters are directly related to the shape of the orbits of their member galaxies. Knowledge of $\beta(r)$ is important to understand the assembly process of clusters and the evolutionary processes of their galaxies, and to improve the determination of cluster masses based on cluster kinematics. We determine the $\beta(r)$ of nine massive clusters at redshift $0.19 \leq z \leq 0.45$ from the CLASH-VLT data set, with 150 to 950 spectroscopic members each, to understand how much cluster-to-cluster variance exists in the $\beta(r)$ of different clusters and what is the main driver of this variance. We select spectroscopic cluster members with the CLUMPS algorithm calibrated on cosmological simulations. We apply the MAMPOSSt code to the distribution of cluster members in projected phase-space to constrain the cluster mass profile, $M(r)$, using priors derived from a previous gravitational lensing analysis. Given the MAMPOSSt best-fit solution for $M(r)$, we then solve the inversion of the Jeans equation to determine $\beta(r)$ without assumptions of its functional form. We also run the DS+ code to identify subclusters and characterize the dynamical status of our clusters. The average $\beta(r)$ is slightly radial, with the anisotropy increasing from $\beta \simeq 0.2$ at the cluster center, to $\beta \simeq 0.4$ at the virial radius. There is substantial variance in the $\beta(r)$ of the individual clusters, that cannot be entirely accounted for by the observational uncertainties. Clusters of lower mass and with a low concentration per given mass have more tangential $\beta(r)$'s. Clusters hosting a rich subcluster have $\beta(r)$ deviating more strongly from the average $\beta(r)$.",
New submissions,The impact of galaxy bias on cross-correlation tomography,"Sara Maleubre,Matteo Zennaro,David Alonso,Ian McCarthy,Matthieu Schaller,Joop Schaye",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The cross-correlation of galaxies at different redshifts with other tracers of the large-scale structure can be used to reconstruct the cosmic mean of key physical quantities, and their evolution over billions of years, at high precision. However, a correct interpretation of these measurements must ensure that they are independent of the clustering properties of the galaxy sample used. In this paper we explore different prescriptions to extract tomographic reconstruction measurements and use the FLAMINGO hydrodynamic simulations to show that a robust estimator, independent of the small-scale galaxy bias, can be constructed. We focus on the tomographic reconstruction of the halo bias-weighted electron pressure $\langle bP_e\rangle$ and star-formation density $\langle b\rho_{\rm SFR}\rangle$, which can be reconstructed from tomographic analysis of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background maps, respectively. We show that these quantities can be reconstructed with an accuracy of 1-3\% over a wide range of redshifts, using different galaxy samples. We also show that these measurements can be accurately interpreted using the halo model, assuming a sufficiently reliable model can be constructed for the halo mass function, large-scale halo bias, and for the dependence of the physical quantities being reconstructed on halo mass.",
New submissions,Constraints on transition redshift utilizing the latest H(z) measurements and comments on the Hubble tension,"Jianping Hu,Xuandong Jia,DaoHong Gao,Jiaze Gao,Baoquan Gao,Fayin Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The motivation of this paper is to obtain reliable constraints of transition redshift ($z_{ztr}$) and, in combination with the evolution of the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$) that could alleviate the Hubble tension, discuss the possible origin of the tension. Utilizing the latest H(z) measurements and different methods ($\Lambda$CDM model, Cosmography, and Gaussian process method), we investigated the impact of methodology and dataset on $z_{ztr}$ constraints, and find that the choice of method has a greater impact on $z_{tr}$ than the observations themselves. Through a statistical analysis of the $z_{ztr}$ constraints from 2004 to 2024, we find that total $z_{tr}$ constraints (2004$-$2024) can be well described by a Gaussian function with the mean value 0.65 and the standard deviation 0.16; that is, $\bar{z}_{tr}$(all) = 0.65 $\pm$ 0.16. And we confirmed that both dataset and methodology can indeed significantly affect the final constraints. The screened $z_{tr}$ constraints with free $H_{0}$ gives a new result $\bar{z}_{tr}$(free) = 0.64 $\pm$ 0.16. Coincidentally, the $z_{tr}$ results overlap with the initial moment of $H_{0}$ evolution ($H_{0}$ value starts to deviate from the Planck result). This may suggest that the Hubble tension might be closely related to this particular period in the evolution of the Universe.",
New submissions,"Cosmic string gravitational wave backgrounds at LISA: I. Signal survey, template reconstruction, and model comparison","Androniki Dimitriou,Daniel G. Figueroa,Peera Simakachorn,Bryan Zaldivar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present a catalog of gravitational wave background (GWB) signal templates from cosmic-string networks, based on relevant models proposed in the literature. We classify templates as conventional, based on standard cosmology and Nambu-Goto results (VOS and BOS), and beyond conventional, based on modifications of a) the loop number density (LRS, super, metastable, current-carrying strings), b) the expansion history (non-standard cosmologies, extra degrees of freedom, either thermal or secluded), or c) the loop properties (birth length, power emission). Using the SBI package $\texttt{GWBackFinder}$, we quantify the reconstruction precision of each signal by LISA, scanning over their parameter space, and performing model comparisons. For conventional signals, LISA reconstructs the tension $G\mu$ with an error $\lesssim 10\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-15}$, which decreases down to $2-3\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 10^{-12}$. BOS and VOS modelings become distinguishable confidently for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-13}$. For beyond-conventional signals, we identify SNR and error-threshold intervals for each parameter, and determine (for few examples) the regions where they can be distinguished from conventional signals. Analogous quality reconstruction studies of cosmic-string GWBs, superimposed over leading astrophysical foregrounds in the LISA window, will be presented in a series of upcoming papers.",
New submissions,Constraints on DBI dark energy with chameleon mechanism,"Burin Gumjudpai,Nandan Roy,John Ward",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we investigate the Dirac Born Infeld chameleon scalar field model in light of the latest cosmological observations, analyzing the model both with the incorporation of the chameleon mechanism and without it. Results from current cosmological observations, such as Pantheon Plus, DES Y5, DESI DR2, and the compressed Planck likelihood, are used to constrain the model. We consider the AdS throat in the form of $f(\phi) = \lambda / \phi^4$ and a potential $V(\phi) = m_0^2 \phi^2 + m_1^2 \phi^4$ .One interesting finding from our analysis is that, without the chameleon mechanism, the mean value of $m_1 \simeq 0$ indicates the self-interaction of the DBI field could potentially be negligible. Constraints on the potential parameters do not appear when considering the chameleon mechanism, but the warp parameter and chameleon coupling parameter are forced to satisfy $\eta \geq 0$ and $\beta \leq 0$. Different choices of $\beta$ render the same background cosmological parameters. The equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ resides more in the quintessence region in the past. There is no phantom crossing in this model under our assumption of the warp throat and potential. By computing the $\Delta \text{AIC}$ relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, we study statistical model comparison. The model as a candidate of dynamical dark energy is observationally viable at the cosmological background level.",

Silber,D. Sprayberry,G. Tarlé,B. A. Weaver,J. Yu,R. Zhou,H. Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This paper demonstrates how the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) and future baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) analyses can optimally combine overlapping tracers (galaxies of distinct types) in the same redshift range. We make a unified catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) in the redshift range 0.8 < z < 1.1 and investigate the impact on the BAO constraints. DESI DR1 contains ~30% of the final DESI LRG sample and less than 25% of the final ELG sample, and the combination of LRGs and ELGs increases the number density and reduces the shot noise. We developed a pipeline to merge the overlapping tracers using galaxy bias as an approximately optimal weight and tested the pipeline on a suite of Abacus simulations, calibrated on the final version of the DESI Early Data Release. When applying our pipeline to the DESI DR1 catalog, we find an improvement in the BAO constraints of 11% for $\alpha_\mathrm{iso}$ and ~7.0% for $\alpha_\mathrm{AP}$ consistent with our findings in mock catalogs. Our analysis was integrated into the DESI DR1 BAO analysis to produce the LRG+ELG result in the 0.8 < z < 1.1 redshift bin, which provided the most precise BAO measurement from DESI DR1 with a 0.86% constraint on the BAO distance scale and a $9.1\sigma$ detection of the isotropic BAO feature.",
Cross submissions,Search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes with an effective-one-body template,"Yi-Fan Wang,Alexander H. Nitz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"As gravitational wave astronomy has entered an era of routine detections, it becomes increasingly important to precisely measure the physical parameters of individual events and infer population properties. Eccentricity is a key observable, suggesting that binaries form in a dense stellar environment through dynamical encounters. This work performs the first matched-filtering search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes (BBHs) covering the mass range $[5, 200]~M_\odot$ and eccentricity at 20 Hz up to 0.5 with a newly developed effective-one-body waveform model. Throughout the third observation run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, we identify 28 BBH events with a false alarm rate below once per 100 yr; all of which were previously reported in the GWTC-3 and 4-OGC catalogs. Additional candidates with false alarm rates between once per 1 and 100 yr are also reported. We perform an injection campaign to characterize the sensitive volume time of our search pipeline. Assuming that none of the eccentric BBH events were missed by previous searches, our results provide constraints on the event rate of eccentric BBHs in the mass range [5, 30] $M_\odot$. For a 30-30 $M_\odot$ BBH with eccentricity 0.5, the event rate is limited to less than 0.06 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$; this marks an order of magnitude improvement for sensitive volume compared with the previous search with a minimally modeled algorithm without using templates.",
