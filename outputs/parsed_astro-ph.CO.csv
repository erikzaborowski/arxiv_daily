New submissions,A New Recipe for Caustic Pancakes: On the Reality of Walls in the Cosmic Web,"Benjamin Hertzsch,Job Feldbrugge,Maé Rodriguez,Rien van de Weygaert",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The caustic skeleton model is a mathematically rigorous framework for studying the formation history of the emerging cosmic web from the caustics in the underlying dark matter flow. In a series of two papers, we use constrained N-body simulations to investigate the different cosmic web environments. For the current study, we focus on the cosmic walls. We derive the conditions of the centres of proto-walls and analyse their evolution with N-body simulations. Next, we investigate the statistical properties of Zel'dovich pancakes by studying the number density of the cosmic wall centres in scale space and, for the first time, we calculate the Lagrangian-space volume of cosmic walls. Finally, we infer the mean density and velocity fields and the distribution of haloes around cosmic walls with a suite of physically realistic dark-matter-only simulations. We compare the cosmic walls obtained with the caustic skeleton framework with previously proposed saddle point conditions on the primordial potential and density perturbation.",
New submissions,4MOST Cosmology Redshift Survey (CRS): Clustering properties of CRS BG and LRG target catalogues,"Behnood Bandi,Antoine Rocher,Aurélien Verdier,Jon Loveday,Zhuo Chen,Johan Richard,Jean-Paul Kneib,Tom Shanks,Michael J. I. Brown",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The 4MOST Cosmology Redshift Survey (CRS) will obtain nearly 5.4 million spectroscopic redshifts over $\sim5700$\,deg$^2$ to map large-scale structure and enable measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), growth rates via redshift-space distortions, and cross-correlations with weak-lensing surveys. We validate the target selections, photometry, masking, systematics and redshift distributions of the CRS Bright Galaxy (BG) and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) target catalogues selected from DESI Legacy Surveys DR10.1 imaging. We measure the angular two-point correlation function, test masking strategies, and recover redshift distributions via cross-correlation with DESI DR1 spectroscopy. For BG, we adopt Legacy Survey \texttt{MASKBITS} that veto bright stars, SGA large galaxies, and globular clusters; for LRG, we pair these with an unWISE W1 artefact mask. These choices suppress small-scale excess power without imprinting large-scale modes. A Limber-scaling test across BG $r$-band magnitude slices shows that, after applying the scaling, the $w(\theta)$ curves collapse to a near-common power law over the fitted angular range, demonstrating photometric uniformity with depth and consistency between the North (NGC) and South (SGC) Galactic Caps. Cross-correlations with DESI spectroscopy recover the expected $N(z)$, with higher shot noise at the brightest magnitudes. For LRGs, angular clustering in photo-$z$ slices ($0.4\le z<1.0$) is mutually consistent between the DECaLS and DES footprints at fixed $z$ and is well described by an approximate power law once photo-$z$ smearing is accounted for; halo-occupation fits yield results consistent with recent LRG studies. Together, these tests indicate that the masks and target selections yield uniform clustering statistics, supporting precision large-scale structure analyses with 4MOST CRS.",
New submissions,Reheating with Thermal Dissipation and Primordial Gravitational Waves,"Kazuma Minami,Kyohei Mukaida,Kazunori Nakayama",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In order for an inflationary universe to evolve into a hot universe, a process known as reheating is required. However, the precise mechanism of reheating remains unknown. We show that if the reheating is triggered by thermal dissipation effects, distinctive features appear in the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves. This suggests a possible way to observationally probe the physics of reheating.",
New submissions,The anisotropic expansion rate of the local Universe and its covariant cosmographic interpretation,"Basheer Kalbouneh,Christian Marinoni,Roy Maartens,Julien Bel,Jessica Santiago,Chris Clarkson,Maharshi Sarma,Jean-Marc Virey",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Without making any assumption on the underlying geometry and metric of the local Universe, we provide a measurement of the expansion rate fluctuation field using the Cosmicflows-4 and Pantheon+ samples in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.1$ ($30 \,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc} < R < 300\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$). The amplitude of the anisotropic fluctuations is found to be of order a few percent relative to the monopole of the expansion rate.We further decompose the expansion rate fluctuation field into spherical harmonic components and analyze their evolution with redshift across the studied redshift range. At low redshift, the dipole is clearly dominant, with an amplitude of $\sim (2.2 \pm 0.15)\times 10^{-2}$, significantly larger than the higher--order modes. As redshift increases, the dipole amplitude steadily decreases, reaching roughly half its value in the highest redshift bin investigated. The quadrupole is also significant, at about half the dipole amplitude, and persists across all redshift bins, with no clear decreasing trend, although uncertainties grow at higher redshift. A nonzero octupole is also detected at low redshift. The dipole, quadrupole, and octupole components are found to be aligned, exhibiting axial symmetry around a common axis ($l = 295^\circ,\, b = 5^\circ$).We interpret the observed fluctuations in the expansion rate within the framework of covariant cosmography. Our results indicate that the multipoles of the expansion rate fluctuation field are primarily driven by a strong quadrupole in the covariant Hubble parameter, together with dipole and octupole contributions from the covariant deceleration parameter. These few parameters suffice to reconstruct the luminosity distance with high precision out to $z \sim 0.1$, in a manner that is model--independent, non--perturbative, and free from assumptions about peculiar velocities.",
New submissions,Analysis of the plane of satellites around Milky Way-like galaxies in $Λ$CDM cosmology,"Xinghai Zhao,Guobao Tang,Paola Gonzalez,Grant J. Mathews,Lara Arielle Phillips",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"It has been suggested that the Plane of Satellites (PoS) phenomenon may imply a tension with current $\Lambda$CDM cosmology since a Milky-Way (MW)-like PoS is very rare in simulations. In this study, we analyze a large sample of satellite systems of MW-like galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We analyze their spatial aspect ratio, orbital pole dispersion, Gini coefficient, radial distribution, and bulk satellite velocity relative to the host galaxy. These are compared to the observed Milky~Way PoS. We identified galaxy samples in two mass ranges ($0.1 - 0.8 \times 10^{12} $ M$_\odot$ and $0.8 - 3.0 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$). We find for both mass ranges that only $\sim$ 1 percent of MW-like galaxies contain a PoS similar to that of the MW. Nevertheless, these outliers occur naturally in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We analyze the formation, environment, and evolution of the PoS for nine systems that are most MW-like. We suggest that a PoS can form from one or more of at least five different processes. A massive Magellanic~Cloud (MC)-like satellite is found in 1/3 of the systems and probably plays an important role in the PoS formation. We find a tendency for about half of the satellites to have recently arrived at $z < 0.5$, indicating that a MW-like PoS is a recent and transient phenomenon. We also find that a spin up of the angular momentum amplitude of the most massive satellites is an indicator of the recent in-fall of the PoS satellites.",
New submissions,Gravitational lensing by a spiral galaxy I: the influence from bar's structure to the flux ratio anomaly,"Xikai Shan,Yunpeng Jin,Shude Mao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Gravitational lens flux ratio anomalies are a powerful probe of small-scale mass structures within lens galaxies. These anomalies are often attributed to dark matter subhalos, but the baryonic components of the lens can also play a significant role. This study investigates the impact of galactic bars, a common feature in spiral galaxies, on flux ratio anomalies. We conduct a systematic analysis using a sample of 21 barred galaxies from the high-resolution Auriga cosmological simulations. First, we model the projected mass distribution of these galaxies with the Multi-Gaussian Expansion formalism. This method yields smooth lens potentials that preserve the primary bar structure while mitigating numerical noise. We then perform strong lensing simulations and quantify the flux ratio anomalies by measuring their deviation from the theoretical cusp-caustic relation. To characterize the structural properties of the bars, we use a Fourier decomposition of the surface mass density in the bar region. Our primary finding is a strong, statistically significant correlation between the magnitude of the flux ratio anomaly and the strength of higher-order even Fourier modes. Specifically, the strengths of the boxy/peanut and hexapole components show an exceptionally tight correlation with the flux anomaly, with Spearman correlation coefficients of r=0.85 and 0.89, and p-values on the order of 1e-6 and 1e-8, respectively. This demonstrates that flux ratio anomalies are highly sensitive to the complex, non-axisymmetric features of galactic bars. We conclude that the flux ratio anomaly can be a powerful indicator of a galactic bar's complex morphology. Failing to account for a bar's complex morphology can lead to a misinterpretation of the lensing signature, potentially causing an overestimation of the dark matter subhalo population.",
New submissions,HR-pyPopStar II: high spectral resolution evolutionary synthesis models low metallicity expansion and the properties of the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies,"I. Millán-Irigoyen,M. Mollá,M. Cerviño,M.L. García-Vargas",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"Low metallicity stellar populations are very abundant in the Universe, either as the remnants of the past history of the Milky Way or similar spiral galaxies, or the young low metallicity stellar populations that are being observed in the local dwarf galaxies or in the high-z objects with low metal content recently found with JWST. Our goal is to develop new high-spectral-resolution models tailored for low-metallicity environments and apply them to analyse stellar population data, particularly in cases where a significant portion of the stellar content exhibits low metallicity. Methods. We used the state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis code HR-pyPopStar with available stellar libraries to create a new set of models focused on low metallicity stellar populations. We have compared the new spectral energy distributions with the previous models of HR-pyPopStar for solar metallicity. Once we verified that the spectra, except for the oldest ages that show some differences in the molecular bands of the TiO and G band, are similar, we reanalysed the high resolution data from the globular cluster M 15 by finding a better estimate of its age and metallicity. Finally, we analysed a subsample of mostly star-forming dwarf galaxies from the MaNGA survey we found similar stellar mass-mean stellar metallicity weighted by light to other studies that studied star forming dwarf galaxies and slightly higher mean stellar metallicity than the other works that analysed all types of dwarf galaxies at the same time, but are within error bars.",
New submissions,BaBy Cosmic Tension,Christophe Ringeval,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We show that the recently released B-mode polarisation data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) favour a non-vanishing contribution of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin which is in tension with the previous BICEP-Keck (BK) measurements. Our analysis uses the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra, with theoretically motivated priors, on the multifrequency SPT likelihoods complemented by the latest Planck satellite data products. The SPT measurements provide 1.0 bit of information gain on the first slow-roll parameter, which is higher than the 0.9 bit provided by BK even though the SPT sensitivity is five times lower. Moreover, the Bayesian dimensionality on the same parameter exceeds 1.5 for SPT versus 0.3 for BK showing that it is overconstrained by the SPT data. Even if this BB-tension could be the result of a yet to be understood foreground, our findings should motivate for a closer analysis of this unexpected B-modes excess.",
Cross submissions,ArgoLOOM: agentic AI for fundamental physics from quarks to cosmos,"S. D. Bakshi,P. Barry,C. Bissolotti,I. Cloet,S. Corrodi,Z. Djurcic,S. Habib,K. Heitmann,T. J. Hobbs,W. Hopkins,S. Joosten,B. Kriesten,N. Ramachandra,A. Wells,M. Zurek",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"Progress in modern physics has been supported by a steadily expanding corpus of numerical analyses and computational frameworks, which in turn form the basis for precision calculations and baseline predictions in experimental programs. These tools play a central role in navigating a complex landscape of theoretical models and current and potential observables to identify and understand fundamental interactions in physics. In addition, efforts to search for new fundamental interactions increasingly have a cross-disciplinary nature, such that understanding and leveraging interoperabilities among computational tools may be a significant enhancement. This work presents a new agentic AI framework, which we call ArgoLOOM, designed to bridge methodologies and computational analyses across cosmology, collider physics, and nuclear science. We describe the system contours, key internal aspects, and outline its potential for unifying scientific discovery pipelines. In the process, we demonstrate the use of ArgoLOOM on two small-scale problems to illustrate its conceptual foundations and potential for extensibility into a steadily growing agentic framework for fundamental physics.",
Cross submissions,A Limit on the Total Lepton Number in the Universe from BBN and the CMB,"Valerie Domcke,Miguel Escudero,Mario Fernandez Navarro,Stefan Sandner",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"At temperatures below the QCD phase transition, any substantial lepton number in the Universe can only be present within the neutrino sector. In this work, we systematically explore the impact of a non-vanishing lepton number on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Relying on our recently developed framework based on momentum averaged quantum kinetic equations for the neutrino density matrix, we solve the full BBN reaction network to obtain the abundances of primordial elements. We find that the maximal primordial total lepton number $L$ allowed by BBN and the CMB is $-0.12 \,(-0.10) \leq L \leq 0.13\,(0.12) $ for NH (IH), while specific flavor directions can be even more constrained. This bound is complementary to the limits obtained from avoiding baryon overproduction through sphaleron processes at the electroweak phase transition since, although numerically weaker, it applies at lower temperatures and is obtained completely independently. We publicly release the C++ code COFLASY-C on GitHub which solves for the evolution of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations numerically.",
Cross submissions,Missing Beats: Dark Matter Silences Short-Period Cepheids in the Galactic Center,"Djuna Croon,Tim Linden,Jeremy Sakstein",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Upcoming near-infrared facilities (e.g., JWST/NIRCam, ELT/MICADO) will dramatically increase the detectability of galactic center Cepheids despite extreme extinction at optical wavelengths. In this work, we study the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on Cepheid stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way. We show that at densities $\rho \sim 10^5 \, \text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$, blue-loop evolution can be suppressed, preventing the formation of low-mass ($3$-$6 \, M_\odot$) short-period ($1$-$6$ days) Cepheids. A dearth of such variables could provide indirect evidence for DM heating. Notably, this effect occurs at lower DM densities than required to impact main-sequence stars. Future surveys will thus offer a novel, complementary probe of DM properties in galactic nuclei.",
Cross submissions,Suppression of scalar perturbations due to a heavy axion,"Kai-Ge Zhang,Jian-Feng He,Chengjie Fu,Zong-Kuan Guo",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to gauge fields via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta during inflation. The amplified gauge fields act as a source for both scalar and tensor perturbations. In this work, we propose a mechanism for suppressing scalar perturbations while sourcing strong tensor perturbations. We present an implementation of such a mechanism, demonstrating that sourced tensor perturbations are expected to be detected by upcoming next-generation CMB experiments.",
