"The isotropy, anisotropies and non-Gaussianity of the scalar-induced gravitational-wave background: diagrammatic approach for primordial non-Gaussianity up to any order","Jun-Peng Li,Sai Wang,Zhi-Chao Zhao,Kazunori Kohri",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) produced nonlinearly by the enhanced cosmological curvature perturbations can serve as a potentially powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in the early Universe. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the imprints of local-type PNG on the SIGW background beyond the widely used quadratic and cubic approximations. We develop a diagrammatic approach capable of analyzing SIGWs for PNG up to any order. Utilizing this approach, we derive semi-analytic formulas for the energy-density fraction spectrum of the isotropic background, the angular power spectrum of the energy-density anisotropies, as well as the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of the energy-density non-Gaussianity. Specializing to PNG up to quartic approximation (parameterized by $f_\mathrm{NL}$, $g_\mathrm{NL}$, and $h_\mathrm{NL}$), we numerically compute all contributions to these SIGW spectra. We find that PNG can significantly alter the amplitude of the energy-density spectrum and generate substantial anisotropies through the initial inhomogeneities. Furthermore, we observe that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum always vanish when the primordial curvature perturbations are Gaussian; otherwise, they do not, indicating their potential utility as probes of PNG. Therefore, we anticipate that both the isotropic background and the anisotropies of the SIGW background will provide essential information about the early Universe.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16820
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Graviweak Theory,"Stephon Alexander,Bruno Alexandre,João Magueijo,Max Pezzelle",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Graviweak theory seeks to unify gravity (specifically in its self-dual formulation) with the weak interaction, preying on their parallel chiral $SU(2)$ structures. In this paper we further this idea by folding it with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We do this first with a standard Higgs field and potential, starting with a unifying parity-invariant theory which splits into the usual gravity and weak sector under spontaneous symmetry breaking. By rewriting the theory in the two-spin framework we are then prompted to discuss generalizations, within the generic approach known as MacDowell-Mansouri theories where a larger internal gauge group is broken. One of the predictions of the ensuing construction is a non-minimal coupling in the low energy broken phase between curvature and the weak gauge fields, translating at the quantum level to a direct channel between the graviton and the weak bosons.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17935

They are ideal testbeds for various fundamental physical processes under extreme conditions that are unique in nature. Observational radio astronomy with uGMRT and OORT facilities has led to several important breakthroughs in studies of different kinds of pulsars and their emission mechanisms. On the other hand, accretion processes around compact objects are at the core of Indian astronomy research. In this context, AstroSat mission revolutionized spectro-temporal observations and measurements of accretion phenomena, quasi-periodic oscillations, and jet behaviour in binary systems hosting compact objects. Moreover, recently launched XPoSat mission is set to provide an impetus to these high-energy phenomena around compact objects by enabling us to conduct polarization measurements in the X-ray band. Further, during the past decade, numerous gravitational wave signals have been observed from coalescing black holes and neutron stars in binary systems. Recent simultaneous observation of the GW170817 event in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic channels has ushered in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. In the future, synergistic efforts among several world-class observational facilities, e.g., LIGO-India, SKA, TMT, etc., within the Indian astrophysics community will provide a significant boost to achieve several key science goals that have been delineated here. In general, this article plans to highlight scientific projects being pursued across Indian institutions in this field, the scientific challenges that this community would be focusing on, and the opportunities in the coming decade. Finally, we have also mentioned the required resources, both in the form of infrastructural and human resources.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18238
Dynamical Evolutions in Globular Clusters and Dwarf Galaxies: Conduction Fluid Simulations,"Yi-Ming Zhong,Stuart L. Shapiro",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present a new two-fluid conduction scheme to simulate the evolution of an isolated, self-gravitating, equilibrium cluster of stars and collisionless dark matter on secular (gravothermal) timescales. We integrate the equations in Lagrangian coordinates via a second-order, semi-implicit algorithm, which is unconditionally stable when the mass of the lighter species is much less than that of the heavier species. The method can be straightforwardly generalized to handle a multi-species system with a population of stars or components beyond collisionless dark matter and stars. We apply the method to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar-dark matter systems, exploring the consequences of mass segregation and gravothermal core collapse, and assessing those effects for observed globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18251
Dynamical Dark Energy at Late Time $Λ$CDM,"J. W. Moffat,E. J. Thompson","Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)","We investigate the dynamical properties of dark energy through a detailed analysis of its equation of state parameter $w(z)$ as a function of redshift. We derive a general expression for $w(z)$ from the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, establishing a direct relationship between the dark energy equation of state and the observable Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivative. Using the relation $w(z) = -1 + \frac{2(1+z)}{3H(z)} \frac{dH}{dz}$, we develop an approximation method valid for $z \lesssim 1$ that accounts for the changing balance between matter and dark energy contributions to cosmic expansion. We compare our theoretical framework with recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2, analysing how well the commonly used Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = -1 + w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$ captures the evolution of dark energy. Our results indicate that the dark energy equation of state exhibits a monotonic evolution with redshift, transitioning from deceleration to acceleration around $z \approx 0.7$. Notably, our predicted $w_{\mathrm{DE}}$ remains greater than $-1$ across all redshifts, avoiding phantom energy scenarios that would violate the null energy condition. This work demonstrates how precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history can constrain the nature of dark energy and provides a framework for testing dynamical dark energy models against current and future cosmological observations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18900
Examining Quintessence Models with DESI Data,"Zahra Bayat,Mark P. Hertzberg",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We examine data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration which has implications for the nature of dark energy. We consider classes of models that manifestly obey the null energy condition, with a focus on quintessence models. We find that hilltop potentials and exponential potentials provide modest improvement compared to a cosmological constant, but the statistical evidence is only marginal at this stage. We correct some analyses in the existing literature which attempted to compare some quintessence models to the data, giving an overly positive result.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18937
On the Pipeline Dependence of DESI Dynamical Dark Energy,"Eoin Ó Colgáin,Saeed Pourojaghi,M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline. Concretely, we define a likelihood that converts the $w_0 w_a$CDM model back into the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which we fit to DESI constraints on the flat $\Lambda$CDM model from DR1 Full-Shape (FS) modelling and BAO. We further incorporate CMB constraints. Throughout, we find that $w_0$ and $w_a$ are within $1 \sigma$ of the flat $\Lambda$CDM Model. Our work makes it explicit that, in contrast to DR1 and DR2 BAO, there is no dynamical DE signal in FS modelling, even when combined with BAO and CMB. Moreover, one confirms late-time accelerated expansion today $(q_0 < 0)$ at $ \gtrsim 3.4 \sigma$ in FS modelling+BAO. On the contrary, DR1 and DR2 BAO fail to confirm $q_0 < 0$ under similar assumptions. Our analyses highlight the fact that trustable scientific results should be independent of the analysis pipeline.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19029
Testing cosmological principle under Copernican principle,"Xin Wang,Zhiqi Huang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent observational analyses have revealed potential evidence for a preferred spatial direction in cosmological data. Such directional parameterization inherently places observers at a privileged spatial position, thereby conflicting with the Copernican principle and suffering from the look-elsewhere effect. To restore the Copernican principle which is the foundation of modern astronomy, we propose a stochastic framework for cosmological principle violations. The almost uniform temperature of cosmic microwave background suggests that the deviation of isotropy is negligible ($\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface, which can be used as a zero boundary condition to construct an orthogonal basis below the redshift of recombination. The relative deviation from Hubble diagram of isotropic ($\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) models is expanded with the orthogonal basis with a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Using this new approach, we test cosmological principle with type Ia supernovae, strong lens time delay, and gravitational-wave standard siren. The data sets are consistent with statistical isotropy on large scales.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19055
Geometric Determinations Of Characteristic Redshifts From DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR Observations: Hints For New Expansion Rate Anomalies,"Purba Mukherjee,Anjan A Sen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Machine Learning (cs.LG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we perform a model-agnostic reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history by combining DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR data, with a focus on geometric determination of characteristic redshifts where notable tensions in the expansion rate are found to emerge. Employing Gaussian process regression alongside knot-based spline techniques, we reconstruct cosmic distances and their derivatives to pinpoint these characteristic redshifts and infer $E(z)$. Our analysis reveals significant deviations of approximately 4 to 5$\sigma$ from the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the redshift range $z \sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust late-time departures that could signal new physics beyond the standard cosmological framework. The joint use of BAO and SN probes enhances the precision of our constraints, allowing us to isolate these deviations without reliance on specific cosmological assumptions. Our findings underscore the role of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO, Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and help distinguish whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental physics or unresolved systematics in the data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19083
Probing dipolar power asymmetry with galaxy clustering and intrinsic alignments,"Keita Minato,Atsushi Taruya,Teppei Okumura,Maresuke Shiraishi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the prospects for probing large-scale statistical anisotropy through galaxy clustering and intrinsic alignments (IA) in Stage IV galaxy surveys. Specifically, we consider a dipolar modulation in the primordial power spectrum and evaluate the Fisher information matrix using the two-point statistics of both the galaxy clustering and IA. Our analysis reveals that while IA alone provides limited improvement in constraining the anisotropy amplitude, the cross-spectrum between galaxy density and IA can contribute up to half the constraining power of galaxy clustering, especially for surveys with low galaxy bias and high number density of galaxies, such as Euclid. This demonstrates the potential of IA-clustering cross-correlations as a robust consistency check against systematics, and highlights the complementary roles of galaxy clustering and IA in constraining cosmic statistical anisotropy. We also show that marginalizing over galaxy bias and IA bias parameters has a negligible impact on the final constraint on the anisotropy amplitude.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19941
Ultra-Planckian Quark and Gluon Scattering in Agravity,"I. F. Cunha,A. C. Lehum",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate tree-level scattering processes involving quarks and gluons mediated by graviton exchange in the framework of Agravity, a dimensionless and renormalizable theory of quadratic quantum gravity. Focusing on the ultra-Planckian regime, we compute the squared amplitudes and analyze the differential cross sections for the processes $gg \rightarrow gg$, $gg \rightarrow q\bar{q}$, $gq \rightarrow gq$, and $qq \rightarrow qq$. We demonstrate that all amplitudes scale as $1/s$ at high energies, in agreement with expectations for a UV-complete theory of gravity. In addition, we explore the issue of unitarity in the presence of higher-derivative ghost modes by analyzing the positivity properties of the squared amplitudes. While IR divergences appear in the forward scattering of massless particles, we show that these are regularized by finite quark masses. Our findings support the viability of Agravity as a perturbatively unitary and UV-complete extension of general relativity, capable of consistently describing gravitational interactions among elementary matter fields at trans-Planckian energies.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19957
Estimating the binary neutron star merger rate density evolution with Einstein Telescope,"Neha Singh,Tomasz Bulik,Aleksandra Olejak",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Einstein Telescope (ET) is a proposed third-generation, wide-band gravitational wave (GW) detector which will have an improved detection sensitivity in low frequencies, leading to a longer observation time in the detection band and higher detection rate for binary neutron stars (BNSs). Despite the fact that ET will have a higher detection rate, a large fraction of BNSs will remain undetectable. We present a scheme to estimate accurate detection efficiency and to reconstruct the true merger rate density of the population of the BNSs, as a function of redshift. We show that with ET as a single instrumnet, for a population of BNSs with $R_{mer} \sim 100 (300)$ $\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ at $z\sim 0(2)$, we can reconstruct the merger rate density uptil $z \sim 2$ , with a relative error of $12\%$ at ($z \sim 2$), despite the loss in detection of the bulk of the BNS population.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19962
Area-charge inequality and local rigidity in charged initial data sets,Abraão Mendes,Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper investigates the geometric consequences of equality in area-charge inequalities for spherical minimal surfaces and, more generally, for marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS), within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. We show that, under appropriate energy and curvature conditions, saturation of the inequality $\mathcal{A} \geq 4\pi(\mathcal{Q}_{\rm E}^2 + \mathcal{Q}_{\rm M}^2)$ imposes a rigid geometric structure in a neighborhood of the surface. In particular, the electric and magnetic fields must be normal to the foliation, and the local geometry is isometric to a Riemannian product. We establish two main rigidity theorems: one in the time-symmetric case and another for initial data sets that are not necessarily time-symmetric. In both cases, equality in the area-charge bound leads to a precise characterization of the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the initial data near the critical surface.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20060
Notes on Rindler wave packets in Minkowski spacetime,"Shono Shibuya,Sotaro Sugishita",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider wave packets of a massless scalar field that have well-localized Rindler energy, and examine how their energy appears to a Minkowski observer to see how the classical gravitational blue-shift formula is modified quantum mechanically. We derive, by using the saddle point approximation, an analytic expression for the Minkowski momentum distribution of such Rindler wave packets. We find a universal lower bound on the uncertainty of Minkowski momentum; the momentum distribution can never become arbitrarily sharp.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20078

Building on previous versions, Kira 3 introduces optimized seeding and equation selection algorithms, significantly improving performance for multi-loop and multi-scale problems. New features include convenient numerical sampling, symbolic integration-by-parts reductions, and support for user-defined additional relations. We demonstrate its capabilities through benchmarks on two- and three-loop topologies, showcasing up to two orders of magnitude improvement over Kira 2.3.

First-order hyperbolic formulation of the pure tetrad teleparallel gravity theory,"Ilya Peshkov,Héctor Olivares,Evgeniy Romenski",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Driven by the need for numerical solutions to the Einstein field equations,we derive a first-order reduction of the second-order $ f(T) $-teleparallelgravity equations in the pure-tetrad formulation (no spin connection). Wethen restrict our attention to the teleparallel equivalent of generalrelativity (TEGR) and propose a 3+1 decomposition of these equationssuitable for computational implementation. We demonstrate that in vacuum(matter-free spacetime) the obtained system of first-order equations isequivalent to the tetrad reformulation of general relativity by Estabrook,Robinson, Wahlquist, and Buchman and Bardeen, and therefore also admits asymmetric hyperbolic formulation. However, the question of hyperbolicity ofthe 3+1 TEGR equations for arbitrary spacetimes remains unaddressed so far.Furthermore, the structure of the 3+1 equations resembles a lot ofsimilarities with the equations of relativistic electrodynamics and therecently proposed dGREM tetrad-reformulation of general relativity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13659
Modified Kerr black holes surrounded by dark matter spike,"Salvatore Capozziello,Soroush Zare,Luis M. Nieto,Hassan Hassanabadi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We study supermassive black holes (SMBH), surrounded by a dark matter (DM) spike, that can be found at the centers of Milky Way and $\text{M87}$ galaxies and are accompanied by a specific kind of topological defect. The investigation is developed within the framework of Bumblebee Gravity with a global monopole (BGGM). The dark matter spike is described by a power-law density profile. Our main objective is to assess how the background arising from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking and the presence of a global monopole influence the properties of the Kerr BH within the region affected by the spike. Using a spherically symmetric static BH with BGGM properties as the seed metric, we construct a non-rotating spacetime with a DM spike, resulting in a BGGM-motivated Schwarzschild-like BH by solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations (TOV). Next, we extend this approach to the case of a rotating spacetime resulting in the BGGM-motivated Kerr-like BH (BGMKLBH). This approach allows us to explore the spacetime structure, and the BGMKLBH shadows. Then, using available observational data for the DM spike density and considering the effects of BGGM on $\text{Sgr A}^{*}$ and $\text{M87}^{*}$ SMBHs, we analyse the shapes of their shadows and put constraints on the BGGM parameter. Thus, we infer that the BGMKLBHs could be reliable candidates for the astrophysical BHs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12896
On the past maximal development of near-FLRW data for the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system,"David Fajman,Liam Urban",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"We show that the maximal globally hyperbolic development of near-FLRW initial data for the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system exhibits stable Big Bang formation in the collapsing direction. The solutions exhibit stable Kretschmann scalar blow-up, causing the spacetime to become causally geodesically past incomplete, and are asymptotically velocity term dominated. This is the first stability result for the Einstein equations in the collapsing spacetime direction in presence of Vlasov matter that does not rely on any symmetry assumptions. Furthermore, the Vlasov distribution remains close to that of the FLRW solution as a function on the co-mass shell, and so does its momentum support if one assumes it to be close to that of the FLRW distribution initially. On the other hand, the leading order terms in components of the Vlasov energy-momentum tensor exbihit an offset in asymptotic order controlled by the perturbation size, and when viewed on the mass shell, the distribution asymptotically concentrates in certain preferred velocity directions. To ensure that this behaviour is sufficiently mitigated by the scalar field, we crucially exploit a scaling hierarchy between horizontal and vertical derivatives in the commuted Vlasov equation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08544
Gravitational-wave effects in the most general vector-tensor theory,"Yu-Qi Dong,Xiao-Bin Lai,Yu-Qiang Liu,Yu-Xiao Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we establish a model-independent framework based on the Isaacson picture to analyze the gravitational-wave effects in the most general vector-tensor theory that yields second-order field equations. Within this framework, we derive two basic sets of equations for the Isaacson picture. These equations enable the analysis of gravitational wave polarization modes, the dispersion relation of each mode, the effective energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves, and the memory effects. These features are closely tied to observable phenomena and have attracted considerable attention. They are expected to be detected by the next generation of gravitational wave observatories designed to test potential modifications to general relativity. Using this framework, we present the explicit expression for the effective energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves in the most general second-order vector-tensor theory and perform a complete analysis of their polarization modes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11838
Search for continuous gravitational waves from unknown neutron stars in binary systems with long orbital periods in O3 data,"P. B. Covas,M. A. Papa,R. Prix",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves emitted by asymmetric rotating neutron stars are the primary targets of continuous gravitational-wave searches. Neutron stars in binary systems are particularly interesting due to the potential for non-axisymmetric deformations induced by a companion star. However, all-sky searches for unknown neutron stars in binary systems are very computationally expensive and this limits their sensitivity and/or breadth. In this paper we present results of a search for signals with gravitational-wave frequencies between $50$ and $150$~Hz, from systems with orbital periods between $100$ and $1\,000$ days and projected semi-major axes between $40$ and $200$~light-seconds. This parameter-space region has never been directly searched before. We do not detect any signal, and our results exclude gravitational-wave amplitudes above $1.25 \times 10^{-25}$ at $144.32$~Hz with $95\%$ confidence. Our improved search pipeline is more sensitive than any previous all-sky binary search by about $75\%$.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16196

This extension elucidates the dynamics of the system and demonstrates how it can encompass and recover previous cosmological models through different parameter values. We present the cosmological background equations to analyze self-accelerating solutions that can explain the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, driven by an effective cosmological constant arising from massive gravity. Besides, we apply the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with non-minimal kinetic coupling to a Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data set to test its viability. Our findings indicate that the theory is able to account for the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe without invoking dark energy. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive perturbation analysis examining tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations independently. We derive the dispersion relation of gravitational waves in a Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology and determine the stability conditions of the system. Such an analysis results in a sharper quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with non-minimal kinetic coupling by ensuring the stability conditions of the system are maintained and that strong constraints on theory parameters are provided.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17915
Screen chaotic motion by Shannon entropy in curved spacetimes,"Wenfu Cao,Yang Huang,Hongsheng Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We find a novel characteristic for chaotic motion by introducing Shannon entropy for periodic orbits, quasiperiodic orbits, and chaoticthis http URLcompare our approach with the previous methods including Poincaré Section, Lyapunov exponent, Fast Lyapunov Indicator, Recurrence plots(Rps), and Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) for orbits around black hole immersed in magnetic fields, and show that they agree with each other quite well. The approach of Shannon entropy is intuitively clear, and theoretically reasonable since it becomes larger and larger form a periodic orbit to chaotic orbit. We demonstrate that Shannon entropy can be a powerful probe to distinguish between chaotic and regular orbits in different spacetimes, and reversely may lead to a new road to define the entropy for a single orbit in phase space, and to find more fundamental relations between thermodynamics and dynamics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20870

Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators,"Konstantinos Dialektopoulos,Theodoros Papanikolaou,Vasilios Zarikas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, Bardeen and Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m<5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 < \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}< 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18352
On the cosmological degrees of freedom of Proca field with non-minimal coupling to gravity,"Antonio De Felice,Anamaria Hell",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity through the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar interactions. We show that in the homogeneous and isotropic Universe together with cosmological constant, the temporal component of the vector field acquires a background value. As a result, we show that the theory propagates an additional degree of freedom, with respect to the generalized Proca theories, whose kinetic term suggests the presence of several strong coupling regimes that depend on the value of the background solution, the combination and vanishing of coupling constants, together with a scale-dependent one. We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling. In addition, we discover a mode with scale-dependent strong coupling (vanishing kinetic term), one mode that propagates only in one single direction and two unstable modes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07454
Pseudospectrum of rotating analog black holes,"Lucas Tobias de Paula,Pedro Henrique Croti Siqueira,Rodrigo Panosso Macedo,Maurício Richartz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Analyzing the stability of quasinormal modes (QNM) is essential for understanding black hole dynamics, particularly in the context of gravitational wave emissions and black hole spectroscopy. In this study, we employ the hyperboloidal approach to reformulate the quasinormal mode problem of a rotating analog black hole, effectively transforming it into an eigenvalue problem associated with a nonself-adjoint operator. Using this method, we examine the influence of rotation on the stability of the QNM spectrum, relying on the associated pseudospectrum for qualitative assessment. Our findings indicate that the prograde overtones become more stable as rotation increases. This work enhances our understanding of spectrum stability in rotating systems and expands the study of pseudospectra in non-spherically symmetric spacetimes, with potential for empirical testing in terrestrial laboratories.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00106

Consistency relations between multimessenger and large scale structure observations,Antonio Enea Romano,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a unified model independent theoretical framework to study the effects of dark energy and modified gravity. We show that applying the EFT to Horndeski theories it is possible to derive consistency relations (CR) between physically observable quantities, valid for different classes of theories defined by the brading parameter behavior, while leaving the other property functions free. As expected, the CRs are also valid for general relativity, and relate the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity distances and the speed of gravitational waves (GW). We apply the CRs to map the large scale structure observational constraints on the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter to GW-EMW distance ratio constraints. The CRs allow to probe the value of the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter with multimessenger observations, independently from large scale structure observations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04574
Hodge Dual Gauge Symmetry in Minimal Einstein-Aether Theory,Kamal Hajian,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Einstein-aether gravity is a theory that breaks the local Lorentz symmetry by introducing a preferred direction via a vector field, which is considered to play the role of an aether. The theory is identified by four coupling constants between the aether and gravity. Minimal Einstein-aether is the special case in which only one of the couplings is non-zero. We show that the aether vector field in its minimal version is Hodge dual to a gauge field. The gauge symmetry in the dual description has been known for decades and has been used to implement a cosmological constant into the Lagrangian. As a result, solutions to the well-established gauge theory can be transferred into the minimal Einstein-aether theory straightforwardly. On the other hand, some of the proposed solutions to the minimal Einstein-aether theory could be discarded as pure gauges of the vanishing aether. We prove as a theorem that this holds true for all divergence-less aether fields.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12641
"Black Hole Thermodynamics in Harada's inspired theory of gravity: Stability, Phase Structure and Geometrothermodynamics","S. Ghaffari,G. G. Luciano",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of spherically symmetric, static black hole solutions within the framework of Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG). This is a modified theory of gravity that retains all solutions of General Relativity, while addressing some of its theoretical shortcomings and enriching gravitational phenomenology at large distances. We derive key thermodynamic quantities, including mass, temperature, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy, to examine the stability and phase structure of extended Schwarzschild-AdS and charged AdS black holes. Furthermore, employing the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we analyze the behavior of the thermodynamic curvature scalar to identify critical points and characterize phase transitions. Our results demonstrate that the parameter \( \lambda \), which quantifies deviations from Einstein's theory, plays a pivotal role in shaping the thermodynamic behavior, resulting in new stability conditions and distinct phase transition patterns compared to those predicted by standard General Relativity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06560
Gravitational lensing of the wormhole in the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld spacetime with a cosmic string,"Xin-Fei Li,Lei-Hua Liu,Yan-Zhi Meng,Shu-Qing Zhong,Li-Juan Zhou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work we study gravitational lensing of the wormhole in the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) spacetime that incorporates with a cosmic string. It was found that the presence of cosmic string can enhance the light deflection in strong field limit, compared to the case of the Eills-Bronnikov wormhole. The magnification effects of this composite structure could cause some substantial impacts on the angle separation between the first and the rest of the images, and their relative brightness. Furthermore, based on these observables, we model some observable aspects in the strong and the weak field limits. The presence of a cosmic string can affect some distinguishable observables compared to the wormhole without cosmic string. This work could deepen our understanding of the spacetime structure of the wormhole in EiBI spacetime with one-dimensional topological defects.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07420
Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT results,"Andrea Addazi,Yermek Aldabergenov,Sergei V. Ketov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_s$, its running index $\alpha_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10305
Light deflection and gravitational lensing effects in acoustic black-bounce spacetime,"C. F. S. Pereira,A. R. Soares,M. V. de S. Silva,R. L. L. Vitória,H. Belich",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the present work, we analyze the gravitational deflection for a light beam in the weak and strong field regimes for the gravitational analogue geometry of an acoustic black hole (ABH) and acoustic black-bounce (ABB). Motivationally, the first spacetime arises as an exact solution of the field equations for gravitational black holes (BHs) in an Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory (EsGB) \cite{3}. In contrast, the second model arises from the combination of phantom scalar field and nonlinear electrodynamics in general relativity (GR) \cite{INTRO24}. We construct analytical expressions for the angular deflection of light in both limits and, from them, analyze the construction of the observables, which allow us to relate theoretical models to observational data. We compare these observables and show how much they differ from those obtained in the Schwarzschild solution.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12577
Torsional Effects in the Coupling between Gravity and Spinors -- Yukawa Gravity,Elisa Varani,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study spinors in the framework of general relativity, starting from the Dirac field Lagrangian in the approximation of weak gravity. We focus on how fermions couple to gravity through the spin connection, and we analyze these couplings by analogy with the Ginzburg-Landau model and the Yukawa interaction known from the Higgs mechanism. By solving the field equations, we explore how these couplings affect the spacetime metric. In particular, torsion generated by fermionic spin currents naturally emerges and leads to the breaking of Lorentz symmetry. As a consequence, gravity acquires a mass and fermions gain additional mass contributions through their interaction with this gravitational field. These effects are localized and diminish quickly with distance. Our model offers an alternative explanation to phenomena usually attributed to dark matter and dark energy. We link these cosmological effects to chirality-flip processes of Majorana neutrinos interacting with a massive graviton. Right-handed Majorana neutrinos, which are sterile under Standard Model interactions, generate repulsive gravitational curvature and act as a source of dark energy, while left-handed neutrinos contribute to attractive gravitational effects akin to dark matter. The spin-gravity coupling modifies the curvature of spacetime, influencing galaxy rotation, the accelerated expansion of the universe, and the bending of light. In short, the intrinsic spin of fermions, when coupled to gravity via torsion, changes gravity from a long-range, massless force to a short-range, massive one. This new framework provides fresh insights into fundamental physics and cosmology, potentially explaining dark matter and dark energy phenomena through spin-related gravitational effects.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17158
Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow and foliations of initial data sets,Jacopo Tenan,Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math., 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12971
Classical Observables from Causal Response Functions,"Shovon Biswas,Julio Parra-Martinez",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We revisit the calculation of classical observables from causal response functions, following up on recent work by Caron-Huot at al. [JHEP 01 (2024) 139]. We derive a formula to compute asymptotic in-in observables from a particular soft limit of five-point amputated response functions. Using such formula, we re-derive the formulas by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC) for the linear impulse and radiated linear momentum of particles undergoing scattering, and we present an unambiguous calculation of the radiated angular momentum at leading order. Then, we explore the consequences of manifestly causal Feynman rules in the calculation of classical observables by employing the causal (Keldysh) basis in the in-in formalism. We compute the linear impulse, radiated waveform and its variance at leading and/or next-to-leading order in the causal basis, and find that all terms singular in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit cancel manifestly at the integrand level. We also find that the calculations simplify considerably and classical properties such as factorization of six-point amplitudes are more transparent in the causal basis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09016
Observable Primordial Gravitational Waves from Non-minimally Coupled $R^2$ Palatini Modified Gravity,"Hardik Jitendra Kuralkar,Sukanta Panda,Archit Vidyarthi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We probe the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) produced during the eras of hyperkination, kination, and reheating in a non-minimally coupled, $\mathcal{L} \propto (1+ \xi \chi /M_{\text{Pl}})^t (R+\alpha R^2)$, modified gravity using the Palatini formulation. We consider a runaway potential, which gives an era of kinetic domination after the end of inflation. The coupling order $t$ is varied to examine a large class of theories up to $\chi^2 R^2$. For models with $t>0$, reheating is not achieved naturally; hence, we supplement such theories with a reheating mechanism based on the interaction of inflaton and radiation produced at the end of inflation due to cosmological expansion. We demonstrate that the energy density of the GWs is enhanced as a function of the coupling during kination for all considered theories, and a short-lived phase of hyperkination truncates the boost and avoids the over-production of GWs. Hyperkination, and thus the $R^2$ term, should be deemed necessary in all theories with a runaway potential as it prevents the GW enhancement during kination from destabilizing the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The spectrum remains flat for the period of hyperkination and reheating. We examine the available parameter space for which the theories remain valid and place bounds on the Hubble parameter ($H$) and radiation energy density ($\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$) at the end of inflation. We find that as we decrease the order of the coupling, the spectra shift towards a more observable regime of future GW experiments. The observation of the plateau during reheating will constrain the $H$ and $\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$ values, while the spectral shape of the boost obtained during kination will confirm the nature of the theory. The bounds from hyperkination lie in the kHz-GHz frequency range.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03573
Quantization of Carrollian fermions,"Ertuğrul Ekiz,Emre Onur Kahya,Utku Zorba",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We provide the first example of interacting quantized Carrollian Dirac fermions and investigate their discrete symmetries, including charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) transformations. As a toy model, we couple these fermions to a Carrollian scalar field using Carrollian Yukawa theory and compute the tree-level diagram, revealing an ultralocal interaction between the Carrollian fermions and the scalar field. This interaction, widely known as a Dirac delta interaction with time-dependent factor, frequently appears in quantum physics. We then address the renormalization of the theory by employing the Wilsonian procedure at one-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the fixed points and stability properties of Carrollian Yukawa theory, comparing them with their relativistic counterparts. Beyond the specific Yukawa model studied here, we expect that our framework will have broader applications in Carrollian physics, particularly in understanding ultralocal interactions and their role in condensed matter systems, where similar phenomena arise in strongly correlated and non-relativistic regimes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05645

Dynamical Dark Energy Emerges from Massive Gravity,Juri Smirnov,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $4.0 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 3$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03870
Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables,Farrukh A. Chishtie,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.05221 \pm 0.0007$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence with a closed-form solution. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001\,159\,652\,180\,61(76))$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09947
What Price Fiber Bundle Substantivalism?

After reviewing the essentials of this framework, we articulate the generalized hole and point-coincidence arguments, examining how they weight on a substantivalist position towards bundle spaces. This question, then, is considered in light of the Dressing Field Method, which allows a manifestly invariant reformulation of gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories, making their conceptual structure more transparent: it formally implements the point-coincidence argument and thus allows to define (dressed) fields and (dressed) bundle spaces immune to hole-type arguments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12876

A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13420

We show that the problem arises from the assumption $\mu=p$ ($\mu$ is a renormalization point) and that a suitable choice of $\mu$ gives the correct running. It is also claimed that neither the cosmological constant nor Newton coupling run. We argue that running can be discussed when we consider the curved spacetime.,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16578
