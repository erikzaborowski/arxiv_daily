New submissions,Causal Viscous Fluids and Non-Singular Cosmological Bounces,"L. Yildiz,D. Kayki,E. Gudekli",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the realization of non-singular bouncing cosmologies driven by causal bulk-viscous fluids within General Relativity, $f(R)$ gravity, and Loop Quantum Cosmology. Building on the no-go result of Eckart theory in spatially flat universes, we show that the Israel--Stewart formulation, which incorporates finite relaxation times, permits controlled violations of the null energy condition at the bounce while remaining consistent with thermodynamic and causality requirements. Analytical bounce solutions are constructed from parametrized scale factors, yielding explicit constraints on the viscosity coefficient and relaxation time that guarantee positive entropy production and stable perturbations. In extended gravity frameworks, we demonstrate that higher-curvature corrections in $f(R)$ models and quantum geometry effects in Loop Quantum Cosmology further enhance the robustness of viscous bounces. Our results establish a unified description in which bulk viscosity provides a physically consistent mechanism for singularity resolution across different theories of gravity, highlighting distinctive conditions under which smooth cosmological bounces can occur.",
New submissions,Towards a few percent measurement of the Hubble constant with the current network of gravitational wave detectors without using electromagnetic information,"Tom Bertheas,Vasco Gennari,Nicola Tamanini",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves provide a novel and independent measurement of cosmological parameters, offering a promising avenue to address the Hubble tension alongside traditional electromagnetic observations. In the absence of electromagnetic counterparts or complete host galaxy catalogs, current measurements rely on population-based methods that statistically combine black hole merger events. Building on recent models that incorporate additional structure in the primary black hole mass distribution, using public data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration third observing run (O3), we obtain a 30% accuracy improvement on the measurement of the Hubble constant with respect to the result reported by LVK. Employing a realistic simulation that includes full Bayesian single-event inference, we present forecasts for the upcoming LVK observational runs, O4 and O5. Using a three power-law mass model, we project a measurement of the Hubble constant with 20% accuracy at O4 sensitivity, improving to 2.7% accuracy at O5 sensitivity. Our findings demonstrate the potential for gravitational waves to provide a substantial contribution to solving the Hubble tension within the next decade of observations.",
New submissions,Lensing by black holes within astrophysical environments,"Gerasimos Kouniatalis,Arthur G. Suvorov,Kyriakos Destounis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of matter in the form of disks or halos. While a number of studies have examined the impact of an environment on the lensing of light or gravitational waves from cosmological sources, these have, thus far, been carried out in either a Newtonian or post-Newtonian framework where the environment is superimposed on the black-hole spacetime. By using an exact solution in general relativity describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully relativistic setup. It is shown that large ``bumps'' corresponding to the peak of the mass distribution can significantly adjust the inferences made for either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider ``echoes'' of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.",
New submissions,Conformal Weyl Tensor Dynamics and Stability Analysis in Rotating Black Hole Spacetimes: A Novel Approach to Quasinormal Mode Spectra,Nader Haddad,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a novel theoretical framework for analysing the stability of rotating black hole spacetimes through the conformal properties of the Weyl tensor. By introducing a new conformal invariant constructed from the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor, we derive a master equation governing perturbations that unifies the Teukolsky and Regge-Wheeler- Zerilli formalisms. Our approach reveals previously unrecognised relationships between quasinormal mode frequencies and the conformal structure of thethis http URLprove two fundamental theorems: (i) the conformal stability criterion, which relates mode stability to the sign-definiteness of our conformal invariant, and (ii) the isospectrality theorem for conformally related black hole spacetimes. Numerical calculations for Kerr black holes demonstrate that our formalism predicts new branches in the quasinormal mode spectrum, with frequencies differing from standard predictions by up to 3.7% in the near-extremal regime. These results have significant implications for gravitational wave astronomy and tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime.",
New submissions,Observational bounds on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars from Gravitational Wave Data,"Rafael M. Santos,Rafael C. Nunes,Jaziel G. Coelho,Jose C. N. de Araujo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Recent gravitational-wave (GW) observations offer a unique opportunity to probe the fundamental nature of compact objects. A growing body of research has focused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of DM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly alter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal deformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during binary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that, for the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using real GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115, and GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\chi}$, and particle mass, $m_{\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a scalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on $F_{\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating that different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in different ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM halo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105 and GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding strong upper bounds on $F_{\chi}$. The corresponding values for the mass scale $m_{\chi}$ are also discussed in the text. This work offers a new approach to probing DM in the context of compact NS objects through GW observations.",
New submissions,On the Chen-Teo family of stationary asymptotically locally Minkowskian black holes,"Federico Elizondo Lopez,Hari K. Kunduri,Hakim Temacini",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Chen and Teo have constructed a two-parameter family of five dimensional, stationary vacuum black hole solutions whose spatial hypersurfaces are asymptotically locally Euclidean with boundary at infinity is $L(2,1)$. Spatial cross sections of the event horizon have topology $S^3$ equipped with inhomogeneous metrics. When the mass is zero, the solution reduces to the trivial product of time with the Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instanton. We show that the spacetime metric can be smoothly extended through an event horizon and that the exterior region is stably causal. We also investigate their geometric and physical properties. In particular, we show that the Smarr relation and first law of black hole mechanics hold and compute the renormalized gravitational action.",
New submissions,Search for growing angular modes in ultracompact boson star evolutions,Seppe J. Staelens,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent fully non-linear simulations of ultracompact spherically symmetric boson stars have presented evidence for their long-term stability. All observed dynamics could be mainly attributed to the fundamental radial mode. In this work, we additionally decompose some of the data in spherical harmonics, providing a first step towards the characterization of non-spherical modes present.",
New submissions,Time-periodic solutions of the conformally invariant wave equation on the Einstein cylinder,"Ficek Filip,Maciej Maliborski",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"As a first step in exploring time-periodic solutions of the Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant, we study the cubic conformal wave equation on the Einstein cylinder. Using a combination of numerical and perturbative techniques, we discover that time-periodic solutions form intricate bifurcation patterns.",
New submissions,Coincident morphological transitions in precessing black-hole binaries,"Davide Gerosa,Giulia Foroni,Giulia Fumagalli,Emanuele Berti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present new insights into the phenomenology of post-Newtonian spin precession in black-hole binaries. Using multi-timescale methods, previous work has shown that the precession and nutation dynamics in such systems can be classified into so-called spin morphologies --mutually exclusive regions that partition the configuration space and characterize the motion of the black-hole spins relative to the binary's angular momentum. Radiation reaction can induce secular transitions between different morphology classes, which are generic occurrences during the inspiral of black-hole binaries. In this contribution, we systematically explore a more restrictive class of solutions in which multiple morphological transitions occur concurrently, i.e., within the same precession cycle. We find that all such cases can be mapped and characterized analytically, and we confirm these findings through numerical integrations. These coincident transitions correspond to extreme spin configurations in black-hole binaries with potential observational signatures in gravitational-wave astronomy.",
New submissions,Greybody factors of Proca fields in Schwarzschild spacetime: A supplemental analysis based on decoupled master equations related to the Frolov-Krtouš-Kubizňák-Santos separation,"Supanat Bunjusuwan,Chun-Hung Chen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Greybody factors for Proca fields in Schwarzschild black hole spacetime are investigated. The radial equations are derived by separating the field equations using vector spherical harmonics and decoupling the even-parity sector through Frolov-Krtouš-Kubizňák-Santos transformation in the static limit. Semi-analytical methods, including a rigorous bound and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation, are used to compute the transmission probabilities. In addition to reproducing known results, two distinctive features are identified. In the even-parity vector mode, a low-mass regime is found where the transmission probability exceeds that of the massless case for a set of common energy and angular momentum parameters. In the even-parity scalar mode, the massless limit reproduces the result of massless scalar perturbations and corresponds to a pure gauge mode in Maxwell theory. In the same mode, the transmission probability in the massive case is systematically lower than that of a massive scalar field with the same parameters.",
New submissions,"Gravitational particle production, the cosmological tensions and fast radio bursts",Recai Erdem,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In a previous study I had found that gravitational particle production (to be more specific, gravitational vacuum polarization) results in an effective increase in the directly measured value of the Hubble constant (such as in SN Ia measurements) while it does not affect the value of the Hubble constant derived from energy densities (such as in CMB calculations in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM). It had been pointed out that this may explain why the values of Hubble constant determined from direct and indirect measurements are different. In the present study, first I extend the analysis to the $\sigma_8$ tension, and then to determination of the Hubble constant through observations of fast radio bursts. It is observed that inclusion of the effect of gravitational vacuum polarization essentially does not neither mitigate nor exacerbate the $\sigma_8$ tension (while it mitigates or relieves the Hubble tension). This result may provide a significant progress in the resolution of the Hubble and the $\sigma_8 tensions$ in the light of the studies in literature that question existence of a true $\sigma_8$ tension. Moreover, in this scheme the value of the Hubble constant measured in fast radio bursts $\hat{H}_0$ is related to the value of the Hubble constant measured in direct measurements $H_0$ and the value of the Hubble constant used in parametrization of energy densities $\bar{H}_0$ by $\hat{H}_0=\frac{\bar{H}_0}{H_0}\bar{H}_0$ which may be checked with observations in future after more precise and conclusive measurements of $\hat{H}_0$, $\bar{H}_0$, $H_0$.",
New submissions,Using normal to find abnormal: AI-based anomaly detection in gravitational wave data,"Yi-Yang Guo,Soumya D. Mohanty,Xie Qunying,Yu-Xiao Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The detection and classification of anomalies in gravitational wave data plays a critical role in improving the sensitivity of searches for signals of astrophysical origins. We present ABNORMAL (AI Based Nonstationarity Observer for Resectioning and Marking AnomaLies), a deep neural network (DNN) model for anomaly detection that is trained exclusively on simulated Gaussian noise. By removing dependence on real data for training, the method resolves a circular paradox in anomaly detection: training on real data implicitly involves prior segregation of stationary from non-stationary data but this is not possible unless all anomalies are detected first. ABNORMAL is an autoencoder-based DNN, commonly used in anomaly detection, with the key innovation that it is trained to predict statistical features of noise rather than reconstructing the noise time series themselves. The statistical features are obtained by applying Gabor and Wavelet filter banks, which implement time-frequency analysis, and are subsequently combined through multi-view fusion using a dual-path architecture. We quantify the performance of our method on simulated and real LIGO data. Application to data from the O1 to O3b observational runs uncovers a rich landscape of anomalies over different timescales, including many that do not fit within known classes.",
New submissions,The existence and upper bound for stable photon spheres in static spherically symmetric black holes,"Yong Song,Jiaqi Fu,Yiting Cen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we establish the existence conditions and a universal upper bound on the radius of stable photon spheres (SPS) outside the event horizons of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black holes surrounded by matter fields. We prove that stable photon spheres exist if the external matter satisfies specific conditions. Furthermore, under the additional assumption of a monotonically decreasing mass-radius ratio $m(r)/r^3$ outside the horizon, we derive a strict upper bound on the radius $r_{\mathrm{sps}}$ of any stable photon sphere: $r_{\mathrm{sps}}<6M$, where $M$ is the asymptotic mass of the black hole. This bound is independent of specific black hole solutions and broadly applies to hairy black holes and other configurations with external matter fields meeting the stated energy conditions. Our results resolve fundamental questions regarding the existence and spatial constraints on stable photon orbits, with implications for gravitational lensing, accretion disk dynamics (e.g., the Aschenbach effect), and black hole shadow observations.",
New submissions,Astrometric and polarimetric imprints of hot-spots orbiting parametrized black holes,"João Luís Rosa,Nicolas Aimar,Diego Rubiera-Garcia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We analyze the observational features of hot-spots orbiting parametrized black hole (BH) spacetimes. We select a total of four BH spacetimes, two from the Johanssen-Psaltis (JP) parametrization, and two from the Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) parametrization, corresponding to the most extreme configurations whose shadow sizes are within the $2\sigma$-constraints of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). We use the ray-tracing software GYOTO to simulate the orbit of a spherically symmetric hot-spot emitting synchrotron radiation close to a central parametrized BH object, in a vertical magnetic field configuration, and we extract the corresponding astrometric and polarimetric observables for the Stokes parameters I, Q and U, namely the time integrated fluxes, temporal fluxes and magnitudes, temporal centroid, temporal QU-loops, and temporal Electric Field Position Angle (EVPA). Our results indicate that at low inclination the astrometric observables extracted from the parametrized BH spacetimes considered are qualitatively similar to those extracted from the Schwarzschild one, with minor quantitative deviations caused by differences in the size and position of the secondary images. On the other hand, the polarimetric observables at high inclination present qualitative differences, but these are only visible for a short portion of the whole hot-spot orbit. Furthermore, the observables extracted from the JP parametrized BH models deviate more prominently from those of the Schwarzschild model than the ones extracted from the KZ parametrized BH models, with the JP model with a positive free parameter deviating the most among all models tested. Given the strong similarity among the observables extracted from all models tested, we point out that more precise observations are needed to successfully impose constraints on parametrized BH models via this method.",
New submissions,A Dual One-way Doppler Cancellation Scheme for Enhanced Gravitational Redshift Tests,"Cheng-Gang Qin,Tong Liu,Yang Li,Qi-Long Gong,Qin Li,Zhi-Yu Ma",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Gravitational redshift is an important prediction of General Relativity (GR). We propose a novel dual one-way frequency comparison scheme for gravitational redshift tests in satellite-ground clock experiments. Unlike conventional triple-link Doppler cancellation methods, our approach requires only two optical links, an uplink and a downlink, with Doppler data recorded independently at the satellite and ground station, respectively. Crucially, coherent combination of these measurements suppresses first-order Doppler frequency shift to second order while doubling the gravitational redshift signal. This scheme reduced engineering complexity (50$\%$ fewer links) and amplified redshift sensitivity with a factor of 2 for satellite-ground clock comparison. The scheme's viability hinges on high-precision clock synchronization ($\leq$ 0.1 ns for $10^{-18}$ clock comparison), which is potentially achievable via state-of-the-art time-transfer techniques. Systematic error analysis confirms residual Doppler, atmospheric, and Shapiro shifts remain below $10^{-17}$ for optimized orbits, establishing this scheme as a useful tool for probing fundamental physics beyond GR.",
New submissions,Chaplygin and Polytropic gases Teleparallel Robertson-Walker $F(T)$ gravity solutions,Alexandre Landry,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"This paper investigates the Teleparallel Robertson-Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a Chaplygin gas, and then for any polytropic gas cosmological source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case and the relevant gas equation of state (EoS) to find the new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For flat $k=0$ cosmological case, we find analytical solutions valid for any cosmological scale factor. For curved $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find new approximated teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and very fast universe expansion cases summarizing by a double power-law function. All the new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications on dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy, Anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetimes and several other cosmological processes.",
New submissions,Waiting around for Unruh,"Leo J. A. Parry,Diego Vidal-Cruzprieto,Christopher J. Fewster,Jorma Louko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"How long does a uniformly rotating observer need to interact with a quantum field in order to register an approximately thermal response due to the circular motion Unruh effect? We address this question for a massless scalar field in 2+1 dimensions, defining the effective temperature via the ratio of excitation and de-excitation rates of an Unruh-DeWitt detector in the long interaction time limit. In this system, the effective temperature is known to be significantly smaller than the linear motion Unruh effect prediction when the detector's energy gap is small: the effective temperature tends to zero in the small gap limit, linearly in the gap. We show that a positive small gap temperature at long interaction times can be regained via a controlled long-time-small-gap double limit, provided the detector's coupling to the field is allowed to change sign. The resulting small gap temperature depends on the parameters of the circular motion but not on the details of the detector's switching. The results broaden the energy range for pursuing an experimental verification of the circular motion Unruh effect in analogue spacetime experiments. As a mathematical tool, we provide a new implementation of the long interaction time limit that controls in a precise way the asymptotics of both the switching function and its Fourier transform.",
New submissions,Gravitational quasinormal modes of the Hayward spacetime,"S. V. Bolokhov,Milena Skvortsova",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study gravitational quasinormal modes of the Hayward spacetime, a regular black-hole geometry that also admits an interpretation as an effective quantum-corrected solution within asymptotically safe gravity. Using both the higher-order WKB method supplemented with Pade approximants and time-domain integration with Prony analysis, we obtain accurate spectra for axial perturbations and explore the impact of the quantum parameter $\gamma$. We find that increasing $\gamma$ systematically raises the oscillation frequencies while reducing the damping rates, making the ringdown longer lived. For the first overtone, the effect of $\gamma$ is noticeably stronger than for the fundamental mode, providing an indication of the so-called outburst of overtones previously observed for test fields, and pointing to the particular sensitivity of subdominant modes to near-horizon quantum corrections. In addition, the analytic approximation for quasinormal modes are obtained in the form of expansion beyond the eikonal limit.",
New submissions,Scalar-induced gravitational waves in spatially covariant gravity,"Jiehao Jiang,Jieming Lin,Xian Gao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the framework of spatially covariant gravity (SCG), a broad class of Lorentz-violating modified gravity theories respecting only spatial diffeomorphism invariance. Extending earlier SCG formulations, we compute the general kernel function for SIGWs on a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker background, focusing on polynomial-type SCG Lagrangians up to $d=3$, where $d$ denotes the total number of derivatives in each monomial. We derive explicit expressions for the kernel in the case of power-law time evolution of the coefficients, and restrict attention to the subset of SCG operators whose tensor modes propagate at the speed of light, thereby avoiding late-time divergences in the fractional energy density of SIGWs. Instead of the usual Newtonian gauge, the breaking of time reparametrization symmetry in SCG necessitates a unitary gauge analysis. We compute the energy density of SIGWs for representative parameter combinations, finding distinctive deviations from general relativity (GR), including scale-dependent modifications to both the amplitude and the spectral shape. Our results highlight the potential of stochastic GW background measurements to probe spatially covariant gravity and other Lorentz-violating extensions of GR.",
New submissions,A gravitational spin-orbit interaction in Poincaré gauge theory,"Sebastian Bahamonde,Jorge Gigante Valcarcel",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We show a gravitational spin-orbit interaction that can potentially modify the space-time geometry naturally emerges in the framework of Poincaré gauge theory. For this purpose, we derive the field equations of a particular model with cubic order invariants and demonstrate the existence of analytical solutions which display an interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic angular momentum parameters in the gravitational action, in analogy to the spin-orbit interaction arising from atomic and nuclear systems. Due to the highly nonlinear character of the field equations under stationary and axisymmetric conditions, we focus on a degenerate case which simplifies their complexity, at the cost of constraining the geometry to the Kerr space-time. Thereby, our results indicate more general solutions with a spin-orbit interaction beyond the Kerr space-time are expected to arise in the nondegenerate models of Poincaré gauge theory.",
New submissions,High-frequency continuous gravitational waves searched in LIGO O3 public data with Einstein@Home,"Brian McGloughlin,Benjamin Steltner,Jasper Martins,Maria Alessandra Papa,Heinz-Bernd Eggenstein,Jing Ming,Bernd Machenschalk,Reinhard Prix,Maximilian Bensch",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We search for nearly-monochromatic gravitational wave signals with frequencies $800.0~\textrm{Hz} \leq f \leq 1686.0~\textrm{Hz}$ and spin-down $-2.7\times10^{-9}~\textrm{Hz}\,\textrm{s}^{-1} \leq \dot f \leq 0.2\times 10^{-9}~\textrm{Hz}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$. We use LIGO O3 public data from the Hanford and Livingston detectors and deploy this search on the Einstein@Home volunteer-computing project. This is the most sensitive search carried out to date in this parameter space. Our results are consistent with a non-detection. We set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude $h_{0}$ and translate these to upper limits on neutron star ellipticity and on r-mode amplitude. The most stringent upper limits are at $800~\textrm{Hz}$ with $h_{0} = 1.32\times10^{-25}$, at the $90\%$ confidence level. Searching in the high frequency bands allows us to probe astrophysically interesting ellipticities with our results excluding isolated neutron stars rotating faster than $2.5~\textrm{ms}$ with ellipticities $\epsilon \geq 1.96 \times 10^{-8}\left[\frac{d}{100~\textrm{pc}}\right]$ within a distance $d$ from Earth. Our results also exclude r-mode amplitudes $\alpha \geq 7 \times 10^{-7}\left[\frac{d}{100~\textrm{pc}}\right]$ for neutron stars stars spinning faster than 400 Hz.",
Cross submissions,GammaPBHPlotter: A public code for calculating the complete Hawking evaporation gamma-ray spectra from primordial black holes,"John Carlini,Ilias Cholis",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present GammaPBHPlotter, a public Python code for calculating and plotting the Hawking radiation gamma-ray spectra of primordial black holes in the mass range of $10^{14}$ to $10^{18}$ grams. This tool allows users to compute the monochromatic and mass-averaged spectra of black holes over a range of parameters. We include the primary/direct Hawking emission, the secondary emission from the decay and hadronization of unstable particles, the final state radiation, and the in-flight annihilation gamma-ray emission components.",
Cross submissions,Exploring the astrophysical origins of binary black holes using normalising flows,"Storm Colloms,Christopher P L Berry,John Veitch,Michael Zevin",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The growing number of gravitational-wave detections from binary black holes enables increasingly precise measurements of their population properties. The observed population is most likely drawn from multiple formation channels. Population-synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of each of these channels, and comparing population-synthesis models with the observations allows us to constrain the uncertain physics of binary black hole formation and evolution. However, the most detailed population-synthesis codes are computationally expensive. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate five different population synthesis models, reducing the computational expense, and allowing interpolation between the populations predicted for different simulation inputs. With the trained normalising flows, we measure the branching ratios of different formation channels and details of binary stellar evolution, using the current catalogue of gravitational-wave observations.",
Cross submissions,"Magnetic Field Configurations in Binary Neutron Star Mergers II: Inspiral, Merger and Ejecta","William Cook,Eduardo M. Gutiérrez,Sebastiano Bernuzzi,David Radice,Boris Daszuta,Jacob Fields,Peter Hammond,Harshraj Bandyopadhyay,Maximilian Jacobi",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We perform a series of simulations of magnetised Binary Neutron Star mergers, with varying magnetic field topologies in the initial data, as well as varying Equations of State, and mass ratios. In this paper, a companion paper toarXiv:2506.18995, we analyse the impact of the initial field configuration on the gravitational wave signal, the amplification of the magnetic field, and the ejected material. We investigate the dependence of the phase evolution of the gravitational wave in the post-merger on the initial magnetic field, finding that dephasing between the $(\ell=2,m=2)$ mode of the gravitational wave, and the $(2,1)$ and $(3,3)$ modes may be strongly impacted by the numerical reconstruction scheme. The magnetic field amplification during the Kelvin-Helmholtz dominated phase may be considerably enhanced by anti-aligned fields, or suppressed by toroidal fields. The post-merger amplification of the field due to winding may be suppressed by toroidal fields, and enhanced by asymmetries or mixtures of poloidal and toroidal fields. The field strength in the ejecta may be impacted by the initial magnetic field, with configurations which lead to large amplifications and those with mixtures of poloidal and toroidal fields preferentially emitting highly magnetised material in the polar regions, showing a weaker dependence of the magnetic field on the density of the ejecta than in cases that amplify the magnetic field less. We find that the magnetic field is largely randomly oriented in the ejected material, supporting such models used to estimate thermalisation timescales of ejected material. We find that configurations which begin with an initial bitant symmetry break this symmetry uniformly, independent of the initial configuration, when evolved without an enforced symmetry. This behaviour suggests the presence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking bifurcation in the solution.",
Cross submissions,The index of the cosmological horizon and the area-charge-inequality,Neilha Pinheiro,Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this article, we investigate the index of the MOTS given by a spatial cross section of the cosmological horizon in the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter spacetime. We show that its index is one in the symmetrized sense for a small positive parameter a, such parameter defines the angular momentum. As an application, we prove that this MOTS is unstable. We also establish an estimate relating the area and the charge of a MOTS of index one in a Cauchy data satisfying the dominant energy condition.",

In one-loop calculations, we show that Einstein gravity can be considered as an approximation to gauge theory. We discuss the role of the Chern-Simons wave functions in the quantization.",
Cross submissions,Regular and Floquet bases for gauge and gravity theories: a non perturbative approach,"Davide Fioravanti,Marco Rossi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI),"The main topic of the paper is represented by the change of basis, in Heun-type equations, from the one of decaying (at two singular points) solutions to that of Floquet solutions. Crucial in the connection relations is the phase acquired by the Floquet solutions by going from a (ir)regular singularity to another. The new 'kink method' is exploited to compute the quantum momentum of the Floquet solutions as convergent series, explicitly at all orders. Hence, upon integrating it term by term, the acquired phase can be derived explicitly as a similar series. Since Heun equation and its confluences describe ${\cal N}=2$ SYM theories in the NS background as quantisation of Seiberg-Witten differentials and also appear in perturbations of gravity solutions, tests and predictions in both domains can be made. A very encouraging test is the matching of the acquired phase with the dual gauge period, $A_D$, as given by the Nekrasov instanton function. Actually, the procedure can be considered an alternative to instanton computations. On the gravity side, results for the wave functions are at leading order compatible with analogous expressions found by studying the Teukolsky (or others, like Regge-Wheeler) equation. Besides, the whole construction can represent an useful approach to these equations at all orders, shedding also light on non-perturbative contributions, which should reveal very interesting for the consequences in gravity perturbations.",
Cross submissions,Constraining Ricci-Cubic Holographic Dark Energy from observational data using the MCMC sampling and enhanced Machine learning analysis,"Aritra Sanyal,Prabir Rudra",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we find constraints on the parameter space of the Ricci-Cubic Holographic dark energy (RCHDE) from various observational data sets like Hubble data, cosmic-chronometer data, Baryon-acoustic oscillation data, and also data from gamma-ray bursts. RCHDE is formed from the cubic invariant, which in turn is built from the cubic contractions of the Riemann and Ricci tensors. We have used the Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique to find constraints on the model parameters via Bayesian inference. Contour plots have been obtained for the model parameters, showing their marginalized and joint probability distributions. The best-fit regression lines are found for the constrained model and compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model to verify and validate the model. To complement this data analysis mechanism, we have also performed an enhanced machine learning analysis using observational Hubble parameter data. This approach serves to validate the model's predictive power through independent, data-driven regression techniques. Different graphical illustrations of the machine learning techniques have been presented to understand the results. These illustrations reveal a strong agreement between the Hubble parameter predictions from the machine learning models, the theoretical RCHDE model, and observational data.",

In this work, we search for such a signal in the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Matching our priors to estimates of binary parameters from electromagnetic observations, we find log Bayes factor of 0.22, highlighting that the source can be neither confirmed nor ruled out. We place upper limits at 95% credibility on the chirp mass $M < 6.05 \times 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$, and on the characteristic strain amplitude $\textrm{log}_{10}(h_0)< -14.44$. This partially rules out the parameter space suggested by electromagnetic observations of 3C 66B. We also independently reproduce the calculation of the chirp mass with the 3-mm flux monitor data from the unresolved core of 3C 66B. Based on this, we outline a new methodology for constructing a joint likelihood of electromagnetic and gravitational-wave data from supermassive black hole binaries. Finally, we suggest that firmly established SMBHB candidates may be treated as standard sirens for complementary constraints on the universe expansion rate. With this, we obtain constraints on the Hubble constant with 3C 66B.",
