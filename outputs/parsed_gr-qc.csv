New submissions,3-dimensional charged black holes in $f({Q})$ gravity,"G. G. L. Nashed,Emmanuel N. Saridakis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present new exact charged black hole solutions in (2+1) dimensions within the framework of $f({Q})$ gravity, where ${Q}$ denotes the non-metricity scalar. By considering a cubic $f({Q})$ form we derive classes of charged and uncharged spherically symmetric solutions, and we identify conditions under which these reduce to the well-known Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. Notably, our analysis reveals a novel charged solution that is asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) but cannot be continuously deformed into a GR counterpart, and thus arising purely from thehigher-order nature of the non-metricity corrections. Furthermore, we explore the geometrical properties of the solutions, demonstrating the existence of multiple horizons and a softer central singularity compared to GR. Additionally, we calculate various thermodynamic quantities, such as Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, with results confirming thermal stability. Finally, a detailed study of the geodesic motion and the effective potentials unveils stable photon orbits, as well as the effect of cubic non-metricity corrections on orbital dynamics.",
New submissions,Cylindrical gravitational impulse wave,"Jean Jules Defo,Victor Kamgang Kuetche",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The description of gravitational waves as explosion and implosion waves as predicted by Weber and Wheeler [{\it Rev. Mod. Phys. {\bf 29} 509 (1957)}] in Einstein and Rosen spacetime, has recently been confirmed following observations by the LIGO-VIRGO scientific team [{\it Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 116 } 061102 (2016)}] resulting from the collision of two massive black holes. In this dynamics, we explore a new possibility in the construction of gravitational waves like explosion and implosion waves, the special case of Jordan and Ehlers spacetime, by studying the exact solutions of the Einstein field equations. For this purpose, we use the inverse scattering method of Pomeransky in association with the method of Piran et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. D {\bf 32} 3101 (1985)}] by solving the Einstein field equations in combination with the specific metric derived from Jordan and Ehlers in order to obtain a two-soliton solution with complex conjugate poles that we assimilate to the gravitational wave. Consequently, under certain conditions, we obtain the Einstein and Rosen waves and the Chandrasekhar transcendental waves.",
New submissions,Precision predictions of Starobinsky inflation with self-consistent Weyl-squared corrections,"Eugenio Bianchi,Mauricio Gamonal",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Starobinsky's $R+\alpha R^2$ inflation provides a compelling one-parameter inflationary model that is supported by current cosmological observations. However, at the same order in spacetime derivatives as the $R^2$ term, an effective theory of spacetime geometry must also include the Weyl-squared curvature invariant $W^2$. In this paper, we study the inflationary predictions of the gravitational theory with action of the form $R+\alpha R^2 - \beta W^2$, where the coupling constant $\alpha$ sets the scale of inflation, and corrections due to the $W^2$ term are treated self-consistently via reduction of order in an expansion in the coupling constant $\beta$, at the linear order in $\beta/\alpha$. Cosmological perturbations are found to be described by an effective action with a non-trivial speed of sound $c_{\textrm{s}}$ for scalar and $c_{\textrm{t}}$ for tensor modes, satisfying the relation $c_{\textrm{t}}/c_{\textrm{s}} \simeq 1+ \frac{\beta}{6\, \alpha}$ during the inflationary phase. Within this self-consistent framework, we compute several primordial observables up to the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO). We find the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 3(1-\frac{\beta}{6\alpha})(n_\textrm{s}-1)^2$, the tensor tilt $n_{\textrm{t}}\simeq-\frac{r}{8}$ and the running of the scalar tilt $\mathfrak{a}_{\textrm{s}}\simeq-\frac{1}{2} (n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^2$, all expressed in terms of the observed scalar tilt $n_{\textrm{s}}$. We also provide the corresponding corrections up to N3LO, $\mathcal{O}((n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^3)$.",
New submissions,"Nethotrons: exploring the possibility of measuring relativistic spin precessions, from Earth's satellites to the Galactic Centre",Lorenzo Iorio,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Space Physics (physics.space-ph),"By ``nethotrons'', from the ancient Greek verb for to ``spin'', it is meant here a natural or artificial rotating object, like a pulsar or an artificial satellite, whose rotational axis is cumulatively displaced by the post-Newtonian static (gravitoelectric) and stationary (gravitomagnetic) components of the gravitational field of some massive body around which it freely moves. Until now, both relativistic effects have been measured only by the dedicated space-based mission Gravity Probe B in the terrestrial environment. It detected the gravitoelectric de Sitter and gravitomagnetic Pugh-Schiff spin precessions of four superconducting gyroscopes accumulated in a year after about 50 years from conception to completion of data analysis at a cost of 750 million dollars to $0.3$ and $19$ per cent accuracy, respectively. The perspectives to measure them also with long-lived Earth's laser-ranged geodetic satellites, like those of the LAGEOS family or possibly one or more of them to be built specifically from scratch, and pulsars orbiting the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre, yet to be discovered, are preliminarily investigated. The double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B is examined as well.",
New submissions,Dynamical Horizon Segments and Spacetime Isometries,"Abhay Ashtekar,Badri Krishnan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Given a space-time $(\mathscr{M}, g_{ab})$ admitting a dynamical horizon segment (DHS) $\mathscr{H}$, we show that there are stringent constraints on the Killing fields $\xi^a$ that $g_{ab}$ can admit in a neighborhood of $\mathscr{H}$: Generically, $\xi^a$ can only be a rotational Killing field which, furthermore, leaves each marginally trapped 2-sphere cross-section $\mathcal{S}$ of $\mathscr{H}$ invariant. Finally, if $\xi^a$ happens to be hypersurface orthogonal near $\mathscr{H}$, then, not only the angular momentum but also all spin multipoles vanish on every $\mathcal{S}$; the entire spin structure of these DHSs is indistinguishable from that of spherically symmetric DHSs!",
New submissions,On the Earth's tidal perturbations. II. LARES 2 satellite,"V.G. Gurzadyan,I. Ciufolini,H.G. Khachatryan,S. Mirzoyan,A. Paolozzi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Laser-ranging satellites have proved their efficiency in high precision testing of General Relativity and constraining modified gravity theories proposed to explain the dark sector and the cosmological tensions. The LARES 2 satellite launched in 2022, is currently providing improved information regarding the frame-dragging effect predicted by General Relativity, as well as the geodesy, thus essentially complementing the data of already existing laser-ranging satellites. The proper knowledge of the Earth's tidal perturbation modes is essential for accurately extracting the sought frame-dragging signal. We present the results of computation of 110 significant modes in Doodson number classification for the parameters of LARES 2 satellite, continuing our previous study on those obtained for the LARES satellite.",
New submissions,Analytical solutions of CPT-odd Maxwell equations in Schwarzschild spacetime,"Hao Wang,Zhi Xiao,Bing Sun",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this work, we present the CPT-violating (CPTV) Maxwell equations in curved spacetime using the Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. We obtain a semi-analytical solution to the Maxwell equations in Schwarzschild spacetime under the assumption that the CPT-odd $\left(k_{AF}\right)^\mu$ term exhibits spherical symmetry in the Schwarzschild background. Retaining only terms up to linear order in the $\left(k_{AF}\right)^\mu$ coefficient, we obtain perturbative solutions by treating the solutions of the Lorentz-invariant Maxwell equations as the zeroth-order approximation and incorporating the $\left(k_{AF}\right)^\mu$ terms as an additional source term alongside the external charge current. Each resulting NP scalar field can be factorized into two components: the radial component is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions, while the angular component is described by spin-weighted spherical harmonics.",
New submissions,Variation in the size of the Photon Sphere and Black Hole Shadow in the Modified Gravity,"Kanav Ganguly,Ajay Kumar Sharma,Murli Manohar Verma",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),Black hole shadows are a widespread topic in astrophysics. This paper searches for an optical view of the black hole and the relationship between black hole shadow and photon sphere with curvature. We were inspired by the observations of Sagittarius $A^*$ and supermassive black hole M87$*$ through the Event Horizon Telescope. We have found the signature of the modified theory of gravity on the photon sphere and shadow. We considered $f(R)$ modified theory of gravity and new scalar degree of freedom $F$ appears in the expressions of photon sphere and shadow.,
New submissions,Constraining quadrupole deformations with relativistic effects,"Daniya Utepova,Kuantay Boshkayev,Serzhan Momynov,Anuar Idrissov,Gulzada Baimbetova,Hernando Quevedo,Ainur Urazalina",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate two general relativistic effects - namely, the Shirokov and Shapiro effects - within the framework of the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime ($q$-metric), which generalizes the Schwarzschild solution by incorporating a quadrupole moment. By analyzing the geodesic deviation equations, we explore the oscillatory motion of test particles and demonstrate how the source's quadrupole parameter influences the Shirokov effect. Furthermore, we derive an expression for the Shapiro time delay in this deformed spacetime and examine the quadrupole moment's impact on the gravitational time delay experienced by radio waves propagating near a massive object. The first-order approximation reveals a pronounced effect of the quadrupole parameter on the time delay, in contrast to similar recent analyses. These findings deepen our understanding of how deviations from spherical symmetry influence gravitational phenomena, with potential implications for the study of compact astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and naked singularities or ''black hole mimickers'' that exhibit significant multipolar structures.",
New submissions,On the use and interpretation of signal-model indistinguishability measures for gravitational-wave astronomy,"Jonathan E. Thompson,Charlie Hoy,Edward Fauchon-Jones,Mark Hannam",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The difference (""mismatch"") between two gravitational-wave (GW) signals is often used to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which they will be distinguishable in a measurement or, alternatively, when the errors in a signal model will lead to biased measurements. It is well known that the standard approach to calculate this ""indistinguishability SNR"" is too conservative: a model may fail the criterion at a given SNR, but not necessarily incur a biased measurement of any individual parameters. This problem can be solved by taking into account errors orthogonal to the model space (which therefore do not induce a bias), and calculating indistinguishability SNRs for individual parameters, rather than the full $N$-dimensional parameter space. We illustrate this approach with the simple example of aligned-spin binary-black-hole signals, and calculate accurate estimates of the SNR at which each parameter measurement will be biased. In general biases occur at much higher SNRs than predicted from the standard mismatch calculation. Which parameters are most easily biased depends sensitively on the details of a given waveform model, and the location in parameter space, and in some cases the bias SNR is as high as the conservative estimate. We also illustrate how the parameter bias SNR can be used to robustly specify waveform accuracy requirements for future detectors.",
New submissions,Tensor perturbations in higher derivative gravity theories in $D$ dimensions,Ercan Kilicarslan,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study tensor perturbations of the ghost-free generic non-local gravity theory constructed infinite series of higher derivative terms in $D$ dimensions. The infinite series of higher derivative terms are encoded by form factors, the forms of which can be restricted by requiring that the action remains perturbatively free of ghosts and tachyons around maximally symmetric backgrounds for transverse traceless fluctuations. To demonstrate this, we obtain field equations for AdS plane wave metric in Kerr-Schild form, which yield linearized field equations for transverse-traceless spin-$2$ field. Using unitarity and consistency requirements, we present, as an example, the explicit derivation of non-local form factors in $D$ dimensions.",
New submissions,Enhancing Taiji's Parameter Estimation under Non-Stationarity: a Time-Frequency Domain Framework for Galactic Binaries and Instrumental Noises,"Minghui Du,Ziren Luo,Peng Xu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The data analysis of space-based gravitational wave detectors like Taiji faces significant challenges from non-stationary noise, which compromises the efficacy of traditional frequency-domain analysis. This work proposes a unified framework based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to enhance parameter estimation of Galactic binary and characterization of instrumental noise under non-stationarity. Segmenting data into locally stationary intervals, we derive STFT-based models for signals and noises, and implement Bayesian inference via the extended Whittle likelihood. Validated through the analysis of verification Galactic binaries and instrumental noises, our STFT approach outperforms frequency-domain methods by reducing the uncertainty and bias of estimation, successfully recovering low signal-to-noise ratio signals missed by frequency-domain analysis, and mitigating the degeneracy among noise parameters. The framework's robustness against noise drifts and computational efficiency highlight its potential for integration into future global analysis pipelines.",
New submissions,HBAR entropy of Infalling Atoms into a GUP-corrected Schwarzschild Black Hole and equivalence principle,"Ali Övgün,Reggie C. Pantig",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we have investigated the phenomenon of acceleration radiation exhibited by a two-level atom freely falling into a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP)-corrected Schwarzschild black hole. We derive analytic expressions for the atom's excitation probability with simultaneous emission of a scalar quantum and observe that it satisfies the Einstein equivalence principle when compared to the excitation probability induced by a uniformly accelerating mirror, motivated by studies [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.071301] and [https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1807703115]. We further demonstrate that this equivalence persists for a generic static, spherically symmetric black hole geometry. Adopting an open-quantum-system framework, we then compute the horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy for the GUP-corrected spacetime and find that it reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law, supplemented by universal logarithmic and inverse-area corrections characteristic of GUP effects. These results underline the robustness of thermal radiation processes near horizons and the universality of entropy corrections in quantum-improved black hole spacetimes.",
New submissions,Entanglement and entropy uncertainty in black hole quantum atmosphere,"Shuai Zhang,Li-Juan Li,Xue-Ke Song,Liu Ye,Dong Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In this work, we investigate the properties of Hawking radiation induced by the quantum atmosphere beyond the event horizon, by considering two detectors in Schwarzschild spacetime with the parameterized Hartle-Hawking temperature. \textcolor{black}{We explicitly study the dynamics of quantum entanglement and found that its characteristics are closely correlated with Hawking quantum radiation beyond the event horizon. Namely, its minimal value corresponds to the peak of Hawking radiation.} By virtue of the mutual information, we demonstrate the complementary relationship of the information distribution in the black hole. In addition, we detailedly discuss the influence of distance from the center of black hole to particle, radius of event horizon and Hartle-Hawking constant on the entropy uncertainty in the current scenario, and the results interestingly show that there exists an opposite correlation between the entanglement and the entropy uncertainty. It is believed that our observation could provide a new perspective for understanding the black hole information paradox and black hole thermodynamics.",
New submissions,Detectability of massive binary black holes with sub-mHz gravitational wave missions,"Renjie Wang,Yumeng Xu,Gang Wang,Bin Hu,Rong-Gen Cai",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Beyond LISA, proposed space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions aim to explore the sub-millihertz to microhertz frequency band, with one key objective being the detection of massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers across cosmic distances. In this work, we investigate the detection and localization capabilities of future sub-mHz GW observatories for MBBH coalescences. Including the full galactic foreground noise, we find that signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) can reach several thousand across a wide range of redshifts. We evaluate three representative orbital configurations--non-precessing and precessing with different inclination angles--and analyze their localization performance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a two-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is considered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes. These modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations, thereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz missions operating in the [10 $\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with LISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to their longer interferometric baselines. This results in significantly improved localization of high-mass MBBHs, enhancing the prospects for multi-messenger astronomy and precision cosmology. Moreover, the high SNRs attainable with sub-mHz detectors could enable stringent tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity.",
New submissions,Gauges for quadratic gravity: the extended transverse gauge and the energy-momentum tensor of the massive spin-2 field,"Matheus F. S. Alves,L. G. Medeiros,Davi C. Rodrigues",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the 4D Einstein-Hilbert action extension based on the square of the curvature tensors. Analyses of gauge and perturbation modes are often done considering the Teyssandier gauge condition. Although this approach can be useful for other higher-order extensions of quadratic gravity, a generalized transverse (or Lorentz) gauge is clear and sufficient for the present case, as explained here. We provide a detailed analysis of the generalized transverse gauge condition, its residual gauge symmetry, the physical modes, the induced energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of the massive spin-2 mode (which is gauge-dependent), and a comparison with the Teyssandier gauge. The derivation is valid for any EMT. We also compare the induced EMT in quadratic gravity with the massive spin-2 Fierz-Pauli EMT, which is different from the previous cases. The comparison is further developed by considering a spherical isothermal sphere, which works as an approximation to virialized spherical systems.",
New submissions,Analogous supercritical crossovers in black holes and water,"Shoucheng Wang,Xinyang Li,Yuliang Jin,Li Li",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the supercritical crossovers for black hole thermodynamics in the supercritical regime beyond the critical point, where small and large black holes are indistinguishable from the conventional viewpoint. We establish a refined supercritical phase diagram that comprehensively characterizes small, large, and indistinguishable black hole phases, whose boundaries are defined by two supercritical crossover lines. The universal scaling laws of the two crossover lines are fully verified using black hole thermodynamics in both the standard consideration and the extended thermodynamic phase space by treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. Remarkable analogies are observed when the supercritical phase diagrams of the two frameworks of black holes are compared to those corresponding to liquid-gas and liquid-liquid phase transitions. The present study can be extended to a variety of more complicated black hole backgrounds and provide valuable insights into the fundamental nature of black hole thermodynamics.",
New submissions,Quasi-normal modes and echoes of generalized black hole bounces and their correspondence with shadows,"Albert Duran-Cabacés,Diego Rubiera-Garcia,Diego Sáez-Chillón Gómez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a family of generalized black bounces interpolating between regular black holes and traversable wormhole solutions according to a single extra parameter $a$. Firstly, working with a generic spherically symmetric space-time with arbitrary radial function and an anisotropic fluid matter source, the general equations for the gravitational waves are obtained. Then, we focus on such particular space-time metric and use the time-domain method to find the evolution of the QNMs with respect to the parameter $a$, finding larger frequencies and damped modes as $a$ grows. Furthermore we find that, for a gap in the values of $a$ for which no horizon is present but several photon spheres are, echoes are produced. Such echoes, which come from trapped modes in the potential well that are eventually leaked off for higher frequencies, appear as repetitions of the original wave but with modulated amplitude and decreased frequencies, and study their evolution with $a$. In addition, at the light of the correspondence recently discussed in the literature between QNMs and black hole imaging, we discuss the relation of the features of such echoes with those features (photon rings and shadows) of optical images from thin accretion disks. Despite working with simplified models and settings, our analysis provides useful insights on the usefulness of the correspondence for both gravitational waves and shadows.",
New submissions,"Quantum gravitational corrections at third-order curvature, acoustic analog black holes and their quasinormal modes","R. Casadio,C. Noberto Souza,R. da Rocha",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Quasinormal modes for bosonic (scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational) and fermionic field perturbations, radiated from black holes that carry quantum gravitational corrections at third order in the curvature to the Schwarzschild solution, are scrutinized from the propagation of analog transonic sound waves across a de Laval nozzle. The thermodynamic variables, the nozzle geometry, the Mach number, and the thrust coefficient are computed as functions of the parameter driving the effective action for quantum gravity containing a dimension-six local operator beyond general relativity. The quasinormal modes for quantum gravitational corrected analog black holes are also determined for higher overtones, yielding a more precise description of the quantum-corrected ringdown process and the gravitational waveform way before the fundamental mode sets in.",
Cross submissions,Spin-orbit misalignment and residual eccentricity are evidence that neutron star-black hole mergers form through triple star evolution,"Jakob Stegmann,Jakub Klencki",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"There is growing evidence that a substantial fraction of the neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) detected through gravitational waves merge with non-zero eccentricity or large BH spin-orbit misalignment. This is in tension with the leading formation scenarios to date. Residual eccentricity rules out formation through isolated binary star evolution, while NS natal kicks and the unequal masses of NSBHs inhibit efficient pairing in dense stellar environments. Here, we report that all observed properties-NSBH merger rate, eccentricity, and spin-orbit misalignment-are explained by the high prevalence of massive stellar triples in the field. Modelling their evolution from the ZAMS, we investigate NSBH mergers caused by gravitational perturbations from a tertiary companion. We show that the formation of the NS decisively impacts the triple stability, preferentially leaving behind surviving NSBHs in compact triple architectures. The rich three-body dynamics of compact, unequal-mass triples enables mergers across a wide range of orbital parameters without requiring fine-tuned highly inclined tertiary orbits and provides a natural explanation for an abundance of residual eccentricity and spin-orbit misalignment. We infer a total NSBH merger rate of $R\sim1-23\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, with more than a few 10% exhibiting eccentricity $e_{20}>0.1$ or large spin-orbit misalignment $\cos\theta_{\rm BH}<0$, consistent with current observations. Tertiary-driven NSBH mergers closely track the cosmic star formation rate due to their short delay times, include a substantial fraction of burst-like highly eccentric systems ($e_{20} > 0.9$), and almost universally retain eccentricities $e_{20}>10^{-3}$, potentially detectable by next-generation detectors. If evidence for eccentric and misaligned events solidifies, our results suggest that triple dynamics is the dominant formation channel of NSBH mergers.",
Cross submissions,Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral,"Sami Kaya,Pratik Rath,Kyle Ritchie",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the ""hollowed"" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the Rényi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.",
Cross submissions,Locating the QCD critical point with neutron-star observations,"Christian Ecker,Niko Jokela,Matti Järvinen",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"We present a probabilistic model for the QCD critical endpoint (CEP) and the equation of state (EOS) at $\beta$-equilibrium, constrained by neutron-star observations. Using a hybrid framework that combines the holographic V-QCD model with an effective van der Waals description of nuclear matter, we generate a large ensemble of EOSs incorporating nuclear theory uncertainties. Constraining this ensemble with neutron-star mass-radius data and tidal deformability measurements from gravitational waves, we identify a strong first-order deconfinement transition at zero temperature, with a transition strength of $\Delta n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 3.75^{+0.70}_{-0.53}$ and onset density $n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 4.9^{+1.33}_{-1.17}$. The resulting posterior yields $95\%$ credible intervals for the CEP location: $\mu_{\rm{crit}} = 626^{+90}_{-179}\,\rm{MeV}$, $T_{\rm{crit}} = 119^{+14}_{-6}\,\rm{MeV}$.",
Cross submissions,EFT Corrections to Charged Black Hole Quasinormal Modes,"William L. Boyce,Jorge E. Santos",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the impact of higher-derivative corrections from Effective Field Theory on the quasinormal mode spectrum of Reissner-Nordström black holes. While previous work has explored corrections to Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes - typically using small-rotation approximations - a comprehensive analysis near extremality remains lacking. We focus on Reissner-Nordström black holes as a tractable model admitting an extremal limit, enabling investigation of the effect of these corrections on the so-called zero damped modes, which dominate in this regime. Specifically, we derive a corrected Moncrief equation governing quasinormal modes and present both analytic and numerical results for the corrected frequencies. This work also offers the first explicit test of the recently proposed ""Quasinormal Mode Causality"" boundarXiv:2401.05524, which constrains Effective Field Theory coefficients by requiring that quasinormal mode lifetimes do not increase measurably under ultraviolet-complete Effective Field Theory corrections. Using Standard Model contributions - particularly those arising from integrating out the electron - we verify that this bound holds. Our results provide new insights into the interplay between Effective Field Theory, extremal black hole dynamics, and causality in gravitational theories.",
Cross submissions,Positron Signal from the Early Universe,"L. Stodolsky,J. Silk",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Bursts from the very early universe may lead to a detectable signal via the production of positrons, whose annihilation gives an observable X-ray signal. Using the absorption parameters for the annihilation photons of 511 keV, it is found that observable photons would originate at a red-shift around $z\approx$ 200-300, resulting in soft X-rays of energy $\sim$ 2-3 keV at present. Positrons are expected to be absent at these times or red-shifts in the standard picture of the early universe. Detection of the X-rays would thus provide dramatic support for the hypothesis of the bursts, explosive events at very early times. We urge the search for such a signal.",
Cross submissions,Spacetime quantum mechanics for bosonic and fermionic systems,"N. L. Diaz,R. Rossignoli",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics (QM) where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral (PI) formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action enabled by the novel notion of timelike correlations.",
Cross submissions,Complexity equals anything for multi-horizon black holes,"Hong-Yue Jiang,Yu-Xiao Liu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the ``complexity equals anything"" proposal with codimension-one and codimension-zero gravitational observables for multi-horizon black holes, using the Bardeen-AdS class black hole as an example. In particular, we compare the results with the ``complexity equals volume"" (CV) proposal and find that the ``complexity equals anything"" ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{gen}}$) enables the probing of a more complete black hole interior, that is, all spacetime regions where the blackening factor $f(r)<0$. This is the advantage brought by the flexibility of this holographic complexity conjecture. In addition, we compute the complexity derived from various geometric quantities and show that these constructions can effectively differentiate the distinct interior regions of the black hole.",
Cross submissions,Rotating Carroll Black Holes: A No Go Theorem,"Ivan Kolář,David Kubiznak,Poula Tadros",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recently, there has been a lot of interest in Carroll black holes and in particular whether or not one could find a Carrollian analogue of a rotating black hole spacetime. Here we show that every stationary and axisymmetric solution (and thence also a black hole) of Carrollian general relativity in any number of $d\geq 3$ dimensions is necessarily also static. Using this result, we construct a unique stationary and axisymmetric black hole in three dimensions - a static Carroll BTZ black hole. At the same time, we find a Carrollian analogue of an accelerating black hole, showing that Schwarzschild is not the only possible stationary and axisymmetric Carroll black hole in four dimensions. A generalization of the no go theorem to include Maxwell, dilatonic, and axionic matter fields is also discussed.",
Cross submissions,Constraining the lensing dispersion from the angular clustering of binary black hole mergers,"Fumihiro Chuman,Masamune Oguri",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries provide direct measurements of luminosity distances and serve as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe. In addition to their role as standard sirens, they offer an opportunity to constrain small-scale density fluctuations through the dispersion in the distance-redshift relation induced by gravitational lensing. We propose a method to constrain this lensing dispersion without requiring the redshift information by analyzing the angular clustering of gravitational wave sources. Our formalism incorporating second-order lensing effects in the luminosity distance shows that the amplitude of the auto-correlation angular clustering decreases with increasing lensing dispersion. While we show that the auto-correlation signal is detected with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios in future gravitational wave experiments, there exists a strong degeneracy between the lensing dispersion and the linear bias of gravitational wave sources. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is partially broken by a joint analysis of the auto-correlation of gravitational wave sources and the cross-correlation with galaxies whose redshifts are known. This approach enhances the use of gravitational waves as a cosmological probe at high redshifts.",
Cross submissions,$α$-attractor inflation modified by GUP in light of ACT observations,"Hana Heidarian,Milad Solbi,Soma Heydari,Kayoomars Karami",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Here, the $\alpha$-attractor inflation is investigated within a framework incorporating a minimal measurable length, as implemented by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model observational viability against recent high-precision data, primarily from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6) combined with Planck, DESI BAO, and BICEP/Keck 2018 observations (P-ACT-LB-BK18). Our results indicate that while the standard $\alpha$-attractor model ($\beta=0$) for $N_*=60$ lies near the $2\sigma$ boundary of the P-ACT-LB-BK18 dataset, the inclusion of GUP effects significantly shifts the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Notably, for the GUP parameter $\beta$ values surpassing approximately $10^{13}$, the model predictions are shown to fall well within the 68\% CL region of this combined observational data, enhancing its consistency. The viable parameter space in the $\alpha-\beta$ plane is explored, revealing that a maximum $\alpha \simeq 0.74$ is consistent with the 68\% CL for $\beta \simeq 1.4\times 10^{13}$. In addition, for smaller values of $\alpha$, the predictions of the model remain inside the 68\% CL region for larger values of $\beta$.",
Cross submissions,On the calculation of p-values for quadratic statistics in Pulsar Timing Arrays,Rutger van Haasteren,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) projects have reported various lines of evidence suggesting the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background in their data. One key line of evidence involves a detection statistic sensitive to inter-pulsar correlations, such as those induced by GWs. A $p$-value is then calculated to assess how unlikely it is for the observed signal to arise under the null hypothesis $H_0$, purely by chance. However, PTAs cannot empirically draw samples from $H_0$. As a workaround, various techniques are used in the literature to approximate $p$-values under $H_0$. One such technique, which has been heralded as a model-independent method, is the use of ``scrambling'' transformations that modify the data to cancel out pulsar correlations, thereby simulating realizations from $H_0$. In this work, scrambling methods and the detection statistic are investigated from first principles. The $p$-value methodology that is discussed is general, but the discussions regarding a specific detection statistic apply to the detection of a stochastic background of gravitational waves with PTAs. All methods in the literature to calculate $p$-values for such a detection statistic are rigorously analyzed, and many analytical expressions are derived. All this leads to the conclusion that scrambling methods are \emph{not} model-independent and thus not completely empirical. Rigorous Bayesian and Frequentist $p$-value calculation methods are advocated, the evaluation of which depend on the generalized $\chi^2$ distribution. This view is consistent with the posterior predictive $p$-value approach that is already in the literature. Efficient expressions are derived to evaluate the generalized $\chi^2$ distribution of the detection statistic on real data. It is highlighted that no Frequentist $p$-values have been calculated correctly in the PTA literature to date.",

Alongside this result, we introduce and study a natural concept of isomorphy of normalized bounded Lorentzian metric measure spaces. We outline applications to the spacetime reconstruction problem from causal set theory. Lastly, we propose three notions of convergence of (isomorphism classes of) normalized bounded Lorentzian metric measure spaces, for which we prove several fundamental properties.",
