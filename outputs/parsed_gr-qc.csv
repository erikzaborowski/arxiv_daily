New submissions,Superradiance and Quasinormal Modes of Massive Scalar Fields around Kerr Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion Theory with Perfect Fluid Dark Matter,Teparksorn Pengpan,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the dynamics of massive scalar fields around Kerr black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theory, incorporating the effects of perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), characterized by the dilaton parameter $r_2$ and the PFDM parameter $\lambda$. These parameters modify both the ergosphere and the effective potential experienced by the scalar field. Using the asymptotic matching method, we compute superradiant amplification factors, while quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies are obtained via the asymptotic iteration method (AIM). Our results reveal contrasting effects: increasing $r_2$ enhances superradiance and leads to higher QNM frequencies with greater damping, whereas increasing $\lambda$ suppresses superradiance and reduces QNM frequencies with weaker damping. In combined scenarios, the influence of $\lambda$ is found to be dominant. These findings extend the understanding of Kerr black holes in EMDA backgrounds and highlight the stabilizing role of PFDM in such systems.",
New submissions,ER = EPR in Loop Quantum Gravity: the Immirzi Parameter and the Continuum Limit,Fabrizio Tamburini,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We recast the finite-region analysis of Einstein's equations that underpins the ER=EPR program into the loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework. By translating curvature-energy uncertainty relations into holonomy-flux kinematics, and by identifying Planckian Einstein-Rosen throats with single-puncture cuts through spin networks, we obtain a precise dictionary between entanglement and quantum geometry. Within this dictionary we derive the Barbero-Immirzi parameter directly from the entanglement/area increment of a minimal bridge, and show that a boundary edge-mode construction renders the Bekenstein - Hawking entropy coefficient universal and independent of $\gamma$ under a natural complex polarization. We further establish a refinement renormalization flow for spin-foam amplitudes driven by the finite-region curvature energy bound, which suppresses bubble divergences and yields a regulator-independent continuum limit under explicit conditions. Finally, we indicate observational consequences that follow from an $N$-party generalized uncertainty relation.",
New submissions,Scalar fields from nonlinear sigma models on black hole spacetimes,"Ludovico Machet,Llibert Aresté Saló",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Scalar fields with non-trivial kinetic term derived from a nonlinear sigma model are motivated by UV completions of gravity such as string theory. We discuss the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{O}(3)$ sigma models with interacting potentials and simulate their full nonlinear dynamics on black hole spacetimes. We study the properties of the field as a function of the curvature of the sigma model with respect to the free massive scalar case. In the accretion process, the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ model behaves as a self-interacting field with attractive interaction, while the $\mathrm{O}(3)$ one exhibits a repulsive phenomenology. In the case of a binary black hole system, these models cause a positive or negative dephasing of the gravitational waveform, respectively, when compared to the non-interacting case and as long as the field's Compton wavelength is larger than the binary separation. We observe no bosenova emission, which suggests that nonlinearities tend to suppress this phenomenon. Our results highlight how the kinetic and potential terms are both relevant in determining the field dynamics.",
New submissions,Fundamental Noise and Gravitational-Wave Sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA),"Teviet Creighton(1),Philippe Lognonné(2),Mark P. Panning(3),James Trippe(4),Volker Quetschke(1),Karan Jani(4) ((1) South Texas Space Science Institute, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, (2) Université Paris Cité, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, (3) Jet Propulsion Laboratory, (4) Vanderbilt Lunar Labs Initiative, Vanderbilt University)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The Earth's Moon presents a uniquely advantageous environment for detecting astrophysical gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range of millihertz to decihertz. Unlike Terrestrial GW detectors, the quiet seismic environment of the Moon does not impede detection in this band; in fact the ground motions of the Moon will be excited by GWs, making the Moon a resonant amplifier at low frequencies. The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) mission aims to be limited by thermal Brownian noise in its optics across most target frequencies. By taking advantage of the lunar normal mode resonances, we show that the first phase of the mission, LILA Pioneer, achieves the GW sensitivity required to study astrophysical sources through the millihertz to decihertz range. The advanced phase of the mission, LILA Horizon, would increase GW sensitivity to the cosmological horizon in this band.",
New submissions,Imprints of screened dark energy on non-local quantum correlations,"Fabiano Feleppa,Gaetano Lambiase,Sunny Vagnozzi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.",
New submissions,Friedmann cosmology with hyperfluids of constant equation of state,"Ilaria Andrei,Damianos Iosifidis,Laur Järv,Margus Saal",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We discuss some aspects of cosmology in metric-affine theories of gravity where metric and affine connection are independent variables. Such constructions, apart from the usual energy-momentum tensor, have an additional source, that of hypermomentum. Working with the cosmological principle assumption, we investigate the dynamics of the hypermomentum's degrees of freedom. In particular, we focus on the case where these degrees of freedom are proportional to the matter density and discuss the cosmological evolution depending on their associated indexes.",
New submissions,Extended black hole thermodynamics in a DGP braneworld,Naman Kumar,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Extended black hole thermodynamics, or ``black hole chemistry,'' is usually formulated in asymptotically AdS spacetimes by promoting the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to a thermodynamic variable and identifying $P=-\Lambda/8\pi$ as the pressure. This approach, however, is less physically motivated: $\Lambda$ is a fixed coupling of the bulk action. Moreover, in de Sitter space, the construction is even more problematic due to the absence of a global timelike Killing vector and the presence of multiple horizons. In this work, we show that extended thermodynamics arises naturally in a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld once the brane tension $\sigma$ is varied in the Iyer--Wald formalism. A positive-tension brane is dynamically stable, ghost-free, and induces a localized vacuum energy density $T^{(\sigma)}_{\mu\nu}=-\sigma g_{\mu\nu}$, corresponding to a negative pressure $P_\sigma=-\sigma$. On the normal branch, the brane is asymptotically flat with a well-defined ADM mass and a single black hole horizon, thereby avoiding the obstructions that arise in de Sitter. We demonstrate that varying $\sigma$ produces a new work term $V_\sigma\,\delta P_\sigma$ in the first law, with $V_\sigma$ reducing exactly to the geometric volume $4\pi r_h^3/3$ for a static spherical black hole. The associated Smarr relation is derived, and we show how asymptotic flatness can be maintained along the family of solutions by co-varying the bulk cosmological constant. Our results establish that extended black hole thermodynamics is not restricted to AdS spacetimes but also arises consistently in asymptotically flat braneworlds through brane tension, providing a new setting for black hole chemistry.",
New submissions,Lightweight posterior construction for gravitational-wave catalogs with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network,"Wenshuai Liu,Yiming Dong,Ziming Wang,Lijing Shao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Applications (stat.AP); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.",
New submissions,Common Envelope Evolution of Ultralight Boson Clouds,"Ao Guo,Qi-Yan Zhang,Huan Yang,Jun Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Ultralight bosons can be excited around spinning black holes via black hole superradiance. These boson clouds may play an important role in the orbital evolution of binary black holes. In this work, we investigate the formation and evolution of common envelopes of ultralight boson clouds in comparable mass-ratio black hole binaries. We describe the cloud evolution using gravitational molecular eigenstates and analyze the possible level transitions during orbital decay, as well as the impact on orbital dynamics. We find that the cloud can generally lead to eccentricity growth. In particular, the eccentricity may vary significantly during level transition, leaving an eccentricity of ${\cal O}(0.1)$ within the detection band of ground-based gravitational wave detectors.",
New submissions,"The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause",Lorenzo Iorio,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph),"The eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole M87* and our solar system may all have in common the presence of a massive pointlike distant companion perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. To this aim, the long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of the relative motion of a gravitationally bound two-body system acted upon by a massive remote perturber are analytically worked out in full generality and presented in a way facilitating a straightforward application to those and other potentially interesting astronomical scenarios. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.",
New submissions,The Barrow entropies in the thermodynamics of high-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black holes,"Yuxuan Shi,Hongbo Cheng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the thermodynamics of $D$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black holes with Barrow entropy. It is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the Barrow factor revise the thermodynamic variables such as event horizon, Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity. It is interesting that the larger five-dimensional black holes exist stably and the smaller ones evaporate to disappear owing to the nature of heat capacities amended by the coupling and factor. The discussions exhibit that the $D$-dimensional black holes with $D=6, 7$ set free all of their energy to vanish because of the minus heat capacities as functions of Hawking temperature although the extra term and the fractal power bring about their revisions on the functions, but they cannot change the heat capacity signs, so they also cannot change the fate of six- or seven-dimensional black holes.",
New submissions,Modified first law of charged dilaton black hole,"Pabitra Tripathy,Amit Ghosh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the thermodynamics of a charged dilaton black hole arising from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, where the dilaton couples exponentially to the Maxwell field via a dimensionless parameter a. Treating a as a continuous solution parameter, we extend the black hole first law to include a term Psi^A da, where Psi^A is the thermodynamic potential conjugate to a. We derive Psi^A explicitly through a differential analysis of the mass, charge, and entropy, and confirm its form via an independent Hamiltonian calculation. Additionally, by promoting a to a spacetime-dependent scalar and introducing auxiliary gauge fields, we provide a geometric interpretation of Psi^A as a conserved Noether charge. We further analyze the implications of treating a as a thermodynamic variable within the extended phase space. Despite the modification to the first law, we demonstrate that the Smarr relation remains unaffected due to the dimensionless nature of a, highlighting the distinction between variational and scaling symmetries. Our analysis supports the thermodynamic relevance of coupling constants and enriches the framework of extended black hole thermodynamics.",
New submissions,On energy bounds in asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes,Virinchi Rallabhandi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"This work considers positive energy theorems in asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes. Particular attention is given to spacetimes where conformal infinity has compact, Einstein cross-sections admitting Killing or parallel spinors; a positive energy theorem is derived for such spacetimes in terms of geometric data intrinsic to the cross-section. This is followed by the first complete proofs of the BPS inequalities in (the bosonic sectors of) 4D and 5D minimal, gauged supergravity, including with magnetic fields. The BPS inequalities are proven for asymptotically AdS spacetimes, but also generalised to the aforementioned class of asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes.",
New submissions,Gravitational perturbations of the Hayward spacetime and testing the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors,Zainab Malik,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The paper studies axial gravitational perturbations of the Hayward black hole, a regular geometry that also arises as an effective solution in asymptotically safe gravity. By computing grey-body factors with the 6th-order WKB method and comparing them to predictions based on the quasinormal modes, the correspondence between transmission coefficients and quasinormal spectra is verified. Quantum corrections, parametrized by $\gamma$, are shown to suppress both the grey-body factors and the absorption cross-section, while the correspondence remains accurate at the percent level for low multipoles and essentially exact for higher ones.",
New submissions,Long-lived quasinormal modes and echoes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Proca theory,B. C. Lütfüoğlu,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study quasinormal modes and time-domain profiles of a massive scalar field in the background of black holes arising in Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet--Proca gravity. The black holes in this theory possess \emph{primary Proca hair}, which modifies the effective potential and gives rise to distinctive dynamical phenomena. Using three complementary numerical techniques -- the WKB method with Padé resummation, time-domain integration, and the Frobenius (Leaver) method -- we obtain accurate spectra of quasinormal frequencies. Our analysis shows that increasing the scalar-field mass leads to arbitrarily long-lived states, known as quasi-resonances, a behavior shared by both the fundamental mode and the first overtone. The real part of the quasinormal mode decreases for the first and higher overtones and starting from the second overtone it reaches zero at some critical value of mass of the field. When the effective potential develops an additional peak, the late-time signal exhibits a sequence of echoes. Furthermore, the time-domain evolution reveals distinct regimes of intermediate power-law tails $\sim t^{-4/3-\ell}\sin(A(\mu)t)$ and a universal asymptotic tails $\sim t^{-5/6}\sin(\mu t)$.",
New submissions,String Corrected Scalar Field Inflation Compatible with the ACT Data,V.K. Oikonomou,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider the impact of the first string corrections of minimally coupled single scalar field theory on inflationary dynamics. Specifically we consider separately the string corrections $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi)c_2\,\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ and $\sim \alpha'c \square \phi \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$, where $\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale. Our aim is to develop a theory which is self consistent in the sense that the field equations reproduce themselves in the slow-roll approximation. Such a requirement for the theory with $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi) c_2\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ resulted to a trivial non-minimal coupling function $\xi(\phi)$, however a self-consistent framework emerged from the theory with correction term $\sim \alpha' c \square \phi \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$. The resulting theory can easily be worked out analytically and we obtained an inflationary theory that can easily be fitted with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope constraints on the scalar spectral index and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio.",
New submissions,On the Dynamics of Extended Bodies and the GravoThermo Memory Effect,"Raihaneh Moti,Ali Shojai",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The non-linearity of the theory of gravity induces a hysteresis effect in both the systems interacting with gravity and in the gravitational field. The effect is usually referred to as the memory effect. In this paper, we explore this phenomenon in the context of the dynamics of extended rotating objects in the presence of a gravitational wave pulse. Then, we consider an ensemble of such objects and show that a redistribution of spin orientations takes place as a gravitational wave passes through. We examine how this redistribution, changes the partition function and the thermodynamic quantities including entropy and energy of the system. The result shows that some information about the source of the gravitation wave is encoded in the thermodynamics of the system.",
Cross submissions,Causality Detection via Symplectic Quandles,Amirbek Baxshilloyev,Geometric Topology (math.GT); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study whether symplectic quandle colorings can reveal causal structure encoded by ""sky links"" - i.e. links consisting of spheres of all light rays through two points in the space of all light rays of a spacetime. Building on the known limitations of the Alexander-Conway polynomial, we compare the connected sum of two Hopf links (which represents all causally unrelated situations) with the first two Allen-Swenberg links (that are the only known examples when this polynomial does not work). For each diagram we report both the quandle counting invariant (total number of colorings) and an enhanced version that records how many distinct colors appear in each coloring. In our tests over small finite fields, plain counts often agree across examples, but the enhanced invariant consistently separates the Hopf case from the Allen-Swenberg family, and becomes more discriminating as the field grows. A simple transfer step suggests that this effect persists along the whole sequence. These results point to enhanced symplectic quandle colorings as a practical, computable indication of causality that classical polynomials alone may miss; the first examples of this kind were discovered by Jain.",
Cross submissions,Topology of the Superconducting Heart of Neutron Stars: Effects of Microphysics and Gravitational-Wave Signatures,"Mayusree Das(IISc),Armen Sedrakian(UWr, FIAS),Banibrata Mukhopadhyay(IISc)",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a general-relativistic study of the distribution of proton superconductivity in strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), employing the $XNS$ code to solve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. This work extends the previous investigation by us in a few key directions: (i) we explore equilibrium configurations with both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field geometries, (ii) we account for complex many-body effects incorporating microscopically derived pairing gaps, and (iii) our models utilize equation(s) of state (EoS) derived from microscopic many-body theory, including realistic two- and three-body nuclear forces, as well as from relativistic mean-field models. We compare superconducting topologies across our collection of EoS and explore the influences of magnetic field geometry in stellar models parameterized by central density. Our models confirm the absence of $S$-wave superconductivity in the inner core and, importantly, reveal that non-superconducting regions exhibit complex three-dimensional geometries: doughnut-shaped for toroidal fields and prolate-shaped for poloidal fields -- spatial structures that are inherently absent from one-dimensional analyses. We also compute magnetic deformations and ellipticities for several millisecond pulsars (MSPs), estimating their continuous gravitational wave (CGW) strain. While these MSPs remain undetectable by current detectors, next-generation instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer may detect their signals, opening an observational window into internal superconductivity and internal magnetic field of NSs, as well as, the fundamental microphysics of dense matter.",
Cross submissions,Time-Symmetric Action-at-a-Distance Electrodynamics and the Principle of Action and Reaction for Particles at Relative Rest,Calin Galeriu,Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a theory of time-symmetric action-at-a-distance electrodynamic or gravitational interactions where the four-forces depend only on the electric charges, the rest masses, the position four-vectors, and the four-velocities of the two interacting particles, but not on their four-accelerations or higher derivatives. The goal is to prove that the principle of action and reaction is obeyed due to the fact that, for a given pair of corresponding infinitesimal segments along the worldlines of the two particles, the impulse of the advanced four-force and the impulse of the retarded four-force are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For two particles at relative rest, we derive this result as the outcome of a symmetry operation in flat conformal space. We start by assuming a positive spacetime interval between the two interacting particles, and we perform a conformal inversion (an improper inversion in a hypersphere), after which the two particles exchange their position and time coordinates and their rest masses. Then we perform an improper reflection across the axis connecting the two particles, after which the two particles recover their initial four-velocities, up to a minus sign. Two improper coordinate transformations are needed together in order to obtain a resulting positive Jacobian determinant. In the final step we go to the limit of a null spacetime interval between the endpoints of the corresponding infinitesimal segments. When the two interacting particles are at rest, or move with the same velocity, the initial and the final physical parameters that determine the four-forces are identical. Due to symmetry, the principle of action and reaction emerges. We make the conjecture that another, undetermined yet, symmetry operation must also apply, in order for the principle of action and reaction to hold even for particles moving with different velocities.",
Cross submissions,Varying fundamental constants cosmography,C. J. A. P. Martins,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Cosmography is a model-independent phenomenological approach to observational cosmology, relying on Taylor series expansions of physical quantities as a function of the cosmological redshift or other analogous variables. A recent work developed the formalism for a cosmographic analysis of astrophysical and local measurements of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and provided first constraints on the corresponding parameters. Here we update the earlier work, both by including more recent measurements of $\alpha$, and by extending it to other fundamental dimensionless couplings. We find no statistically significant evidence for such variations, and place stringent constraints on the first two terms of all these cosmographic series: the linear coefficient in the $\alpha$ series is constrained to parts per billion level, thanks to recently improved atomic clock constraints, while the other coefficients are constrained to parts per million level. Additionally, we use the same data to place cosmographic constraints on models from a broad class of Grand Unified Theories in which varying fundamental constants occur, and highlight how future data can provide a discriminating cosmographic test between freezing and thawing dark energy models.",
Cross submissions,Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage,"Jinghao Zhang,Yacheng Kang,Jiahang Zhong,Hong-Bo Li,Liang-Duan Liu,Yun-Wei Yu,Lijing Shao",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.",
Cross submissions,Lensing amplitude anomaly and varying electron mass alleviate the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions,"Yi-Ying Wang,Lei Lei,Shao-Peng Tang,Yi-Zhong Fan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmological measurements have revealed tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, notably discrepancies in the Hubble constant and $S_8$ parameter. Additionally, recent observations suggested evidence of a possible non-flat spatial curvature and an anomalous CMB lensing amplitude that beyond the $\Lambda$CDM framework. In this study, we explore whether introducing a variation in the electron mass $m_e$, allowing non-zero spatial curvature $\Omega_K$, and a free lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ can resolve these persistent tensions. Without relying on any local Universe measurements, we obtain $H_0 = 69.61^{+0.60}_{-0.55} \rm \, km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$ and $S_8= 0.808\pm0.012$, with $\Delta m_e / m_e = 0.0109^{+0.0066}_{-0.0062}$ and $A_{\rm lens} = 1.030^{+0.039}_{-0.037}$, both of which exceed the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We find no indication of spatial curvature deviating from flatness, even when including the Cosmic Chronometers and SNe Ia samples. Our results point to a promising direction for cosmological models to reconcile these discrepancies, although more precise data from future experiments will be necessary to clarify these modifications.",
Cross submissions,Tracing Signatures of Modified Gravity in Redshift-Space Galaxy Bispectrum Multipoles: Prospects for Euclid,"Sourav Pal,Debanjan Sarkar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the galaxy bispectrum multipoles in the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, where a scalar degree of freedom mediates a fifth force that is screened in high-density environments. The model is specified by $f_{R0}$, the present-day background value of the scalar field, which controls the strength of deviations from General Relativity (GR). Using perturbation theory, we compute the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum with the full scale- and time-dependent second-order kernels, incorporating corrections from the scale-dependent growth rate and nonlinear screening. Expanding the bispectrum in spherical harmonics, we analyze the sensitivity of the multipoles to modified gravity and forecast their detectability in a \textit{Euclid}-like survey. The monopole ($B_0^0$) and quadrupole ($B_2^0$) show the strongest signatures, with relative deviations of $2\%$-$8\%$ at $z=0.7$ and $k_1\simeq0.3\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for $f_{R0}=10^{-5}$. Higher multipoles provide weaker but complementary signals. Finger-of-God damping and galaxy bias significantly modulate the results, requiring joint modeling of these nuisance parameters. For \textit{Euclid}, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios up to $\sim30$ for the monopole and $\sim15$ for the quadrupole. These results demonstrate that bispectrum multipoles are a powerful probe of gravity, capable of breaking degeneracies with bias and velocity effects and strengthening constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.",
Cross submissions,Dark Energy Is Not That Into You: Variable Couplings after DESI DR2 BAO,"Weiqiang Yang,Sibo Zhang,Olga Mena,Supriya Pan,Eleonora Di Valentino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) scenarios, the interaction function typically includes a coupling parameter $\xi$ that quantifies the strength of energy exchange between the dark sectors. While $\xi$ is often assumed to be constant, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a time-dependent coupling, which could provide a more general and realistic description of dark sector dynamics. In this work, we study two widely used interacting models involving pressureless DM and DE, where the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with the scale factor $a$. Specifically, we consider two parametrizations: $\xi(a) = \xi_0 + \xi_a (1-a)$ and $\xi(a) = \xi_0 \left(1 + \frac{1-a}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} \right)$, and constrain them using the latest cosmological observations, including Planck 2018 CMB data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and multiple Type Ia supernovae samples. Our results show that one scenario yields evidence for a non-zero interaction at more than 95\% confidence level, while the remaining cases indicate at most mild or inconclusive signs of interaction. These findings highlight the potential of variable coupling models and the importance of continued investigation into the nature of the dark sectors.",
Cross submissions,Large $n$-point Functions in Resonant Inflation,"Paolo Creminelli,Sébastien Renaux-Petel,Giovanni Tambalo,Vicharit Yingcharoenrat",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate a qualitatively new regime of inflationary models with small and rapid oscillations in the potential--resonant non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the standard scenario, where most of the observable information is encoded in the power spectrum, in this regime the oscillatory signal predominantly appears in higher-order correlation functions with large $n$. This behavior emerges when the oscillation frequency $\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the theory, $4\pi f$. However, as noted by Hook and Rattazzi [2306.12489], the actual cutoff is somewhat higher--though only logarithmically--when the amplitude of the oscillations is small. We identify a phenomenologically relevant window in which $n$-point functions with $3 \lesssim n \lesssim 9$ are potentially observable. In this regime, the signal exhibits 350 - 1000 oscillations per decade in $k$.",
