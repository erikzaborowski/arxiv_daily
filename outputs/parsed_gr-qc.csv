New submissions,Spherical inspirals of spinning bodies into Kerr black holes,"Viktor Skoupý,Gabriel Andres Piovano,Vojtěch Witzany",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a stellar-mass compact object spiraling into a massive black hole, are key sources for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. Accurate modeling of these systems requires incorporating the spin effects of both the primary and secondary bodies, particularly for waveforms at the precision required for LISA detection and astrophysical parameter extraction. In this work, we develop a framework for modeling flux-driven spherical inspirals (orbits of approximately constant Boyer-Lindquist radius) of a spinning secondary into a Kerr black hole. We leverage recently found solutions for the motion of spinning test particles and compute the associated gravitational wave fluxes to linear order in the secondary spin. Next, we show that spherical orbits remain spherical under radiation reaction at linear order in spin, and derive the evolution of the orbital parameters throughout the inspiral. We implement a numerical scheme for waveform generation in the frequency domain and assess the impact of the secondary spin on the gravitational wave signal. In contrast to quasi-circular inspirals, we find that neglecting the secondary spin in spherical inspirals induces large mismatches in the waveforms that will plausibly be detectable by LISA.",
New submissions,The Persistence of Nonlinear Gravitational Wave Memory,Robert R. Caldwell,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Nonlinear gravitational wave memory is a surprise of theoretical physics. Whereas it is understood that a gravitational wave induces oscillatory squeezing and stretching motion in a collection of freely-falling test masses, it is unexpected that the wave leaves a residual displacement of the test masses. This displacement is the tribute in memoriam to the passing wave. The memory originates in a nonlinear feature of gravitation. Whilst merging black holes are a significant source of gravitational waves, the gravitational wave energy itself is a further source of gravitational waves. The memory is often described as a permanent displacement of the test masses caused by a burst of primary gravitational waves. But as we show, memory vanishes at late times in a sea of echoes.",
New submissions,Close Hyperbolic Encounters In f(R) Gravity,"Jenna Bruton,Peter Dunsby,Alvaro de la Cruz-Dombriz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission from black hole pairs on unbound orbits undergoing close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs) in dense astrophysical environments. While General Relativity predicts gravitational Bremsstrahlung radiation occurring at periastron, the contribution of the scalar gravitational-wave mode in fully general f(R) gravity remains largely unexplored. We characterize the f(R) scalar mode gravitational radiation for both non-precessing and precessing hyperbolic orbits, identifying potential detection signatures for advanced gravitational wave observatories. By systematically varying orbital precession and eccentricity, we examine their influence on the emitted gravitational waves. We derive potentially detectable time delay and scalar-to-tensor amplitude ratio estimates for representative astrophysical environments and determine optimal orbital configurations for the detection of f(R) scalar gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters. Our results provide a theoretical framework for scalar-mode signals and observables, establishing CHEs as a promising probe of f(R) gravity with future detectors.",
New submissions,Excising Cauchy Horizons with Nonlinear Electrodynamics,"Tomáš Hale,Robie A. Hennigar,David Kubiznak",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Charged and/or rotating black holes in General Relativity feature Cauchy horizons, which indicate a breakdown of predictability in the theory. Focusing on spherically symmetric charged black holes, we remark that the inevitability of Reissner-Nordstrom Cauchy horizon is due to the divergent electromagnetic self-energy of point charges. We demonstrate that any causal theory of nonlinear electrodynamics that regularizes the point charge self-energy also eliminates Cauchy horizons for weakly charged black holes. These black holes feature one (event) horizon and a spacelike singularity, analogous to the Schwarzschild metric. An example with Born-Infeld electrodynamics illustrates how this gives rise to an upper bound on the charge, which we compare with known bounds.",
New submissions,Exact vacuum solution with Hopf structure in general relativity,Junpei Harada,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"An exact solution to the vacuum Einstein equations is presented, whose structure is based on the Hopf fibration. The solution employs a geodesic null vector field that defines a twisting congruence and appears in the metric in Kerr-Schild form. This solution is of Petrov type D and involves two parameters. Remarkably, the resulting spacetime is regular, with no curvature singularities. Both the Kretschmann scalar and the Chern-Pontryagin scalar are nonzero and remain finite throughout the spacetime. In addition, the Newman-Penrose Weyl scalar $\Psi_2$ possesses both nonzero real and imaginary parts, reflecting the topologically nontrivial nature of the gravitational field. The spacetime also admits two Killing vector fields and a Killing-Yano tensor, which induces an associated Killing tensor, revealing its hidden symmetry. The derivation is simple and self-contained, offering a transparent and geometrically guided approach to finding new exact solutions in general relativity.",
New submissions,Analytical approach to criticality of AdS black holes,"Hong-Ming Cui,Zhong-Ying Fan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We establish a hidden symmetry between the specific volumes of the coexistent phases and hence develop an analytical approach to study criticality of AdS black holes. In particular, using the method, we solve the coexistence line exactly for a variety of black holes, including the charged AdS black hole (in the four and the five dimensions), the rotating AdS black hole, the Gauss-Bonnet black hole and the quantum BTZ black hole.",
New submissions,Phantom Crossing and Oscillating Dark Energy with $F(R)$ Gravity,"Shin'ichi Nojiri,S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realised in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint, considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behaviour and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realise an oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study quantitatively two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models, which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behaviour and oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by numerically solving the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity, which can naturally realise a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realise the phantom evolution.",
New submissions,Identification of Noise-Associated Glitches in KAGRA O3GK with Hveto,"T. Akutsu,M. Ando,M. Aoumi,A. Araya,Y. Aso,L. Baiotti,R. Bajpai,K. Cannon,A. H.-Y. Chen,D. Chen,H. Chen,A. Chiba,C. Chou,M. Eisenmann,K. Endo,T. Fujimori,S. Garg,D. Haba,S. Haino,R. Harada,H. Hayakawa,K. Hayama,S. Fujii,Y. Himemoto,N. Hirata,C. Hirose,H.-F. Hsieh,H.-Y. Hsieh,C. Hsiung,S.-H. Hsu,K. Ide,R.

Sato",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Transient noise (""glitches"") in gravitational wave detectors can mimic or obscure true signals, significantly reducing detection sensitivity. Identifying and excluding glitch-contaminated data segments is therefore crucial for enhancing the performance of gravitational-wave searches. We perform a noise analysis of the KAGRA data obtained during the O3GK observation. Our analysis is performed with hierarchical veto (Hveto) which identifies noises based on the statistical time correlation between the main channel and the auxiliary channels. A total of 2,531 noises were vetoed by 28 auxiliary channels with the configuration (i.e., signal-to-noise threshold set to 8) that we chose for Hveto. We identify vetoed events as glitches on the spectrogram via visual examination after plotting them with Q-transformation. By referring to the Gravity Spy project, we categorize 2,354 glitches into six types: blip, helix, scratchy, and scattered light, which correspond to those listed in Gravity Spy, and dot and line, which are not found in the Gravity Spy classification and are thus named based on their spectrogram morphology in KAGRA data. The remaining 177 glitches are determined not to belong to any of these six types. We show how the KAGRA glitch types are related to each subsystem of KAGRA. To investigate the possible correlation between the main channel and the round winner - an auxiliary channel statistically associated with the main channel for vetoing purposes - we visually examine the similarity or difference in the glitch pattern on the spectrogram. We compare the qualitative correlation found through visual examination with coherence, which is known to provide quantitative measurement for the correlation between the main channel and each auxiliary channel. Our comprehensive noise analysis will help improve the data quality of KAGRA by applying it to future KAGRA observation data.",
New submissions,Uncertainty Principles and Non-local Black Holes,"Salvatore Capozziello,Giuseppe Meluccio,Jonas R. Mureika",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We discuss the Generalized Uncertainty Principle and the Extended Uncertainty Principle in the context of black hole solutions coming from non-local theories of gravity, focusing, specifically, on Infinite Derivative Gravity. We argue that these modifications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are effective descriptions arising from the non-local features of gravitational interaction. By comparing the predictions of both the modified uncertainty principles and non-local gravity, we find theoretical constraints on otherwise free parameters as well as universal laws for black hole physics beyond General Relativity.",
New submissions,"Exploring Dark Energy via Non-Minimal Coupling in $f(Q,L_m)$ Gravity with Gong-Zhang Parameterization","Yash B. Ingole,K.V. Somwanshi,S.R. Bhoyar,S.N. Bayaskar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we investigate the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of non-minimally coupled $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar and $L_m$ is the matter Lagrangian. We derive modified Friedmann equations in a flat FLRW background and employ the \textit{Gong-Zhang} parameterization for the DE equation of state (EoS), allowing an analytical form of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. The model parameters are constrained using recent Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Pantheon+SH0ES Type Ia supernova datasets through MCMC-based chi-squared minimization. We analyze various cosmological quantities including the deceleration parameter, EoS, jerk, snap, lerk, and diagnostic tools such as $Om(z)$ and the statefinder pair $(r,s)$. Our findings indicate a viable transition from deceleration to acceleration and reveal a quintessence-to-phantom-like evolution of dark energy. Furthermore, energy conditions are examined, showing a violation of the strong energy condition, consistent with current cosmic acceleration. The results establish that the $f(Q,L_m) $ framework with non-minimal coupling and parameterized EoS provides a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.",
New submissions,Formation of Bound States in Quintessence Alternative Theories,"George Koutsoumbas,Andri Machattou,Eleftherios Papantonopoulos",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the formation and behaviour of bound states formed outside the horizon of a black hole in the presence of quintessence matter. Calculating the Regge and Wheeler potential for general metric function, we find that the presence of quintessence influences significantly the metric function and the Hawking temperature. We show that large black holes radiate less in the presence of large quintessence matter and it seems to live longer, while small black holes radiate more.",
New submissions,On the Dark-Energy Enigma,"Ali H. Chamseddine,Jürg Fröhlich",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lemaître universe are presented.",
New submissions,Exploring the role of accretion disk geometry in shaping black hole shadows,Zi-Liang Wang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We study black hole imaging in the context of geometrically thick accretion disks in Schwarzschild spacetime. By decomposing the emitting region into a set of one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination angle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image features-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach allows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three regimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks. For optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the photon ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its position robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the optically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first intersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical criteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical deflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified radiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\chi \sim (6M\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically thin- to thick-disk appearance. These results help clarify the respective roles of the photon and lensing rings across different disk configurations, and may offer a useful framework for interpreting future high-resolution black hole observations.",
New submissions,Systematic bias in LISA ringdown analysis due to waveform inaccuracy,"Lodovico Capuano,Massimo Vaglio,Rohit S. Chandramouli,Chantal L Pitte,Adrien Kuntz,Enrico Barausse",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inaccurate modeling of gravitational-wave signals can introduce systematic biases in the inferred source parameters. As detector sensitivities improve and signals become louder, mitigating such waveform-induced systematics becomes increasingly important. In this work, we assess the systematic biases introduced by an incomplete description of the ringdown signal from massive black hole binaries in the LISA band. Specifically, we investigate the impact of mode truncation in the ringdown template. Using a reference waveform composed of 13 modes, we establish a mode hierarchy and determine the minimum number of modes required to avoid parameter biases across a wide range of LISA sources. For typical systems with masses $\sim 10^6$--$10^7\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \sim 2$--$6$, we find that at least 3--6 modes are needed for accurate parameter estimation, while high-SNR events may need at least 10 modes. Our results are a window-insensitive lower bound on the minimum number of modes, as more modes may be needed depending on the choice of time-domain windowing of the post-merger signal.",
New submissions,Linear stability of Kerr black holes in the full subextremal range,"Dietrich Häfner,Peter Hintz,András Vasy",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"We prove, unconditionally, the linear stability of the Kerr family in the full subextremal range. On an analytic level, our proof is the same as that of our earlier paper in the slowly rotating case. The additional ingredients we use are, firstly, the mode stability result proved by Andersson, Whiting, and the first author and, secondly, computations related to the zero energy behavior of the linearized gauge-fixed Einstein equation in work by the second author.",
New submissions,Gravitational Wave Generation and Detection in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory,"Yuan-Kun Gao,Da Huang,Yue-Liang Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the production and detection of gravitational waves (GWs) within the framework of Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT). In this theory, GWs exhibit five propagating modes: one scalar, two vector, and two tensor modes. Unlike General Relativity, the gravitational field equations in GQFT involve both symmetric and antisymmetric tensors, governed by their respective energy-momentum tensors, both of which can act as sources for GW radiation. By solving the linearized gravitational equations, we derive general analytic expressions for the different GW degrees of freedom. Our analysis reveals that the symmetric energy-momentum tensor generates scalar and tensor GWs through the trace and traceless parts of the quadrupole moment, respectively. In contrast, the antisymmetric stress tensor induces scalar and vector GWs with enhanced coupling strengths. We examine two illustrative examples: a black hole binary with a slightly elliptical orbit, which produces scalar GWs, and a neutron star binary where one component has a net spin aligned with its velocity, leading to vector GW emission. Finally, we study the detectability of these GW polarizations by analyzing their signatures in GW detectors. Our findings indicate that current observatories can detect both scalar and tensor modes, while a newly designed detector would be required to probe vector GWs.",
New submissions,Peculiarities of quantum field theory in the presence of a wormhole,Mikhail N. Smolyakov,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, quantum theory of a real massive scalar field in the background of a traversable wormhole is examined. The wormhole is supposed to connect two different universes, as a particular example the simplest Ellis wormhole is considered. It is shown that the resulting theory possesses a doubling of quantum states parameterized by the same value of asymptotic momentum, two different sets of such degenerate states are localized in different universes. This is a consequence of the topological structure of the wormhole spacetime, which is the same as the topological structure of the Schwarzschild spacetime providing a similar degeneracy of quantum states.",
New submissions,Charged black holes surrounded by shells of charged particles,"David Fajman,Hannah Seer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),We construct new static solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov-Maxwell system. These solutions model Reissner-Nordstrom-type black holes with surrounding shells of charged matter.,
New submissions,Non-extensive and quasi-homogeneous black hole thermodynamics,Hernando Quevedo,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the thermodynamic properties of black holes, taking into account the non-extensivity of their entropy at the thermodynamic and statistical level. To this end, we interpret the Rényi entropy as determining the fundamental thermodynamic equation, which is represented by a quasi-homogeneous function. As a consequence, the Rényi parameter turns out to be an independent thermodynamic variable that must be treated in the framework of extended thermodynamics. As a particular example, we use the formalism of geometrothermodynamics to show that the Schwarzschild black hole can become stable for certain values of the Rényi parameter.",
New submissions,Towards Stochastic Inflation in Higher-Curvature Gravity,"Yermek Aldabergenov,Ding Ding,Wei Lin,Yidun Wan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study stochastic inflation in the presence of higher-curvature terms non-minimally coupled to the inflaton. Focusing on quadratic curvature invariants, we single out the Gauss--Bonnet term which is known to avoid ghosts, while having non-trivial effects on the background and scalar mode evolution when coupled to the scalar field. Stochastic Klein--Gordon and Langevin equations are derived in the presence of the Gauss--Bonnet coupling, and their slow-roll and ultra-slow-roll limits are studied. By using first-passage time method, scalar power spectrum is computed in these limits. Stochastic evolution of a Gauss--Bonnet-coupled spectator field in de Sitter vacuum is also discussed.",
New submissions,Supermassive black hole scalarization and effective field theory,"Farid Thaalba,Pedro G. S. Fernandes,Thomas P. Sotiriou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A model in which black hole scalarization occurs for supermassive black holes, while their less massive counterparts remain unscalarized, has been recently proposed. We explore whether this model can emerge from an effective field theory obtained by integrating out a heavy second scalar field. We show that the resulting EFT does not have the right coupling sign or the right hierarchy of scales. We then consider whether supermassive black hole scalarization could occur in theories with two scalars. We show that, although they can violate black hole uniqueness through curvature- and spin-induced scalarization, they do not naturally produce scalarization exclusively for supermassive black holes.",
New submissions,"Eisenhart-Duval lift, Nonlocal Conservation laws and Painlevé Analysis in Scalar field Cosmology",Andronikos Paliathanasis,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We investigate the existence of nonlocal conservation laws for the gravitational field equations of scalar field cosmology in an FLRW background with a dust fluid source. We perform such analysis by using a novel approach for the Eisenhart-Duval lift. It follows that the scalar field potential $V\left( \phi \right) =\alpha \left( e^{\lambda \phi }+\beta \right) $ admits nontrivial conservation laws. Furthermore, we employ the Painlevé analysis to examine the integrability of the field equations. For the quintessence model, we establish that the cosmological field equations possess the Painlevé property and are integrable for $\lambda ^{2}>6$. In contrast, for the phantom scalar field, the cosmological field equations exhibit the Painlevé property for any value of the parameter $% \lambda $. We present analytic solutions expressed in terms of Right Laurent expansions for various values of the parameter $\lambda $. Finally, we discuss the qualitative evolution of the effective equation of state parameter for these analytic solutions.",
Cross submissions,Covariant phase space and $L_\infty$ algebras,"Vinícius Bernardes,Theodore Erler,Atakan Hilmi Fırat",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a symplectic structure for the phase space of a generic Lagrangian field theory expressed in the framework of $L_\infty$ algebras. The symplectic structure does not require explicit knowledge of the derivative content of the Lagrangian, and therefore is applicable to nonlocal models, such as string field theory, where traditional constructions are difficult to apply. We test our proposal in a number of examples ranging from general relativity to $p$-adic string theory.",
Cross submissions,Dark Classification Matters: Searching for Primordial Black Holes with LSST,"Miguel Crispim Romao,Djuna Croon,Benedict Crossey,Daniel Godines",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.",
Cross submissions,Nowhere left to hide: revealing realistic gravitational-wave populations in high dimensions and high resolution with PixelPop,"Sofia Alvarez-Lopez,Jack Heinzel,Matthew Mould,Salvatore Vitale",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The origins of merging compact binaries observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave detectors remain uncertain, with multiple astrophysical channels possibly contributing to the merger rate. Formation processes can imprint nontrivial correlations in the underlying distribution of source properties, but current understanding of the overall population relies heavily on simplified and uncorrelated parametric models. In this work, we use PixelPop-a high-resolution Bayesian nonparametric model with minimal assumptions-to analyze multidimensional correlations in the astrophysical distribution of masses, spins, and redshifts of black-hole mergers from mock gravitational-wave catalogs constructed using population-synthesis simulations. With full parameter estimation on 400 detections at current sensitivities, we show explicitly that neglecting population-level correlations biases inference. In contrast, modeling all significant correlations with PixelPop allows us to correctly measure the astrophysical merger rate across all source parameters. We then propose a nonparametric method to distinguish between different formation channels by comparing the PixelPop results back to astrophysical simulations. For our simulated catalog, we find that only formation channels with significantly different physical processes are distinguishable, whereas channels that share evolutionary stages are not. Given the substantial uncertainties in source formation, our results highlight the necessity of multidimensional astrophysics-agnostic models like PixelPop for robust interpretation of gravitational-wave catalogs.",
Cross submissions,Nonlinear Gravitational Memory in the Post-Minkowskian Expansion,"Alessandro Georgoudis,Vasco Goncalves,Carlo Heissenberg,Julio Parra-Martinez",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present the first computation of the nonlinear gravitational memory waveform for the scattering of two compact objects in General Relativity at leading order in the post-Minkowskian expansion. We use the scattering-amplitudes-based representation of the gravitational waveform, which naturally expresses the nonlinear memory as the contribution of soft gravitons emitted by the gravitational waves themselves. We perform the calculation by applying a multipolar decomposition to the waveform and using the reverse unitarity method to obtain explicit exact-in-velocity predictions. We validate the results by calculating the corresponding velocity-expanded post-Newtonian multipoles, finding perfect agreement. Our results complete the knowledge of the gauge-invariant non-analytic-in-frequency part of the $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$ multipolar waveform, thus providing a useful benchmark for future calculations of this quantity.",
Cross submissions,The fate of Quasi-Exponential inflation in the light of ACT-DR6,Barun Kumar Pal,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We have revisited quasi-exponential model of inflation in the light of recent ACT-DR6 and Planck-2018 data along with latest constraint on the amplitude of primordial gravity waves. For our analysis we have followed Mukhanov approach for inflationary equation-of-state employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that the model is capable of mimicking Planck-2018 results by providing excellent fit to scalar spectral index and its running. Not only that, amount of primordial gravity waves is also in tune with the present observational bound, $r<0.032$. But, when constraints on scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are considered simultaneously quasi-exponential inflation fails to live up to the Planck-2018 result. However when the combination of ACT-DR6 and Planck-2018 data is taken into account inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model are in excellent agreement. The model also yields sublime fit to the result of joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data. Further the constraint on primordial gravity waves from the futuristic CMB missions in the likes of LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 when combined with ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data renders a first-class match with the inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model of inflation. However, non-detection of primordial gravity waves by LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 will potentially rule out quasi-exponential model.",
Cross submissions,Holography with Null Boundaries,"Christian Ferko,Savdeep Sethi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"One of the key issues in holography is going beyond $\mathrm{AdS}$ and defining quantum gravity in spacetimes with a null boundary. Recent examples of this type involve linear dilaton asymptotics and are related to the $T \overline{T}$ deformation. We present a holographic correspondence derived from string theory, which is an example of a kind of celestial holography. The holographic definition is a spacetime non-commutative open string theory supported on D1-D5 branes together with fundamental strings. The gravity solutions interpolate between $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ metrics and six-dimensional metrics. Radiation can escape to null infinity, which makes both the encoding of quantum information in the boundary and the dynamics of black holes quite different from $\mathrm{AdS}$ spacetimes.",
Cross submissions,A Black Hole is Born: 3D GRMHD Simulation of Black Hole Formation from Core-Collapse,"Goni Halevi,Swapnil Shankar,Philipp Mösta,Roland Haas,Erik Schnetter",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present the first three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulation of a black hole (BH) formed from the collapsed core of a massive star. The ability to self-consistently capture the birth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties (including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained elusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse, core-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar progenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a one-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45 M_\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from stellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The collapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km before stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron star accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t_{BH} \approx 325$ ms after core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably similar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the horizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity of $v_{kick} \approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M_{BH} \approx 2.62 M_\odot$, which is still rising at the end of the simulation.",
Cross submissions,Higgs pole inflation with loop corrections in light of ACT results,"Jeonghak Han,Hyun Min Lee,Jun-Ho Song",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present the Coleman-Weinberg potential for the inflaton in the pole inflation scenarios such as the Higgs pole inflation and the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) pole inflation. The loop corrections stem from the Standard Model particles and extra singlet scalar fields in the former case, making the quartic coupling for the Higgs inflaton modified by the inflaton-dependent power corrections during inflation. We also obtain similar power corrections to the quartic coupling for the PQ inflaton, depending on the realizations of the PQ symmetry in KSVZ and DFSZ models. We show that the loop corrections shift the spectral index in the pole inflation to a larger value in favor of the ACT results, while being compatible with the bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. For a positive one-loop beta function for the inflaton quartic coupling (namely, $b_1>0$), a sub-dominant contribution from the two-loop corrections can be accommodated. On the other hand, if the one-loop beta function for the inflaton coupling is negative (namely, $b_1<0$), we need sizable contributions from two-loops that are larger than the one-loop corrections due to the ACT results.",
Cross submissions,Constraint on Momentum-coupled Dark Energy using DESI DR2,"Prasanta Sahoo,Nandan Roy,Himadri Shekhar Mondal",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we study two scalar field driven dark energy models characterized by the axion potential and the inverse power law potential, each coupled to dark matter through a momentum exchange interaction. By formulating the dynamics as an autonomous system, we identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. To constrain these models, we utilize observational data from Pantheon Plus Type Ia Supernovae, DES Y5, DESI DR2 BAO, and Planck 2018 CMB compressed likelihood, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both potentials exhibit weak to strong preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a particularly strong preference for the momentum-coupled scenario when Supernova data are included in the analysis. Furthermore, we find the coupling parameter to be negative, with no lower bound, for both potentials. This suggests that momentum-exchange coupling between the dark sectors cannot be ruled out. From the stability analysis, we observe that for both potentials, the late-time attractor corresponds to a dark energy dominated phase, and the scalar field can behave as a stiff fluid during the early epoch.",
Cross submissions,Gravity Duality of Networks,"Yu Guo,Rong-Xin Miao",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The network has been attracting increasing attention for its role in driving the artificial intelligence revolution and enabling profound insights into gravity. This paper investigates the gravity dual of the conformal field theory defined on a network (AdS/NCFT). A typical network, consisting of edges and nodes, is dual to a spacetime with branches and connecting branes, which we refer to as Net-branes. We demonstrate that the junction condition on the Net-brane results in energy conservation at the network node, providing strong support for our proposal of AdS/NCFT.We find that the spectrum of gravitational Kaluza-Klein modes on the Net-brane is a combination of the spectra from the AdS/BCFT with Neumann boundary conditions and Dirichlet/Conformal boundary conditions, corresponding to the isolated and transparent modes, respectively. We study two-point functions for NCFTs and provide examples, such as free fields and AdS/NCFT with tensionless Net-branes. We propose that the RT surfaces intersect at the same point on the Net-brane for connected subsystems within the network and verify this with the strong additivity and monotonicity of entanglement entropy. We establish that the network entropy, defined as the difference in entanglement between NCFT and BCFT, is always non-negative and effectively illustrates the network's complexity. Finally, we briefly discuss the holographic perspective of the shortest path problem and reveal its relation to the shortest geodesic in bulk and the holographic two-point correlators of massive operators.",
Cross submissions,Multifaceted Supercooling: From PTA to LIGO,"Satyabrata Datta,Rome Samanta",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Supercooled phase transitions, as predicted, e.g., in near-conformal and confining extensions of the Standard Model (SM), are established sources of strong stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). In this work, we investigate another facet of such transitions: their significant and largely uncharted impact on gravitational wave spectra originating from independent cosmological sources. Focusing on gravitational waves produced by a metastable cosmic string network, we show that an intervening supercooled phase, initiating thermal inflation, can reshape and suppress the high-frequency part of the spectrum. This mechanism reopens regions of string parameter space previously excluded by LIGO's null results, while remaining compatible with the nanohertz SGWB signal reported by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The resulting total spectrum typically exhibits a dual-component structure, sourced by both string decay and the phase transition itself, rendering the scenario observationally distinctive. We systematically classify the viable parameter space and identify regions accessible to upcoming detectors such as Advanced LIGO, LISA, and ET.",
Cross submissions,Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK,Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.",
Cross submissions,Quasar cosmology II: joint analyses with Cosmic Microwave Background,"M. Benetti,G. Bargiacchi,G. Risaliti,S. Capozziello,E. Lusso,M. Signorini",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Currently, the increasing availability of accurate cosmological probes leads to the emergence of tensions between data on the one hand and between theoretical predictions and direct observations on the other. Moreover, after 25 years since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has elected the $\Lambda$CDM model as the reference model, resolving shortcomings of the standard cosmological model seems to be an unpostponed priority. Hence, it is key to test alternative models and investigate new cosmological probes at distances that range from the late to the early Universe, namely between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. Bargiacchi et al. (2022) for the first time analysed dark energy (DE) models using quasars (QSOs) while also testing their consistency with BAO. Here, we carry on by exploring the compatibility of QSOs with both CMB data and dark energy survey measurements against the standard cosmological model and some DE extensions, such as the $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisations. We also consider an interacting dark matter and vacuum energy scenario, where vacuum energy perturbations affect the evolution of the matter growth rate in a decomposed Chaplygin gas model. We implement the QSO probe in Cobaya Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, using Botzmann solver codes as Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) for the theory predictions. Our work shows that simple DE deviations from $\Lambda$CDM model do not reconcile the data and that only more complex models of interaction in the dark sector can succeed in solving the discrepancies of probes at all scales.",
Cross submissions,Observers and Timekeepers: From the Page-Wootters Mechanism to the Gravitational Path Integral,Zixia Wei,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Quantum gravity in a closed universe faces two a priori distinct yet seemingly related issues: the problem of time and the fact that its Hilbert space dimension is one. Both have been argued to be resolvable by formulating physics relative to an observer. Using a simple gravitational path integral model, we explain that the two issues arise from two distinct non-perturbative effects: the former from summing over metrics and the latter from summing over topologies. We then revisit the Page-Wootters mechanism, one of the earliest frameworks for formulating quantum mechanics relative to an observer, see how it applies to both issues, and introduce some new ingredients. In particular, we emphasize a hierarchy between an observer and a timekeeper. An observer is a subsystem of the universe whose specification results in a nontrivial Hilbert space, while a timekeeper is an observer with a specified history that can be used as a reference for the time of the environment and experiences a nontrivial time evolution. Finally, we propose a method for incorporating observers and timekeepers into the gravitational path integral and show that implementing a timekeeper in this way furnishes an observer-dependent generalization of holography.",
Cross submissions,Detectability and Parameter Estimation for Einstein Telescope Configurations with GWJulia,"Andrea Begnoni,Stefano Anselmi,Mauro Pieroni,Alessandro Renzi,Angelo Ricciardone",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are expected to detect tens of thousands of compact binary coalescences (CBC) per year, depending also on the final detectors layout. For this reason, it is essential to have a fast, reliable tool for forecasting how different detector layouts will affect parameter estimation for these events. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is a common tool for tackling this problem. In this paper, we present a new open source code GWJulia to perform FIM analysis of CBC parameters, i.e., stellar black-hole binaries (BBH), neutron star binaries (BNS), and neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH). The code is purely written in Julia, making it fast while maintaining a high level of accuracy. We consider a set of case studies to compare different Einstein Telescope (ET) designs. We compare a 10km triangular configuration with two 15km L-shaped detectors with different orientations and temperatures. We discuss also the accuracy of combinations of parameters, which is very informative for cosmology or population studies. Finally, we focus on the detection of golden events and explore how the FIM can guide posterior sampling of GW signals using a novel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler.
