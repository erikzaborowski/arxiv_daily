New submissions,Stable models in lower dimensions within the quadratic form of the non-metricity theory,"G.G.L. Nashed,Salvatore Capozziello",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This work investigates exact charged and uncharged black hole solutions in a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime within the framework of the quadratic form of the symmetric teleparallel theory, known as $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar. By employing a spherically symmetric ansatz and considering both vanishing and non-vanishing electromagnetic fields, we derive new classes of black hole solutions and analyze their geometric and physical properties. The study demonstrates that the inclusion of the quadratic correction term in the gravitational Lagrangian significantly modifies the structure of the solutions, producing deviations from the standard BTZ geometry. Invariants such as curvature and non-metricity scalars are calculated to classify the singularity structure and spacetime behavior. Thermodynamic quantities, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, are computed, showing consistency with the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we examine the geodesic motion of test particles and derive the effective potential to explore the stability of photon orbits. A notable outcome is the identification of weaker black hole singularities in comparison to general relativity, attributed to the non-metricity corrections. The possibility of multi-horizon configurations is also explored. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the gravitational, thermodynamic, and dynamical features of lower-dimensional black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity and highlights their distinct characteristics relative to general relativity.",
New submissions,The ''Telephone Game'' Effect in Modern Gravity Research,Andronikos Paliathanasis,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Triggered by some recent studies within the framework of nonmetricity gravity, I discuss how the basic information regarding the equivalence of the gravitational theories forming the \textquotedblleft Trinity of Gravity\textquotedblright\ has been lost in parts of the literature. As a result, several studies with focus in modified theories of gravity have research investigated the case of STEGR/GR, often without acknowledging this fundamental equivalence or recognizing that their results can be derived in GR",
New submissions,A Black Hole Solution in Kalb-Ramond Gravity with Quintessence Field: From Geodesic Dynamics to Thermal Criticality,"Ahmad Al-Badawi,Faizuddin Ahmed,İzzet Sakallı",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a theoretical investigation of black hole solutions in Kalb-Ramond gravity embedded with quintessence fields. Our study examines how combined effects of Lorentz violation through the Kalb-Ramond field parameter $\eta$ and exotic matter contributions via quintessence parameters $(\mathrm{C}, w)$ systematically modify spacetime geometry, particle dynamics, and observational signatures compared to standard Schwarzschild black holes. The analysis encompasses geodesic motion for both photons and massive particles, revealing substantial modifications to effective potentials, photon sphere characteristics, and innermost stable circular orbit properties. We derive analytical expressions for black hole shadow radii across different quintessence states, demonstrating systematic parameter dependencies enabling observational discrimination between theoretical frameworks. Our perturbation analysis of scalar and electromagnetic fields shows how Lorentz violation and quintessence effects alter wave propagation and stability properties. Using Gauss-Bonnet theorem methodology, we calculate gravitational lensing deflection angles incorporating both modified gravity and exotic matter contributions. The thermodynamic investigation reveals complex phase structures with modified Hawking temperature evolution, Gibbs free energy characteristics, and specific heat capacity behavior significantly deviating from general relativity predictions. Lorentz violation amplifies gravitational effects, whereas quintessence exerts counteractive forces, generating complex parameter spaces allowing precise manipulation of observable quantiti",
New submissions,Gravitational baryogenesis in $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow,Parviz Goodarzi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the gravitational baryogenesis scenario within the context of $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow which incorporates both modified gravity and energy-dependent spacetime. This study explores a mechanism for generating baryon asymmetry based on the interaction between the derivative of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the baryon current within the framework of $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow. The rainbow functions, arising from quantum gravity effects, modify the gravitational interaction and the Friedmann equations, leading to a distinct evolution of the baryon asymmetry compared to standard $F(R)$ gravity. We analyze the conditions under which a viable baryon asymmetry can be produced, taking into account the constraints from cosmological observations and the specific form of the $F(R)$ function. By examining the cosmological equations in the context of $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow, we obtain power-law solutions for these equations. We also identify the decoupling temperature and the ratio of baryonic number to entropy density in this model, depending on the model's parameters. First, we discuss the acceptable intervals of the model's parameters which are defined by constraints on the background quantity. We note that the decoupling temperature and the ratio of baryon-to-entropy in these models depend on the value of the rainbow function. We compare the predictions of this model with the existing observational data. Our results suggest that $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow provides a novel mechanism for gravitational baryogenesis, potentially explaining the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe while incorporating quantum gravity corrections.",
New submissions,Testing the Dark Universe through the Layzer-Irvine Equation,Cláudio Gomes,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We review the cosmic generalisation of the virial theorem known as the Layzer-Irvine equation, also independently derived by Dmitriev and Zeldovich. This equation has been studied in the literature for dark matter-dark energy interaction models, as well as in the context of alternative theories of gravity. We discuss results from the previous scenarios and point out future directions.",
New submissions,Are the Circular Polarizations of Observed Gravitational-Waves Even-Handed?,"Elena Emtsova,Ofek Birnholtz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study whether gravitational waves (GWs) from binary black hole (BBH) mergers show a difference between right- and left-handed circular polarizations. Such a difference could point to a violation of parity symmetry in gravity. We analyze publicly available data from the collaboration of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors, focusing on events with accurate sky localization using all three detectors. This allows us to separate the circular polarization modes and measure their amplitudes. Out of 15 well-localized events, 7 show a dominant right-handed mode and 8 a left-handed one. This small difference is consistent with statistical fluctuations. A Bayesian analysis shows that the probability $ p_R $ of a right-handed signal follows a $Beta(8,9)$ distribution, with no strong evidence for asymmetry. We also estimate how many future events would be needed to detect a small asymmetry like $p_R = 7 / 15$ with high confidence. To reach 2$\sigma$ or 3$\sigma$ significance, about 900 to 2000 well-localized events would be required. These numbers could be reached in upcoming observation runs. Our results support parity symmetry for now, but future data may allow us to test it more precisely.",
New submissions,Rigorous calculation of scalar scattering in Schwarzschild background: the convergence of partial-wave series and Poisson spot,"Zhao Li,Wen Zhao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Black hole (BH) perturbation theory and the scattering models provide a powerful framework for studying gravitational lensing at the wave-optics level. However, conventional calculations encountered two issues: the divergence of the partial-wave series and the divergence of the Poisson spot near the optical axis. These issues hinder the accurate calculation of lensed waveforms and the study of polarization and wave characteristics in the lensing process, especially near the optical axis. This work demonstrates that both divergences stem from the asymptotic expansion of the radial wave function. By computing the scattered wave function at finite radii and avoiding the asymptotic expansion, we naturally obtain convergent results. We compute scalar waves scattered by (1) a weak-gravity body with Newtonian potential and (2) a Schwarzschild BH with Regge-Wheeler potential. In both cases, we analyze the convergence of the partial-wave series and present finite-luminosity diffraction patterns, with a bright Poisson spot. The above calculations are compared with the Kirchhoff diffraction integral in the near-axis regions and give consistent results. Our investigations provide a foundation for studying gravitational wave scattering by BHs and understanding lensing at the wave-optics level.",
New submissions,Charge constraint on M87* with twisted light,"Fabiano Feleppa,Fabrizio Tamburini,Gaetano Lambiase",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We propose a novel method to constrain the electric charge of the supermassive black hole M87* by analyzing the orbital angular momentum content of the light it emits. By leveraging the established analogy between rotating spacetimes and inhomogeneous optical media, we derive a simple analytical formula that relates the average orbital angular momentum in the observed radiation to the black hole's charge-to-mass ratio. Applying this relation to existing observational data, we place an upper bound of $\mathcal{Q}/M \lesssim 0.39$ on the charge of M87*. While the analysis focuses on electric charge, which is used here purely as a theoretical example since astrophysical black holes are expected to be approximately neutral, the method is general and can be extended to constrain other types of charges $\unicode{x2013}$ degrees of freedom that define distinct black hole solutions. These results demonstrate the potential of orbital angular momentum as a new fundamental degree of freedom to be exploited in astrophysics, providing a complementary and independent alternative to shadow-based techniques for probing the properties of rotating compact objects and testing gravity in the strong-field regime.",
New submissions,Parameterized Evolution of the Kretschmann Scalar in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker Cosmology with Torsion Contributions and Big Rip Model,"Tahia F. Dabash,M.A. Bakry",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the Kretschmann scalar within the framework of Parameterized Absolute Parallelism (PAP) geometry, extending the classical understanding of spacetime curvature in General Relativity by incorporating torsion. This extension introduces a dimensionless parameter b, allowing a continuous interpolation between Riemannian geometry (b = 0) and Weitzenbock geometry (b = 1). Using the pseudo-Riemannian metric associated with Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, we derive an explicit expression for the modified Kretschmann scalar, which captures contributions from standard curvature, curvature-torsion interactions, and pure torsion. Our analysis reveals that the modified scalar reduces to the classical value under specific conditions (b = 0 or b = +/- sqrt(2)), while deviations occur for other b values. This work highlights the potential role of torsion in early-universe dynamics and provides a framework for exploring deviations from standard General Relativity in cosmological models, such as the Big Bang-Big Rip model (BRM).Keywords: Gravity; Torsion; Kretschmann scalar; BRM.

New submissions,Importance of relativistic pericenter precession in identifying the presence of a third body near eccentric binaries,"Pankaj Saini,Lorenz Zwick,János Takátsy,Connar Rowan,Kai Hendriks,Gaia Fabj,Daniel J. D'Orazio,Johan Samsing",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Many astrophysical processes can produce gravitational wave (GW) sources with significant orbital eccentricity. These binaries emit bursts of gravitational radiation during each pericenter passage. In isolated systems, the intrinsic timing of these bursts is solely determined by the properties of the binary. The presence of a nearby third body perturbs the system and alters the burst timing. Accurately modeling such perturbations therefore offers a novel approach to detecting the presence of a nearby companion. Existing timing models account for Newtonian dynamics and leading-order radiation reaction effects but neglect the higher order post-Newtonian (PN) contributions to the inner binary. In this paper, we present an improved timing model that incorporates conservative PN corrections that lead to the precession of the binary's pericenter. We find that these PN corrections significantly impact the binary's orbital evolution and the timing of the GW burst. In particular, 1PN precession gives rise to distinctive modulation features in the binary's semilatus rectum and eccentricity. These modulations encode valuable information about the presence and properties of the third body, including its mass and distance. Furthermore, unmodeled 1PN effects significantly bias the tertiary's mass and distance. Finally we assess the detectability of GW bursts from such perturbed systems and demonstrate that the inclusion of PN corrections is crucial for accurately capturing the orbital dynamics of hierarchical triples.",
New submissions,Confronting Rainbow-deformed $f(R)$ Gravity with the ACT Data,"S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we examine a theoretical scenario which combines two fundamental theoretical proposals for the early Universe and a possible evolution for the early post-inflationary epoch. Specifically, we assume that the early Universe contains gravity's rainbow effects on the spacetime and the inflationary Lagrangian contains $R^2$ corrections or $f(R)$ gravity corrections in general. In addition we assume that the era beyond the end of inflation until the reheating temperature is reached, is a kination era. Both theories, $R^2$ and gravity's rainbow emerge from a quantum context so their effects should be first checked at the theory which connects the quantum with the classical, hence inflation. Spacetime is four dimensional and the effects of the quantum theory could possibly be imprinted in the inflationary Lagrangian and of course on the spacetime itself. For the gravity's rainbow deformed Starobinsky model, both Lagrangian quantum effects and spacetime quantum effects are combined. As we show the resulting theory is compatible with the ACT data. We also consider power-law $f(R)$ gravity deformations and we show that in this case, the model is viable without the need of extending the slow-roll era of inflation.",
New submissions,Strong Gravity Effects on $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected Single Scalar Field Inflation and Compatibility with the ACT Data,V.K. Oikonomou,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we introduce the rescaled $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected minimally coupled scalar field theory, a theory that contains minimal quantum corrections of the single scalar field Lagrangian. We develop the theoretical framework in the string frame where the baryons geodesics are free fall geodesics and we do not treat the theory as a two scalar field theory in the Einstein frame. The theoretical framework can be reduced to a single scalar field theory framework by using a perturbative expansion at the level of the field equations, making the resulting theory easy to tackle analytically. The first two quantum corrections contain two terms, a linear $\sim \mathcal{R}$ and a quadratic term $\sim \mathcal{R}^2$. The effect of the linear term alters the Einstein-Hilbert term, making the resulting theory a rescaled version of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Due to the presence of the rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term $\sim \lambda \frac{\mathcal{R}}{16\pi G}$, the gravitational constant will no longer be that of Newton's, but a rescaled one $\frac{G}{\lambda}$ and hence gravity can be stronger primordially, or even weaker. The perspective of having stronger gravity primordially, is compatible with intuition, since one expects a stronger gravity primordially, but having a weaker gravity for some reason is not prohibited theoretically. The attribute of our theoretical framework is that it allows a stronger gravity primordially, which returns to ordinary gravity as the curvature of the Universe decreases. We examine the effects of the quantum terms on several mainstream scalar field inflationary potentials, such as hybrid inflation, monomial inflation and power-law inflation.",
New submissions,Light Curves of Chaotic Charged Hot-Spots in Curved Spacetime: Opening an Observational Window to Chaos,"Shiyang Hu,Dan Li,Chen Deng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The observed scarcity of chaotic phenomena in astronomy contrasts sharply with their theoretical significance, primarily due to the absence of a robust framework for detecting chaos. In this study, we numerically simulate the light curves of hot-spots in Kerr spacetime under the influence of an external asymptotically uniform electromagnetic field. Our results reveal a clear distinction between the light curves of chaotic and regular hot-spots, particularly in their power spectra: the latter display isolated, sharp peaks, while the former exhibit broad, continuous peaks of low amplitude. These findings highlight the potential of using light curves as a probe for chaotic orbits in curved spacetime.",
New submissions,Quantum aspects of spacetime: A quantum optics view of acceleration radiation and black holes,"C. R. Ordonez,A. Chakraborty,H. E. Camblong,M. O. Scully,W. G. Unruh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"For the centennial of quantum mechanics, we offer an overview of the central role played by quantum information and thermalization in problems involving fundamental properties of spacetime and gravitational physics. This is an open area of research still a century after the initial development of formal quantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the description of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be highlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively addresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime backgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this review article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum features of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black holes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of the role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also shows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics.",
New submissions,Weak Lensing Approximation of Wave-optics Effects from General Symmetric Lens Profiles,"Zhao-Feng Wu,Otto A. Hannuksela,Martin Hendry,Quynh Lan Nguyen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational lensing of electromagnetic (EM) waves has yielded many profound discoveries across fundamental physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics (WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform. These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits. Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic content, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter.",
New submissions,Role of cosmic voids and their matter properties in shaping wormhole geometry in generalized geometry-matter coupling gravity,"A. Errehymy,S. Hansraj",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmic voids are increasingly recognized as a promising tool for cosmological exploration. Their distribution and density profiles are highly responsive to alterations in gravitational theories, along with the influences of dark energy and neutrinos. Investigating voids offers a compelling opportunity to uncover signatures of alternative gravity models on a cosmological level. Voids span a notable range of density contrasts, from approximately -$1$ near their centers to around $0$ at their edges, where screening mechanisms become less effective. The primary objective of this study is to explore a novel model that introduces a new category of wormhole solutions by leveraging cosmic voids$-$vast underdense regions of the universe$-$for the first time. We focus on identifying new exact static wormhole models by proposing an alternative viewpoint on their matter content, rooted in the recently formulated $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m,T)$ theory of gravity. By developing a unique solution based on a universal density profile for voids, we examine crucial constraints on the parameters that dictate matter distribution and the structure of spacetime itself. Our results reveal how these cosmic voids significantly influence the geometry of wormholes, steepening the gradient toward the throat and mitigating violations of the null and weak energy conditions, particularly beyond their centers. We also highlight intriguing gravitational lensing effects, showing that this wormhole repels light rather than capturing it, creating a fascinating interaction between gravity and light.",
New submissions,Testing the weak cosmic censorship conjecture via test particle induced overcharging/overspinning of Kerr Newman modified gravity black hole,"Waqar Ahmad,Abdul Rehman Kashif",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) violation through the absorption of a charged, rotating test particle by Kerr Newman spacetime in modified gravity (KN MOG). The result is sensitive to multiple factors, including the sign of the particle's charge relative to that of the black hole, as well as the direction of rotation of the particle and the black hole. Additionally, the combined effect of the MOG parameter, the black hole's charge and angular momentum plays a significant role. Taking all these into account, we have determined the range of the particle's charge, angular momentum and energy of the particle for which the event horizon disappears. Our analysis shows that the WCCC can be violated in both extremal and non extremal KN MOG black hole, provided the particle's parameters are small and precisely adjusted. Crucially, prior work by [1] discussed the WCCC in KN spacetime without considering the modified gravity parameter {\alpha}. In contrast, our study shows that incorporating {\alpha} significantly enlarges the range of permissible parameters for the test particle, leading to the violation of the WCCC in both extremal and non extremal KN MOG black holes.",
New submissions,Perturbations of massless external fields on magnetically charged black holes in string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg theory,"Xufen Zhang,De-Cheng Zou,Chao-Ming Zhang,Ming Zhang,Rui-Hong Yue",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we study the perturbations of massless scalar and electromagnetic fields on the magnetically charged black holes in string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg theory. We calculate the quasinormal frequencies (QNFs) and discuss influences of black hole magnetic charge $Q_m$, coupling parameter $\epsilon$ and angular momentum $l$ on QNFs, emphasizing the relationship between these parameters and QNMs behavior. We find these results obtained through the AIM method are in good agreement with those of obtained by WKB method. The greybody factor is calculated by WKB method. The effects of these parameters $Q_m$ and $\epsilon$ on the greybody factor are also studied.",
New submissions,Probing Effective Black Hole Deformations,Stefan Hohenegger,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In recent works, a framework has been developed to describe (quantum) deformed, spherically symmetric and static black holes in four dimensions. The key idea of this so-called Effective Metric Description (EMD) is to parametrise deformations of the classical Schwarzschild geometry by two functions that depend on a physical quantity and which are calculated in a self-consistent way as series expansions in the vicinity of the horizon. In this work we further strengthen this framework by first demonstrating that the corresponding series expansion coefficients can be completely and uniquely determined from measurements that are accessible for observers outside of the event horizon: we propose a Gedankenexperiment, consisting of probes following a free-falling trajectory that send signals to a stationary observer and show how an EMD can be constructed from suitable telemetric data. Furthermore, by linking the expansion coefficients of the EMD to the invariant eigenvalues of the energy momentum tensor, we determine a system of physical fields that provides an effective Einstein equation for the deformed black hole geometry. In the case of a simplified geometry and assuming that the metric deformations are small, we can write the leading order of the physical fields in a closed form in the metric functions. We illustrate our results at the example of the Hayward space-time.",
New submissions,Quantum Cosmology in Accelerating Spacetimes,"S. P. Miao,N. C. Tsamis,R. P. Woodard",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),We simplify the gravitational equations which apply in accelerating spacetimes and are consistent with the cosmological principle. Solutions to these equations should be tantamount to all order re-summations of the perturbative leading logarithms. We discuss the null hypothesis and we study the local expansion rate observable.,
New submissions,Exact Solutions for a Teleparallel Cosmological Model with Vector Field via Noether Symmetry,"Yusuf Kucukakca,Fereshteh Omidvar,Amin Rezaei Akbarieh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study a cosmological model in the framework of teleparallel gravity, where a vector field $A_\mu$ is non-minimally coupled to the torsion scalar $T$ in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. Using the Noether symmetry approach, we identify specific forms for the coupling function $g(\xi)$ and the potential $V(\xi) = V_0 \xi^n$, with $\xi \equiv A_\mu A^\mu$. The method allows us to find exact analytical solutions for the scale factor $a(t)$ and the scalar function $\xi(t)$. General solutions for arbitrary values of $n$ are derived, but special cases such as $n = 1$ and $n = 3$ are studied separately due to their distinct behavior. For $n = 1$, the model describes a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion, and depending on the value of the model parameter, a transition to a phantom phase is also possible, which is consistent with phantom dark energy. For the special case $n=3$, this model first experiences a deceleration phase and then enters a stable accelerating phase, such that the acceleration parameter $q(t)$ changes from positive to negative values and the equation of state parameter $\omega_\xi(t)$ tends to $-1$ at late times, similar to quintessence dark energy. Unlike the case $n=1$, in this case, no transition to the phantom phase is observed. Therefore, this model can describe the behavior of the universe during periods of dark energy dominance.",
New submissions,Sculpting Spacetime: Thin Shells in Wormhole Physics,Francisco S. N. Lobo,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we employ the Darmois-Israel thin-shell formalism to construct both static and dynamic thin-shell configurations surrounding traversable wormholes. Initially, using the cut-and-paste technique, we perform a linearized stability analysis in the presence of a general cosmological constant. Our results show that for sufficiently large positive values of the cosmological constant, corresponding to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry, the stability regions of the wormhole solutions are significantly enhanced compared to the Schwarzschild case. Subsequently, we construct static thin-shell solutions by matching an interior wormhole geometry to an exterior vacuum spacetime across a junction surface. In the spirit of minimizing the presence of exotic matter, we identify parameter domains in which the null and weak energy conditions are satisfied at the shell. We examine the surface stress-energy components in detail, determining regions where the tangential surface pressure is either positive or negative, interpreted, respectively, as the pressure or surface tension. Additionally, an expression describing the behavior of the radial pressure across the junction is derived. Finally, we determine key geometrical characteristics of the wormhole, including the throat radius and the junction interface radius, by imposing traversability conditions. Estimates for the traversal time and required velocity are also provided, further elucidating the physical viability of these configurations.",
New submissions,Log translation invariance of log soft gravitational radiation,"Gianni Boschetti,Miguel Campiglia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),The gravitational radiation emitted during a classical scattering process is known to exhibit two universal logarithmic terms in its soft frequency expansion. We show that these terms can be written in a way that makes the action of \emph{logarithmic translations} manifest. Invariance under log translations naturally explains a puzzling cancellation in the contribution from outgoing massless particles and leads to a recurrence relation for expected higher-order universal log soft terms.,
New submissions,Quantum nature of gravitational waves from binary black holes,"Sugumi Kanno,Jiro Soda,Akira Taniguchi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Quantum mechanics is the fundamental framework of nature, and gravitational waves from binary black holes should likewise be analyzed quantum mechanically. It is commonly assumed that their classical description corresponds to a coherent state, so any deviation would signal genuinely quantum nature of gravity. We show that the coherent-state description reproduces classical gravitational waves at leading order, while next-order effects generate squeezed states of gravitons. For GW150914, we estimate the squeezing parameter to be $\sim 10^{-3}$. Detection of such squeezing with LIGO, Virgo, or KAGRA would provide direct evidence for the quantization of gravity.",

Although being a highly nonlinear event, second-order perturbation theory suffices and that nonlinearities may be derived by a simple bootstrapping procedure.",
New submissions,"Anisotropic Spacetimes in $f(G)$-gravity: Bianchi I, Bianchi III and Kantowski-Sachs Cosmologies","R. Bogadi,A. Giacomini,M. Govender,C. Hansraj,G. Leon,A. Paliathanasis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We investigate the evolution of cosmological anisotropies within the framework of $f\left(G\right)$-gravity. Specifically, we consider a locally rotationally symmetric geometry in four-dimensional spacetime that describes the Bianchi I, Bianchi III, and the Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes. Within this context, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier which allows us to reformulate the geometric degrees of freedom in terms of a scalar field. The resulting theory is dynamically equivalent to an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field model. We normalize the field equations by introducing dimensionless variables. The dynamics of our system is then explored by solving the resulting nonlinear differential equations numerically for various sets of initial conditions. Our analysis reveals the existence of two finite attractors: the Minkowski universe and an isotropic, spatially flat solution capable of describing accelerated expansion. Although de Sitter expansion may be recovered, it appears only as an unstable solution. In addition, the theory suffers from the existence of Big Rip singularities.",
New submissions,Horizonless star based on regular black hole with finite radius and its observational signatures,"M. F. Fauzi,B. N. Jayawiguna,H. S. Ramadhan,A. Sulaksono",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The horizonless configuration of regular black holes has recently attracted attention as a model for ultracompact stars. In this paper, we propose a new class of regular black hole models sourced by a de Sitter vacuum with a finite radius. We focus on studying its horizonless configuration, which is modified into an anisotropic gravastar by proposing an ansatz of equation of states. We confirm that an anisotropic gravastar approaching horizon formation must violate the dominant energy condition. We also found that the proposed object has an effectively similar structure as a frozen star on the time geometry at the extremal configuration. From the proposed model, we investigate the photon geodesics inside the object and predict the optical appearance of the object surrounded by a thin accretion disk. Our imaging results indicate that, assuming light does not interact with the object's interior, its optical appearance differs from that of a thin-shell gravastar. ``Chaotic"" photon ring merges for $x>x_{m}$, where $x_{m}$ represents the minimum value required for the photon sphere to exist. In addition to its optical appearance, we investigate the axial gravitational perturbations emitted by this horizonless star. Notably, echo trains are found to exist for $x>x_{m}$, as determined by numerically solving the time-dependent Regge-Wheeler equation. By comparing the echo time with the GW170817 observation, we find that a frequency of 72 Hz can be achieved, albeit at the cost of requiring a relatively high value of $\ell$.",

In this paper, we describe the methods employed to produce the catalog's fourth release, GWTC-4.0, focusing on the analysis of the first part of the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA.",

In this new data, we find 128 new compact binary coalescence candidates that are identified by at least one of our search algorithms with a probability of astrophysical origin $p_{\rm astro} \geq 0.5$ and that are not vetoed during event validation. We also provide detailed source property measurements for 86 of these that have a false alarm rate $< 1 \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Based on the inferred component masses, these new candidates are consistent with signals from binary black holes and neutron star-black hole binaries (GW230518_125908 and GW230529_181500). Median inferred component masses of binary black holes in the catalog now range from $5.79\,M_\odot$ (GW230627_015337) to $137\,M_\odot$ (GW231123_135430), while GW231123_135430 was probably produced by the most massive binary observed in the catalog. For the first time we have discovered binary black hole signals with network signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 30, GW230814_230901 and GW231226_01520, enabling high-fidelity studies of the waveforms and astrophysical properties of these systems. Combined with the 90 candidates included in GWTC-3.0, the catalog now contains 218 candidates with $p_{\rm astro} \geq 0.5$ and not otherwise vetoed, doubling the size of the catalog and further opening our view of the gravitational-wave Universe.",

The sensitivity of these approaches is set by the initial search and by the number of candidates from that stage that can be followed-up. The current follow-up schemes for the deepest surveys require careful tuning and set-up, have a significant human-labor cost and this impacts the number of follow-ups that can be afforded. Here we present and demonstrate a new follow-up framework based on Bayesian parameter estimation for the rapid, highly automated follow-up of candidates produced by the early stages of deep, wide-parameter space searches for continuous waves.",
Cross submissions,Decoherence from the light bending interaction,"T. Bazylewicz,M. Szczepanik,J. Kłos,J. K. Korbicz",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyse a decoherence effect, caused by the gravitational interaction between a massive body and the electromagnetic field. Assuming a quantum version of the light bending interaction, we show that it leads to decoherence of the mass if the light is not observed. Using the extreme weakness of the gravitational coupling, we derive explicitly the decoherence lengthscales for general states of the central mass and for both thermal and coherent light. Predictably, the effect is very faint for anything but hugely energetic light, however from the fundamental point of view of co-existence of both gravitation and quantum theories, it is there. Since effectively the studied system is a quantum optomechanical system, we hope our results, properly rescaled, will be also useful in optomechanics.",

Santos",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We numerically construct asymptotically global $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ black holes in type IIB supergravity, with $\mathbb{R}_t \times SO(2) \times SO(3) \times U(1)^4$ symmetry, localised on the $\mathrm{S}^3$ and translationally invariant along the torus. These solutions, with horizons whose spatial cross sections have $\mathrm{S}^4 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ topology, dominate the microcanonical ensemble at low energies. At higher energies, a first-order phase transition occurs to $\mathrm{BTZ} \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ black holes $-$ possessing $\mathbb{R}_t \times SO(2) \times SO(4) \times U(1)^4$ symmetry and $\mathrm{S}^1 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ horizon topology. By the AdS/CFT correspondence, this transition reflects the spontaneous breaking of the $SO(4)$ R-symmetry of the D1-D5 CFT$_2$ to $SO(3)$. We also compute the expectation value of the scalar operator with lowest conformal dimension in the low-energy phase. Our $SO(3)$-localised black holes $-$ together with the $U(1)^2$-localised solutions of [1] $-$ point to a rich landscape of novel black holes that may approach the $\mathrm{CFT}_2$ sparseness bootstrap condition, and shed light on how macroscopic entanglement in thermal phases encodes microscopic structure via internal directions.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational currents and charges from conformal Killing-Yano tensors,"Chris Hull,Ulf Lindström,Maxwell L. Velásquez Cotini Hutt",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We construct a set of higher-form conserved currents on spacetimes admitting conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We find relations between these currents that allow the charge given by integrating one of these currents over a region to be re-expressed as an integral of a covariant quantity over the boundary. In many cases, only a non-covariant form of the boundary integral was previously known. For a special class of these currents the conservation does not rely on field equations, so they give conserved topological charges in any gravitational theory. We discuss the relation of our currents to the Komar current and derive several new properties of conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We study a number of applications of our construction to charges of black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory, and D-brane solutions of type II supergravity.",

Often, they possess screening mechanisms which allow the fifth force mediated by the additional scalar degree(s) of freedom to evade detection from local experiments. Their classical behaviour is well studied, but their quantum nature is relatively unexplored. We outline a Green's function method for obtaining the leading-order quantum corrections to the classical symmetron field profile in the vicinity of a spherically symmetric extended source. For parameters that experiments had previously ruled out, our calculations indicate that the symmetron force may be weaker than the classical field suggests.",
Cross submissions,"$\textit{BMAD}$-Circumbinary Magnetically Arrested Disks around Stellar or Black Hole Binaries: Hot Accretion Flows, Disk Properties, and Angular Momentum Transfer","Hai-Yang Wang,Elias R. Most,Philip F. Hopkins",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Binary systems surrounded by a circumbinary accretion flow can be subject to strong magnetic fields, potentially altering the character of the accretion flow itself, the evolution of the orbital dynamics, and outflow properties from the system. Here we focus on a regime where magnetic fields become so strong that the outer circumbinary flow becomes magnetically arrested, establishing a (circum)binary magnetically arrested disk ($\textit{BMAD}$) state. Such flows feature quasi-periodic magnetic flux eruptions, power jet-like magnetic tower outflows, and consequently alter the predominant contribution to angular momentum transfer inside the circumbinary disk. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the properties of these flows around equal-mass binary systems on circular orbits ultilizing massively parallel three-dimensional Newtonian magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We investigate the impact of the equation of state and of dynamical cooling, as well as that of the (large-scale) magnetic field topology. Our findings are as follows: (1) A magnetically arrested accretion flow through the cavity can generally be achieved, so long as the initial seed field is strong enough. (2) The cavity, and magnetic flux tube properties and their subsequent propagation are subject to the choice of equation of state/cooling physics. (3) We find tentative evidence that in some regimes the BMAD state, particularly during a flux eruption cycle, can aid shrinking of the binary's orbit. The regimes we explore have implications for multi-messenger transients to stars, supermassive and stellar black hole binaries and their orbital evolution in gaseous environments.",
Cross submissions,Thermal nature of the causal diamond horizon: A hidden property of the inertial propagator,"Nada Eissa,Carlos R. Ordóñez,Gustavo Valdivia-Mera",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Inspired by the novel idea proposed by T.~Padmanabhan in Phys. Rev. D 100, 045024 (2019), we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of the inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent manner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on future-directed propagation. In this method, the Fourier transform is implemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons can be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined to a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past horizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Furthermore, we find that the ratio of emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic Boltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to the right Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T = a/(2\pi)$. We then extend the analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\alpha$, performing a meticulous analysis of the near-horizon geometry and thereby obtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski vacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\alpha$. Our results demonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure, independently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding intrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.",
Cross submissions,Disformal interactions in the Dark Sector: From driving Early Dark Energy to confronting cosmological tensions,"Pulkit Bansal(IIT Bombay),Joseph P. Johnson(IISER Mohali),S. Shankaranarayanan(IIT Bombay)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The $\Lambda$CDM model faces significant challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the dark sector and persistent tensions in the Hubble constant and the clustering amplitude. To address these issues, we propose a general disformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a field-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions including conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early Dark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble friction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological constant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and eventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark energy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on finely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a consequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter, offering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions. This framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature spectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for the observed low-$\ell$ anomaly. By deriving these effects from a fundamental action, our work provides a unified, testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that can be constrained by next-generation cosmological surveys and gravitational wave observations.",
Cross submissions,Topological cones and positively polarizable hyperbolic norms,"Ethan Kharitonov,Argam Ohanyan",Metric Geometry (math.MG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Functional Analysis (math.FA); General Topology (math.GN),"In the first part of this article, we study linear cones over totally ordered fields. We show that for each such cone there uniquely exists a universal vector space (called its spanned vector space) into which it embeds as a generating convex cone. Moreover, we investigate topologies on cones for which the natural cone operations are continuous, and study how these topologies carry over to the spanned vector space. In the second part, we deal with hyperbolic norms which satisfy a polarization identity and are defined on cones over the real numbers. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, such hyperbolic norms induce a Lorentzian inner product on the spanned vector space. Finally, we establish a link between completeness under the Wick rotation of a Lorentzian inner product and order-theoretic completeness.",

Particle production is computed for scenarios that include accelerated motion, black hole evaporation, and beta decay, validating against known results while also extending them. We focus primarily on the low-entropy limit (analogous to non-relativistic motion), but also examine cases of significant particle production arising from harmonic cycles. The results establish an explicit operational link between information flow and matter creation, providing a concrete demonstration of 'it from bit'.",
Cross submissions,Thermal Correlators and Black Holes: From Infinity to Singularity,Samuel Valach,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This thesis explores thermal correlation functions in conformal field theories (CFTs) and their connection to black hole geometry within the AdS/CFT correspondence, using a near-boundary expansion as the main tool. Two themes are examined. First, we show that the stress-tensor sector of boundary correlators encodes information about black hole singularities. By resumming contributions from the stress-tensor and its composites, we uncover branch-point singularities in complex time, corresponding to bulk geodesics that cross the horizon, reflect off the singularity, and return to the boundary. We further clarify the role of double-trace operators in restoring analyticity and the KMS condition, and establish a map between bulk geodesics and OPE sectors of the thermal correlator. Second, we study thermal stress-tensor correlators in CFTs with pure gravity duals. Through holographic calculations in Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we identify a robust universal behaviour - near the lightcone the correlators are described by three universal functions. The bulk Lagrangian only affects the arguments of these functions through corrections to the cubic stress-tensor couplings and the thermal stress-tensor one-point function. We relate this behaviour to causality constraints such as the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), showing that ANEC saturation makes the correlator temperature-independent. Overall, our results demonstrate that thermal correlators - especially their stress-tensor sector - serve as sensitive probes of black hole interiors, causality, and universality in holographic CFTs.",
Cross submissions,Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories,Shinji Tsujikawa,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} > -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without introducing theoretical pathologies. In Horndeski theories, however, breaking the shift symmetry allows this transition. We present an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a higher-order derivative term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts while avoiding ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.",
Cross submissions,Quantum-Corrected $ϕ^{4}$ Inflation in Light of ACT Observations,"Jureeporn Yuennan,Peeravit Koad,Farruh Atamurotov,Phongpichit Channuie",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with Planck and DESI data, suggest a scalar spectral index $n_s$ higher than the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby placing conventional attractor-type inflationary models such as Starobinsky $R^2$ and Higgs inflation under increasing tension at the $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ level. In this work, we examine quantum-corrected $\phi^4$ inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Introducing an anomalous scaling parameter $\gamma$ to capture quantum corrections to the effective potential, we derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$. Confronting these predictions with ACT, Planck, and BAO+lensing constraints, we demonstrate that modest values of $\gamma$ can raise $n_s$ into the ACT-preferred range while maintaining a strongly suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio. For instance, with $N=60$ and $\gamma\simeq 0.006$, the model predicts $n_s\simeq 0.974$ and $r\simeq 0.007$, in excellent agreement with current bounds. We further investigate preheating dynamics, focusing on particle production via parametric resonance in quantum-corrected $\phi^4$ inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In this scenario, the inflaton $\phi$ couples to an additional scalar $\chi$ through an interaction $g^{2}\phi^{2}\chi^{2}$. In Minkowski spacetime, the resonance dynamics reduce to the Mathieu equation, and we find that broad resonance can be readily achieved, leading to efficient particle production.",
Cross submissions,Phantom BTZ Black Holes: Thermal Properties Under Perturbative Corrections,"Kumar Sambhav Upadhyay,Sudhaker Upadhyay,Bhabani Prasad Mandal",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"This study investigates the thermodynamics of phantom BTZ black holes by incorporating leading-order perturbative corrections arising from small statistical fluctuations around equilibrium. Starting from the phantom BTZ black holes review, we describe a modified action in three-dimensional spacetime that includes coupling with a Maxwell or phantom field. The analysis derives the corresponding field equations and obtains exact solutions for the metric and thermodynamic quantities. The corrected entropy is computed using the steepest descent method. It is expressed in terms of the leading-order entropy and Hawking temperature. Standard thermodynamic relations yield the corrected mass, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, and Gibbs free energy. These corrections reveal significant deviations from classical results, particularly in the small black hole regime where statistical effects become prominent. Graphical analysis shows that the corrected entropy becomes negative for sufficiently small black holes, indicating potential limitations in thermodynamic stability under perturbative corrections. Furthermore, the influence of thermal fluctuations proves substantial for the small black holes and negligible for larger black holes. In this work, we have also calculated critical points and critical compressibility factor ($Z_{c}$) of the phantom BTZ black hole, treating it as a Van der Waals fluid. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how statistical fluctuations modify the thermodynamics of phantom BTZ black holes. It underscores the necessity of including such corrections in realistic models of black hole thermodynamics in $(2+1)$ dimensions.",

To date, nearly 6000 exoplanets have been confirmed, yet most of them reside either in the solar neighbourhood or along the sightline toward the Galactic bulge, reflecting the range limits of traditional electromagnetic techniques. In this work, we follow the method proposed inthis http URL&this http URL(2019) to investigate frequency modulations in GW signals from early-stage binary neutron stars (BNSs) induced by circumbinary planets (CBPs) and obtain that CBPs can be detected by the future space-borne detector DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO). For BNS system with the masses of two components both being 1.4 $M_{\odot}$, DECIGO could detect CBPs with mass being dozens of times that of Jupiter out to distances of $\sim 1$ Gpc, well beyond the Local Supercluster, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution for the post main-sequence stage.",

Closely connected with this is the real-time aspect associated with gravitational-wave interferometers and the astrophysical observations they perform; the discovery potential of these instruments can be significantly enhanced when data processing can be achieved in O(1s) timescales. In this work, we introduce a novel signal and noise identification tool based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. For its application into gravitational waves, we will refer to it as GW-YOLO. This tool can provide scene identification capabilities and essential information regarding whether an observed transient is any combination of noise and signal. Additionally, it supplies detailed time-frequency coordinates of the detected objects in the form of pixel masks, an essential property that can be used to understand and characterize astrophysical sources, as well as instrumental noise. The simultaneous identification of noise and signal, combined with precise pixel-level localization, represents a significant advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis. Our approach yields a 50\% detection efficiency for binary black hole signals at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15 when such signals overlap with transient noise artifacts. When noise artifacts overlap with binary neutron star signals, our algorithm attains 50\% detection efficiency at an SNR of 30. This presents the first quantitative assessment of the ability to detect astrophysical events overlapping with realistic, instrument noise present in gravitational-wave interferometers.",

Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.",

By extending our previous Schwarzschild-Dehnen solution using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct a Kerr-like axisymmetric spacetime that smoothly incorporates both black hole rotation and the influence of the surrounding dark matter halo. We systematically investigate the effects of the halo parameters-the central density and halo radius-on horizon structure, the shape and extent of the ergoregion, and the null geodesics associated with black hole shadows. Our results show that the presence of a dense or extended halo expands the event horizon and ergoregion, and significantly alters the size and distortion of the black hole shadow. Furthermore, by applying the WKB approximation to scalar field perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and demonstrate that the frequencies and damping times of ringdown signals are highly sensitive to the halo profile. These results open promising avenues for probing the dark matter environment of astrophysical black holes through black hole imaging and gravitational wave observations.",
Cross submissions,GWTC-4.0: Population Properties of Merging Compact Binaries,"TheLIGO Scientific Collaboration, theVirgo Collaboration, theKAGRA Collaboration",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We detail the population properties of merging compact objects using 158 mergers from the cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0, which includes three types of binary mergers: binary neutron star, neutron star--black hole binary, and binary black hole mergers. We resolve multiple over- and under-densities in the black hole mass distribution: features persist at primary masses of $10\,M_\odot$ and $35\,M_\odot$ with a possible third feature at $\sim 20\,M_\odot$. These are departures from an otherwise power-law-like continuum that steepens above $35\,M_\odot$. Binary black holes with primary masses near $10\,M_\odot$ are more likely to have less massive secondaries, with a mass ratio distribution peaking at $q = 0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$, potentially a signature of stable mass transfer during binary evolution. Black hole spins are inferred to be non-extremal, with 90\% of black holes having $\chi < 0.57$, and preferentially aligned with binary orbits, implying many merging binaries form in isolation. However, we find a significant fraction, 0.24--0.42, of binaries have negative effective inspiral spins, suggesting many could be formed dynamically in gas-free environments. We find evidence for correlation between effective inspiral spin and mass ratio, though it is unclear if this is driven by variation in the mode of the distribution or the width. (Abridged)",
