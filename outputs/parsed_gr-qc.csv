New submissions,Dancing in the dark: probing Dark Matter through the dynamics of eccentric binary pulsars,"Giorgio Nicolini,Andrea Maselli,Miguel Zilhão",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We investigate the dynamics of eccentric binary pulsars embedded in dark matter environments. While previous studies have primarily focused on circular orbits in collisionless dark matter halos, we extend this framework to eccentric systems and explore their interaction with ultralight scalar fields. Adopting a perturbative approach, we compute the modifications to the orbital period induced by dark matter-driven dynamical friction. Our results show that orbital eccentricity amplifies the imprints of non-vacuum environments on binary dynamics, underscoring the potential of such systems as sensitive probes for dark matter signatures.",
New submissions,Effects of quantum geometry on the decoherence induced by black holes,"Max Joseph Fahn,Alessandro Pesci",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Recently, it has been shown that a quantum system held in spatial superposition and then eventually recombined does experience decoherence from black hole horizons, at a level increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. In this, the effects of the horizon have been derived using a classical spacetime picture for the latter. In the present note we point out that quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the quantum black hole could significantly affect the results. In a specific effective implementation of the quantum geometry in terms of a minimal length and ensuing minimal area, it appears in particular that, for selected values of the quantum of area proposed on various grounds in the literature, the decoherence induced by the horizon turns out to be limited to negligibly small values.",
New submissions,Generalised Harrison transformations and black diholes in Einstein-ModMax,"Ana Bokulić,Carlos A. R. Herdeiro",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Einstein-Maxwell theory has powerful solution generating techniques which include Harrison transformations in the Ernst formalism. We construct generalized Harrison transformations that preserve the purely magnetic or purely electric sector in Einstein-ModMax (EMM) theory. Thus, they serve as solution generating techniques within these sectors for this model of non-linear electrodynamics minimally coupled to gravity. As an application we rederive several known exact solutions of EMM and a new solution, black diholes, describing two extremal BHs in equilibrium, with opposite magnetic charges, whose attraction is balanced by their embedding in the Melvin magnetic universe of this model. As a further generalization, we consider Einstein-dilaton-ModMax theory, and provide the extremal charged BHs and black diholes also in this model.",
New submissions,A Quantum Superposition of Black Hole Evaporation Histories: Recovering Unitarity,"Ali Akil,Lorenzo Giannelli,Leonardo Modesto,Oscar Dahlsten,Giulio Chiribella,Caslav Brukner",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Black hole evaporation is one of the most striking phenomena at the interface between gravity and quantum physics. In Hawking's semi-classical treatment, where matter is quantum mechanical and the spacetime is definite and classical, evaporation leads to an apparent loss of unitarity of the overall evolution, and to the so-called black hole information paradox. Here, we go beyond this semi-classical treatment and formulate a toy quantum model of black hole evaporation that allows the black hole to evolve into a superposition of being fully evaporated and not fully evaporated, consistent with the Hawking particles being in a coherent superposition of different energy levels. We model Hawking particle production by the repeated action of quantum-controlled unitaries, generating emission from the quantum black hole and accounting for a quantum coherent back-reaction on the black hole matter state. We show that the probability of full annihilation of the black hole matter increases with time until the black hole is, asymptotically, fully evaporated in every branch of the quantum superposition. We prove that under natural assumptions, this evaporation model is unitary, such that the initial state can in principle be recovered from the final asymptotic state of the radiation.",
New submissions,On the stability of exceptional Brans-Dicke wormholes,"Kirill A. Bronnikov,Sergei V. Bolokhov,Milena V. Skvortsova,Rustam Ibadov,Feruza Y. Shaymanova",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In our previous papers we have analyzed the stability of vacuum and electrovacuum static, spherically symmetric space-times in the framework of the Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt class of scalar-tensor theories (STT) of gravity. In the present paper, we continue this study by examining the stability of exceptional solutions of the Brans-Dicke theory with the coupling constant $\omega =0$ that were not covered in the previous studies. Such solutions describe neutral or charged wormholes and involve a conformal continuation: the standard conformal transformation maps the whole Einstein-frame manifold ${\mathbb M}_E$ to only a part of the Jordan-frame manifold ${\mathbb M}_J$, which has to be continued beyond the emerging regular boundary S, and the new region maps to another manifold ${\mathbb M}_{E-}$. The metric in ${\mathbb M}_J$ is symmetric with respect to S only if the charge $q$ is zero. Our stability study concerns radial (monopole) perturbations, and it is shown that the wormhole is stable if $q \ne 0$ and unstable only in the symmetric case $q=0$",
New submissions,Two scalarizations of magnetically charged black holes,Yun Soo Myung,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study two scalarizations of magnetically charged black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) term. For this purpose, two scalar coupling functions $f_1(\phi)$ and $f_2(\phi)$ are introduced to couple to Gauss-Bonnet (GB) and NED terms. The bald black hole is described by mass ($M$) and action parameter ($\alpha$) with magnetic charge ($P$), which becomes the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole for $P=M$ whose action is still unknown. We derive Smarr formula which describes a correct thermodynamics for the charged black hole. Two Davies points of heat capacity are not identified with two critical onset mass and action parameter for GB$^-$ scalarization with $f_1(\phi)$. Furthermore, the shadow radius analysis of charged black hole is performed to include naked singularities and it is compared to the EHT observation. There is no constraints on the action parameter, whereas new mass constraints are found. Finally, the NED$^+$ spontaneous scalarization with $f_2(\phi)$ leads to infinite branches of scalarized charged black holes.",
New submissions,Connecting Early Dark Energy to Late Dark Energy by the Diluting Matter Potential,"Eduardo I. Guendelman,Ramon Herrera,Pedro Labrana",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work we study a scale invariant gravity theory containing two scalar fields, dust particles and a measure defined from degrees of freedom independent of the metric. The integration of the degrees of freedom that define the measure spontaneously break the scale symmetry, leaving us in the Einstein frame with an effective potential that is dependent on the density of the particles. The potential contains three flat regions, one for inflation, another for early dark energy and the third for late dark energy. At a certain point, as the matter dilutes, tunneling from the early dark energy to the late dark energy can start efficiently. This mechanism naturally alleviated the observed Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon prior to recombination while preserving late-time cosmology. Moreover, the model predictions are consistent with observations from the reduced CMB, BAO, and local measurement of $H_0$, providing a coherent and unified description of the universe. In this context, the Bayesian analysis of these datasets confirms the viability of our scenario, with the best-fit parameters indicating an early dark energy fraction of approximately 30$\%$ at a redshift of $z'=5000$.",
New submissions,Generic EFT-motivated beyond General Relativity gravitational wave tests and their curvature dependence: from observation to interpretation,"Laura Bernard,Suvendu Giri,Luis Lehner,Riccardo Sturani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a ""dictionary"" to expedite the identification of potential deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular, facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.",
New submissions,Optical images of the Kerr-Sen black hole and thin accretion disk,"Pei Wang,Sen Guo,Li-Fang Li,Zhan-Feng Mai,Bo-Feng Wu,Wen-Hao Deng,Qing-Quan Jiang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper investigates the observable properties of a Kerr-Sen black hole surrounded by a thin accretion disk, focusing on the impact of the black hole's spin and charge on the image. Using ray-tracing techniques, we conduct a detailed analysis of the black hole's image, redshift distribution, and intensity distributions at different observation frequencies. The results demonstrate that spin has a more significant effect on the distortion of the inner shadow than charge, and the observer's inclination angle plays a critical role in shaping the redshift distribution, especially near the innermost stable circular orbit. Additionally, the intensity is found to be higher at 86 GHz than at 230 GHz. This study highlights the crucial role of the accretion disk's geometry in determining the black hole's image and redshift effects, thereby providing a refined theoretical framework to guide future observational efforts targeting the Kerr-Sen black hole and its electromagnetic signals.",
New submissions,Gravitational lensing and shadow around a non-minimally coupled Horndeski black hole in plasma medium,"Shubham Kala,Jaswinder Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the light deflection and the shadow characteristics of a non-minimally coupled Horndeski black hole surrounded by a magnetized, cold, pressureless plasma medium, while considering both homogeneous and non-homogeneous plasma distributions. We consider an analytical expression for the deflection angle of light and analyze how it is influenced by the plasma properties and the Horndeski coupling constant. The circular light orbits, which define the photon sphere, are also analyzed for both types of plasma media, highlighting their impact on the shadow boundary. The shadow properties of the black hole are examined in detail, and constraints on the model parameters are derived by comparing the theoretical shadow radius with observational measurements of Sgr A* and M87* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. We also study the black hole shadow images along with the corresponding intensity profiles produced by a radially infalling accretion flow in the plasma environment. The results are particularly interesting, as they reveal how the modified black hole geometry affects both the plasma distribution and the black hole parameters in a realistic astrophysical context.",
New submissions,Greybody factors in Horndeski gravity and beyond,"Georgios Antoniou,Thomas D. Pappas,Panagiota Kanti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the framework of the beyond Horndeski action, we consider three sub-theories, that support scalarised black-hole solutions, and look for modified characteristics compared to GR. We first study the propagation of massless scalar and vector test fields in the fixed background of an analytical spherically-symmetric black hole derived in the context of a parity-symmetric beyond Horndeski theory, and show that the profiles of the effective gravitational potentials, greybody factors, absorption cross-sections and quasinormal frequencies exhibit distinct modifications as we move away from the GR limit. We then turn our attention to the perturbations of the gravitational field itself and adopt a full-theory analysis that takes into account the backreaction of the scalar field on the metric. Employing as background solutions scalarised black holes arising in the shift-symmetric Horndeski theory and in the Quadratic-Quartic-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, we compute the greybody factors and QNMs of the axial sector. In both theories, in direct correspondence to the form of the gravitational potential which features multiple extremal points, we find modified (suppressed or non-monotonic) greybody curves and altered quasinormal frequencies (smaller oscillating frequencies and larger damping times), especially as the hair-sourcing parameter increases.",
New submissions,Some features of the extended phase space approach to quantization of gravity,T. P. Shestakova,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, I emphasize those features of the extended phase space approach to quantization of gravity that distinguish it among other approaches. First of all, it is the conjecture about non-trivial topology of the Universe which was supported by Wheeler, Hawking and other founders of quantum gravity. However, this conjecture appears to be in contradiction with the assumption about asymptotic states that is used in the path integral quantization of gauge theories. The presence of asymptotic states ensures gauge invariance of the theory, but, in the case of gravity, the states exist only in asymptotically flat spacetimes, that limits possible topologies. Then we have two ways. The first way is to consider only asymptotically flat spacetimes. In fact, it reduces quantum gravity to quantum field theory on a given background. The second way is to reject the assumption about asymptotic states. In the case of non-trivial topology, one cannot cover the whole spacetime with the only coordinate system. One has to introduce various reference frames fixed by different gauge conditions in different spacetime regions. The Hamiltonian describing a gravitating system will depend on gauge conditions. It leads to the conclusion that unitary evolution may be broken down. This conclusion cannot be obtained in approaches based on the Wheeler - DeWitt equation or making use of the assumption about asymptotic states. The assessment of this conclusion is given.",
New submissions,Mass-Gap Neutron Stars from Vector \texorpdfstring{$f(R)$}{f(R)} Gravity Inflationary Deformations,V.K. Oikonomou,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The latest observations from the LIGO-Virgo indicated the existence of mass-gap region astrophysical objects. This is a rather sensational observation and there are two possibilities for the nature of these mass-gap region astrophysical objects, these are either small black holes that result from the mergers of ordinary mass neutron stars, or these are heavy neutron stars. In the line of research implied by the former possibility, in this work we shall examine the implied neutron star phenomenology from vector $f(R)$ gravity inflationary models. These theories are basically scalar-tensor deformations of the Starobinsky inflationary model. We shall present the essential features of cosmologically viable and non-viable deformations of the Starobinsky model, originating from vector $f(R)$ gravity inflationary theories, and we indicate which models and for which equations of state provide a viable neutron star phenomenology. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations using a robust double shooting LSODA python based code, for the following piecewise polytropic equations of state the WFF1, the SLy, the APR, the MS1, the AP3, the AP4, the ENG, the MPA1 and the MS1b. We confront the resulting phenomenology with several well known neutron star constraints and we indicate which equation of state and model fits the phenomenological constraints. A remarkable feature, also known from other inflationary attractor models, is that the MPA1 is the equation of state which is most nicely fitted the constraints, for all the theoretical models used, and actually the maximum mass for this equation of state is well inside the mass-gap region. Another mentionable feature that stroked us with surprise is the fact that even cosmologically non-viable inflationary models produced a viable neutron star phenomenology, which most likely has to be a model-dependent feature.",
New submissions,A Non-Commutative Kalb-Ramond Black Hole,"A. A. Araújo Filho,N. Heidari,Iarley P. Lobo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This work presents a new black hole solution within the framework of a non-commutative gauge theory applied to Kalb-Ramond gravity. Using the method recently proposed in the literature [Nucl.Phys.B 1017 (2025) 116950], we employ the Moyal twist $\partial_r \wedge \partial_\theta$ to implement non-commutativity, being encoded by parameter $\Theta$. We begin by verifying that the resulting black hole no longer possesses spherical symmetry, while the event horizon remains unaffected by non-commutative corrections. The Kretschmann scalar is computed to assess the corresponding regularity. It turns out that the solution is regular, provided that the Christoffel symbols and related quantities are not expanded to second order in $\Theta$. We derive the thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature $T^{(\Theta,\ell)}$, entropy $S^{(\Theta,\ell)}$, and heat capacity $C_V^{(\Theta,\ell)}$. The remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$ is estimated by imposing $T^{(\Theta,\ell)} \to 0$, although the absence of a physical remnant indicates complete evaporation. Quantum radiation for bosons and fermions is analyzed via the tunneling method, where divergent integrals are treated using the residue theorem. Notably, in the low-frequency regime, the particle number density for bosons surpasses that of fermions (at least within the scope of the methods considered here). The effective potential for a massless scalar field is obtained perturbatively, enabling the computation of quasinormal modes and the time-domain profiles. Finally, further bounds on $\Theta$ and $\ell$ (Lorentz-violating paramter) are derived from solar system tests, including the perihelion precession of Mercury, light deflection, and the Shapiro time delay.",
New submissions,Bispectrum of induced gravitational waves in the poltergeist mechanism,"Han-Wen Hu,Cheng-Jun Fang,Zhen-Min Zeng,Zong-Kuan Guo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In the poltergeist mechanism the enhancement of induced gravitational waves (GWs) occurs due to a sudden transition from an early matter-dominated era to the radiation-dominated era. In this work, we calculate the bispectrum of induced GWs from the poltergeist mechanism by adopting the sudden transition approximation. We find that the tensor bispectrum peaks either in the equilateral or squeezed configurations, depending on scales. Such a characteristic behavior enables us to distinguish it from that from other GW generation mechanisms.",
New submissions,The Nonlinear Tails in Black Hole Ringdown: the Scattering Perspective,"A. Ianniccari,L. Lo Bianco,A. Riotto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Black holes regain their static configuration by emitting ringdown gravitational waves, whose amplitude decays in time following a power law at fixed spatial positions. We show that the nonlinear decay power law may be obtained by simple scattering calculations using the in-in formalism and argue that the nonperturbative law should be $t^{-2\ell-1}$, where $\ell$ is the multipole of the propagating spherical gravitational wave.",
Cross submissions,Holographic QCD Matter: Chiral Soliton Lattices in Strong Magnetic Field,"Markus A.G. Amano,Minoru Eto,Muneto Nitta,Shin Sasaki",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) in the framework of holographic QCD in magnetic field. Under appropriate boundary conditions for the gauge field and the quark mass deformation, we demonstrate that the ground state in the gravitational dual of QCD is given by the CSL in the background magnetic field and the baryon number density. In the presence of the background magnetic field, we show that the CSL is interpreted as a uniformly distributed D4-branes in the holographic setup, where the chiral soliton is identified with a non-self-dual instanton vortex or a center vortex in the five dimensional bulk gauge theory. While the baryon numbers are given to chiral solitons as well as Skyrmions due to the different terms in the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term in the chiral perturbation theory, these baryon numbers with different origins are unified in terms of the instanton charge density in five dimensions. With bulk analysis of the WZW term, we find that the pion decay constant becomes dependent on the magnetic field. For the massless pion case, we obtain an analytical form that is in qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results for strong magnetic fields.",
Cross submissions,Strong scale-dependence does not enhance the kinematic boosting of gravitational wave backgrounds,"Giorgio Mentasti,Carlo R. Contaldi,Marco Peloso",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Existing expressions in the literature appear to indicate that Doppler boosting, due to our proper motion with respect to the isotropic frame of the universe, can amplify stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds whose energy spectra exhibit strong scale dependence, for example, those generated by large scalar perturbations in models of primordial black holes or by astrophysical populations with broken power-law behaviour. It has been suggested that this enhancement could increase the signal-to-noise ratio of such backgrounds in pulsar timing measurements, as well as in ground- and space-based observatories. We show that the reported enhancement is an artefact of a Taylor expansion of the boosted signal, typically performed in the literature under the assumption of a small boosting parameter. This approximation fails to reproduce the correct result for signals with strong scale dependence. When Doppler boosting is treated exactly, the apparent amplification disappears. Using representative spectra, we demonstrate that Doppler motion induces only blue- and red-shifting by the expected amount; it does not lead to additional amplification or introduce new spectral features. The exact expression for the kinematic boost can and should be easily applied in analysing such backgrounds.",
Cross submissions,Convection signatures in early-time gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae,"Marco Cusinato,Martin Obergaulinger,Miguel-Ángel Aloy",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves emitted from core-collapse supernova explosions are critical observables for extracting information about the dynamics and properties of both the progenitor and the post-bounce~evolution of the system. They are prime targets for current interferometric searches and represent a key milestone for the capabilities of next-generation interferometers.This study aims to characterize how the gravitational waveform associated with prompt stellar convection depends on the rotational rate and magnetic field topology of the progenitor star.We carry out a series of axisymmetric simulations of a $16.5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ red supergiant with five configurations of initial magnetic fields and varying degrees of initial rotation. We then analyze the contribution of early-time convection and the proto-neutron star core to the waveform using ensemble empirical mode decomposition, alongside spectral and Fourier analyses, to facilitate comparison and interpretation of the results.Our simulations reveal that early post-bounce gravitational waves signals are dominated by the first six intrinsic mode functions, with variations due to rotation and magnetic fields influencing the signal strength. Strong magnetic fields decelerate core rotation, affecting mode excitation. Regardless of the initial rotation, convection consistently drives a low-frequency mode that lasts throughout the evolution. Additionally, our results show that the bounce signal is not consistently the strongest component of the waveform. Instead, we find that prompt convection generates a post-bounce signal of comparable or even greater amplitude.",
Cross submissions,"A unified spin-harmonic framework for correlating pulsar timing, astrometric deflection, and shimmering gravitational wave observations","Giorgio Mentasti,Carlo R. Contaldi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a unified spin-weighted harmonic framework that delivers analytic, diagonal expressions for the overlap (correlation) functions of three low frequency gravitational wave observables-pulsar timing redshifts, astrometric deflections, and time-dependent image distortions (``shimmering''). Writing each response in spin-$s$ spherical harmonics and rotating to a basis in which the wave tensor has definite helicity, we obtain compact closed-form series for every auto- and cross-correlation, recovering the Hellings-Downs curve as the $s=0$ limit and deriving its astrometric ($s=\pm 1$) and shimmering ($s=\pm 2$) analogues. The formalism naturally extends to non-standard scalar-breathing, longitudinal, and vector polarisation modes, clarifying when higher-spin observables are (and are not) sourced and providing a complete set of harmonic spectra $C_\ell$ ready for parameter estimation pipelines. These results supply the common theoretical language needed to combine upcoming pulsar timing, Gaia-class astrometric, and high resolution imaging data sets, enabling coherent, multi probe searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, tests of general relativity and its alternatives across the nano- to micro-hertz gravitational wave band.",
Cross submissions,Monodromic Dark Energy and DESI,"Samuel Goldstein,Marco Celoria,Fabian Schmidt",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed interest in dynamical dark energy models, particularly those that cross the ""phantom divide"" ($w_{\rm DE} = -1$). We present the first observational constraints on monodromic k-essence, a physically motivated scalar field dark energy scenario capable of realizing rapid oscillations about the phantom divide. Using cosmic microwave background (CMB) information, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and Type Ia supernovae observations, we constrain the amplitude, frequency, phase, and power-law index describing the monodromic k-essence scenario at the background level. We find that the monodromic dark energy scenario can fit these datasets with a $\chi^2$ that is comparable to the phenomenological $w_0$-$w_a$ parametrization. While the CMB and BAO data alone are consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the inclusion of DESY5 supernovae shows a preference for a non-zero amplitude, $A=0.44^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ (fully marginalized 68% C.L.). Conversely, inclusion of the Pantheon-Plus supernovae provides no evidence for monodromic k-essence, with $A<0.43$ (95% C.L.). We show that constraints on both monodromic dark energy and $w_0$-$w_a$ models are sensitive to the DESI DR2 LRG2 BAO distance, especially in the absence of supernovae data.",
Cross submissions,Super-Enhanced Absorption of Gravitons in Atomic Gases,Yongle Yu,Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a novel method for detecting gravitons using an atomic gas supported by laser fields. Despite the coupling strength of gravitons to atomic transitions being orders of magnitude weaker than that of photons to atomic transitions, the rate of graviton-absorbed atomic transitions can be substantially elevated to a practically observable level. This enhancement is facilitated by an exceptionally potent amplification effect, stemming from a collective quantum electrodynamics phenomenon that encompasses a simultaneous multiphoton-multiatom process.",
Cross submissions,Tightening constraints on primordial oscillations with latest ACT and SPT data,"Ze-Yu Peng,Yun-Song Piao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The oscillation in primordial power spectrum (PPS), a fingerprint of not only a wide class of models of inflation but new physics, is of significant theoretical interest, and can be imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we present constraints on periodic oscillations in the PPS using the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1 CMB data with the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. It is found that the combination of SPT and ACT with Planck CMB dataset significantly tightens the upper bound to $A_\mathrm{log,lin}\lesssim 0.029$ at 95\% C.L., showing no hint for primordial oscillations, where $A_\mathrm{log,lin}$ are the amplitudes of logarithmic and linear oscillation in the PPS, respectively. Our work presents state-of-the-art CMB constraints on primordial oscillations, highlighting the power of the ground-based CMB experiments in constraining physics beyond the simplest slow-roll models.",
Cross submissions,Scattering Hawking Radiation,Peng Cheng,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze the physical consequences of scattering Hawking radiation emitted in the vicinity of the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The Hawking radiation from the horizon becomes soft at a large distance away from the horizon due to the gravitational redshift, and the above process is exactly the soft theorem in curved spacetime. For an observer located at infinity, such a scattering process introduces a large gauge transformation, which can be regarded as a memory effect. The large gauge transformation is expected to encode more information about the radiation and might shed light on the black hole information paradox.",
Cross submissions,Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $γ$-ray bursts,"Lu Feng,Tao Han,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} > 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.",
Cross submissions,GW231123: a product of successive mergers from $\sim 10 $ stellar-mass black holes,"Yin-Jie Li,Shan-Peng Tang,Ling-Qin Xue,Yi-Zhong Fan",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We analyze GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH mass and spin distributions to test possible formation scenarios: first-generation stellar collapse, hierarchical (multi-generation) mergers, and primordial origin. Our analysis strongly prefers scenarios where at least one component is a higher-generation BH. Both components are favored to have high spins, which rules out scenarios in which they are both first-generation (low spin) or primordial (nearly non-spin). We conclude that GW231123 is a hierarchical merger, with components plausibly originate from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical fraction in the disks of active galactic nucleus.",
Cross submissions,Celestial Holography meets dS/CFT,"Hideo Furugori,Naoki Ogawa,Sotaro Sugishita,Takahiro Waki",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We provide a concrete link between celestial amplitudes and cosmological correlators. We first construct a map from quantum field theories (QFTs) in $(D+2)$-dimensional Euclidean space to theories on the $(D+1)$-dimensional sphere, through a Weyl rescaling and a Fourier transformation. An analytic continuation extends this map to a relation between QFTs in Minkowski spacetime $\text{M}_{D+2}$ and in de Sitter spacetime $\text{dS}_{D+1}$ with the Bunch-Davies vacuum. Combining this relation with celestial holography, we show that the extrapolated operators in de Sitter space can be represented by operators on the celestial sphere $S^{D}$. Our framework offers a systematic route to transfer computational techniques and physical insights between celestial holography and the dS/CFT correspondence.",
Cross submissions,The canonical generalised Levi-Civita connection and its curvature,"Vicente Cortés,Matas Mackevicius,Thomas Mohaupt,Oskar Schiller",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Given a (semi-Riemannian) generalised metric $\mathcal G$ and a divergence operator $\mathrm{div}$ on an exact Courant algebroid $E$, we geometrically construct a canonical generalised Levi-Civita connection $D^{\mathcal G, \mathrm{div}}$ for these data. In this way we provide a resolution of the problem of non-uniqueness of generalised Levi-Civita connections. Since the generalised Riemann tensor of $D^{\mathcal G, \mathrm{div}}$ is an invariant of the pair $(\mathcal G, \mathrm{div})$, we no longer need to discard curvature components which depend on the choice of the generalised connection. As a main result we decompose the generalised Riemann curvature tensor of $D^{\mathcal G, \mathrm{div}}$ in terms of classical (non-generalised) geometric data. Based on this set of master formulas we derive a comprehensive curvature tool-kit for applications in generalised geometry. This includes decompositions for the full generalised Ricci tensor, the generalised Ricci tensor, and three generalised scalar-valued curvature invariants, two of which are new.",
Cross submissions,Inflation from a generalized exponential plateau: towards extra suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratios,"Gerasimos Kouniatalis,Emmanuel N. Saridakis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a standard minimally-coupled scalar-field inflationary scenario, which is based on a new potential, with suitably generalized plateau features, that leads to extra small tensor-to-scalar ratios. In particular, we consider a specific three-parameter potential, which has a flatter plateau and a steeper well compared to the Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame. We study the inflationary realization and we show that it guarantees a prolonged period of slow-roll inflation and a successful exit. Additionally, the steeper minimum leads to significantly suppressed tensor perturbations, and thus to an extra-small tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and we show that we are able to obtain $r$ values less than $10^{-5}$. Moreover, we calculate the reheating temperature showing that in order to be in agreement with observations one of the potential parameters should remain within specific bounds. Finally, performing an inverse conformal transformation to the Jordan frame we show that the considered potential corresponds to higher-order corrections to Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame, and these corrections are the reason for the improved behavior of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.",
