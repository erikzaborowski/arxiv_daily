New submissions,The Anholonomic Frame and Connection Deformation Method for constructing off-diagonal solutions in (modified) Einstein gravity and nonassociative geometric flows and Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton theories,"Laurenţiu Bubuianu,Julia O. Seti,Douglas Singleton,Sergiu I. Vacaru,Elşen Veli Veliev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This article is a status report on the Anholonomic Frame and Connection Deformation Method, AFCDM, for constructing generic off-diagonal exact and parametric solutions in general relativity, GR, relativistic geometric flows, and modified gravity theories, MGTs. Such models can be generalized to nonassociative and noncommutative star products on phase spaces and modelled equivalently as nonassociative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometries. Our approach involves a nonholonomic geometric reformulation of classical models of gravitational and matter fields described by Lagrange and Hamilton densities on relativistic phase spaces. Using nonholonomic dyadic variables, the Einstein equations in GR and MGTs can be formulated as systems of nonlinear partial differential equations(PDEs), which can be decoupled and integrated in some general off-diagonal forms. In this approach, the Lagrange and Hamilton dynamics and related models of classical and quantum evolution are equivalently described in terms of generalized Finsler-like or canonical metrics and (nonlinear) connection structures on deformed phase spaces defined by solutions of modified Einstein equations. New classes of exact and parametric solutions in (nonassociative) MGTs are formulated in terms of generating and integration functions and generating effective/ matter sources. The physical interpretation of respective classes of solutions depends on the type of (non) linear symmetries, prescribed boundary/ asymptotic conditions, or posed Cauchy problems.",
New submissions,Rotating Isospectral Drums,Anton Lebedev,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Optics (physics.optics),"In this thesis I demonstrate that isospectral domains, that is domains of differing geometric shapes that possess identical spectra, do not remain isospectral when subject to uniform rotation. One thus *can* hear the shape of a rotating drum. It is shown that the spectra diverge as $\propto\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2$ similarly to a square but different from a circle, whose degenerate eigenfrequencies split $\propto \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)$. The latter two cases are studied analytically and used as test cases for the selection of numerical solution methods. I demonstrate that the presence of a simple medium attenuates the effects of rotation on the spectrum differences. Further I show that the common but linearised augmented wave equation yields eigenmodes with sensible structure for non-physical parameters, whereas a full equation destroys the structure as intended. The full equation is obtained from first principles using Maxwell equations formulated as differential forms and a careful application of the 3+1 foliation of space-time. The differences of the result from literaturearXiv:physics/0607016are highlighted and their effects studied. The equation is treated analytically on simple domains to obtain reference data for numerical analysis. Nodal and modal discretisations of the PDE are tested and a self-written FEM implementation is chosen due to higher precision of the results. As part of the validation process I demonstrate that results ofarXiv:physics/0607016are reproducible. The resulting gyroscopic quadratic eigenvalue problem is linearised into a Hamiltonian/skew-Hamiltonian pencil and a suitable shift operator for the Arnoldi iteration is determined. The resulting formulation is solved using ARPACK.",
New submissions,Study of Kiselev Black Hole in Quantum Fluctuation Modified Gravity via Quasinormal modes and Greybody Factors,"W. Sajjad,M. Azam",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we formulate the wave function to compute the effective potential of scalar and vector fields for the Kiselve black hole in the background of quantum fluctuation modified gravity. Using the 6th-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approach, the quasinormal modes for the considered black hole are obtained through scalar and vector perturbation fields. We investigate the quasinormal frequency by considering several values of the metric and equation of state ($\mho$ and $\bar{\bar{\omega}}$) parameter, respectively. The real part values of the quasinormal modes drop as the $\mho$ values rise. Later, the greybody factors of the black hole are determined and found that the parameters $\mho$, $\bar{\bar{\omega}}$ and the multipole moment $l$ significantly affects the greybody factors. Additionally, for scalar perturbations, we graphically analyze the rigorous bound of the greybody factor under the effects of parameters $\mho$ and $l$.",
New submissions,Penetrating the horizon of a hydrodynamic white hole,"Nisha Jangid,Arnab K. Ray",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn),"In a shallow-water radial outflow the horizon of a hydrodynamic white hole coincides with a standing circular hydraulic jump. The jump, caused by viscosity, makes the horizon visible as a circular front, standing as a barrier against the entry of waves within its circumference. The blocking of waves causes a pile-up at the horizon of the white hole, for which surface tension is mainly responsible. Conversely, it is also because of surface tension that the waves can penetrate the barrier. The penetrating waves (analogue Hawking quanta) tunnel through the barrier with a decaying amplitude, but a large-amplitude instability about the horizon is possible.",
New submissions,Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in relativistic accretion discs,"Francisco Duque,Laura Sberna,Andrew Spiers,Rodrigo Vicente",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We compute relativistic Lindblad torques for circular, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded in relativistic thin accretion discs, including spinning black hole configurations. We find that relativistic effects can amplify the magnitude of these torques by orders of magnitude in the strong-field regime, and that the torque can even reverse direction as the EMRI approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). However, we show that the location of this reversal is highly spin-dependent, shifting progressively closer to the ISCO, where gravitational-wave emission completely dominates the inspiral, as the spin of the central black hole increases. Spin also modifies the radial dependence of the Lindblad torques. We investigate whether Lindblad torques can be approximated by parametrised power laws of the form T_LR = A(r_s / 10M)^n_r (or combinations thereof), and find significant spin- and disc-dependent variations in the slope parameter n_r. For instance, for spin a/M = 0.9, we find n_r = 3.6 in the strong-field regime, compared to the Newtonian value of n_r = 4.5. Given current forecasts of parameter recovery for ``golden'', loud EMRIs in accretion discs (\Delta n_r ~ 0.5), we predict LISA could distinguish between different disc configurations through their relativistic Lindblad torque signatures, providing the first direct probe of the midplane structure of the inner region of accretion discs, which is inaccessible to electromagnetic observations.",
New submissions,Singularity resolution in the backreacted Schwarzschild geometry from 2D matter with negative central charge,"F. J. Marañón-González,A. del Río,J. Navarro-Salas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Two-dimensional dilaton gravity provides a valuable framework to study the dynamics of quantum black holes. These models are often coupled to conformal scalar fields, which capture essential quantum effects such as the trace anomaly, while remaining analytically tractable. From the viewpoint of two-dimensional quantum field theory, unitary theories require a positive central charge. However, theories with a total negative central charge naturally arise from the contribution of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts to the effective action. Recent analyses of the Callan-Giddins-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model with a Russo-Susskin-Thorlacius (RST) counterterm have shown that a negative central charge can remove curvature singularities in the backreacted geometry. In this work, we argue that singularity resolution arises from the negative central charge itself, rather than the particular dynamics of a given model. To support this, we present analogous results in spherically reduced Einstein gravity.",
New submissions,Cosmological and Dynamical Aspects of Teleparallel Gravity and its Extension,L K Duchaniya,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This thesis investigates the characteristics of modified teleparallel gravity models that incorporate a scalar field and a trace of the energy-momentum tensor, with particular attention to their cosmological effects, especially regarding late-time cosmic acceleration. Teleparallel gravity, as an alternative framework to General Relativity, defines gravity through torsion rather than curvature, and when combined with a scalar field, it allows exploration of a wider variety of cosmological scenarios. This thesis examines the late-time acceleration of the Universe and its various phases through dynamical system analysis within the framework of modified teleparallel gravity theories. It presents the mathematical formulations of $f(T)$, $f(T, \mathcal{T})$, $f(T, \phi)$, Horndeski teleparallel gravity, and the quintessence dark energy model, along with the application of dynamical systems and relevant cosmological datasets. Overall, the results demonstrate that these modified teleparallel gravity models provide viable descriptions of the late-time cosmic acceleration and offer insights into the dynamics of the Universe beyond standard cosmology.",
New submissions,A Conceptual Introduction To Signature Change Through a Natural Extension of Kaluza-Klein Theory,"Vincent Moncrief,Nathalie E. Rieger",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We propose an extension of basic Kaluza-Klein theory in which the higher-dimensional Lorentzian manifold develops a Cauchy horizon rather than remaining globally hyperbolic as in the conventional framework. In this setting, the $U(1)$-generating Killing field, assumed to exist in Kaluza-Klein theory, undergoes a transition in its causal character, from spacelike in the globally hyperbolic region to timelike in an acausal extension through a horizon. This yields a (lower-dimensional) quotient manifold whose metric changes signature from Lorentzian to Riemannian. In this way, one observes a singular, signature changing transition emerging rather naturally from the projection of a globally smooth, even analytic, Lorentzian geometry ""up in the bundle"". This reveals a ""signature change without signature change"" scenario - a phrasing inspired by John Wheeler - and extends the usual Kaluza-Klein framework in a conceptually natural direction.",
New submissions,Neural Post-Einsteinian Test of General Relativity with the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog,"Yiqi Xie,Gautham Narayan,Nicolás Yunes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries are excellent probes of gravity in the strong- and dynamical-field regime. We report a test of general relativity (GR) with the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using the recently developed neural post-Einsteinian framework, both on individual events and at the population level through hierarchical modeling. We find no significant violation of GR and place a constraint that, for the first time, efficiently covers non-GR theories characterized by not only post-Newtonian deviations but also those beyond under the same theory-agnostic framework.",
New submissions,Dispersion in Analogue Gravity,"Eren Erberk Erkul,Ulf Leonhardt",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Analogue models of gravity, from Newton to Unruh, have evolved from simple fluid--mechanical models to sophisticated modern experiments. They have shown the robustness of Hawking radiation and highlighted the role of dispersion for quantum fields in curved space. We speculate whether some underlying dispersion may also play a role in explaining the cosmological constant and in resolving the cosmological tensions.",
New submissions,Basis-independent coherence and its distribution in de Sitter spacetime,"Samira Elghaayda,Atta ur Rahman,Mostafa Mansour",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Quantum coherence in curved spacetime offers a fresh window into the interplay between gravity, thermality, and quantum resources. While previous work has shown that Markovian evolution can generate entanglement and other nonclassical correlations in de Sitter backgrounds, the basis-dependent nature of coherence has so far limited its unambiguous interpretation. Here, we introduce a basis-independent framework to quantify not only the total coherence of two comoving detectors, but also its collective and localized contributions, and we trace how each of these decomposed measures varies with the inverse of Gibbons-Hawking temperature. By treating the detectors as open quantum systems interacting with a massless scalar field in the Bunch-Davies and squeezed alpha-vacua, we find that non-thermal squeezing substantially enhances extractable coherence, even under strong thermal effects. Our results demonstrate how basis-independent coherence in de Sitter spacetime can serve as a robust resource for relativistic quantum information protocols.",
New submissions,PINNGraPE: Physics Informed Neural Network for Gravitational wave Parameter Estimation,"Leigh Smith,Matteo Scialpi,Francesco di Clemente,Michał Bejger",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Weakly-modelled searches for gravitational waves are essential for ensuring that all potential sources are accounted for in detection efforts, as they make minimal assumptions regarding source morphology. While these searches primarily target generic transient sources, they are also highly effective at identifying a broad range of compact binary coalescences, demonstrated by the weakly-modelled search algorithm coherent WaveBurst being the first to detect GW150914. Despite their ability to detect compact binaries with diverse properties, the accurate estimation of source parameters from their output remains to be a challenging task. To overcome this, we leverage physics-informed neural networks, which serve as a powerful tool for parameter estimation by applying physical constraints through the universal differential equation governing a compact binary system. With this approach, we rapidly infer the mass parameters of binary black hole merger systems to within 7% from only the time-frequency representation of the gravitational wave signal.",
New submissions,3+1 GRHD simulations of NSBH mergers with light black holes using public codes,"S. Gomez Lopez,B. Giacomazzo,F. Pannarale",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent observations of compact binary systems have provided evidence for black holes with masses below standard expectations. When paired with neutron stars (NSs), such low-mass black holes (BHs) have the potential to be detected by future multimessenger campaigns and could unveil unknown features of the BH population in the universe. Given the importance of accurate models for matched-filtering searches and Bayesian parameter estimation in discoveries of this sort, attention has renewed on the limitations of low-mass NSBH merger models and on the downstream impact of such limitations on gravitational-wave data analysis. Previous numerical relativity (NR) studies have revealed discrepancies in the predicted merger time, as well as more general mismatches and dephasing between phenomenological models and high-resolution simulations. The simulation presented here was motivated by these findings and illustrates how publicly available tools can be applied to this specific science case, towards informing next-generation, more refined gravitational-wave and kilonovae models. Here, we summarize the setup of a high-resolution general relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of an equal-mass NSBH system performed entirely with public codes (Einstein Toolkit and FUKA) and a finite-temperature equation of state. The results we show include the $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ strain and 2D snapshots of the system undergoing tidal disruption and early postmerger disk formation. The system evolved for $\sim 4$ orbits while the $L_2$ norm of the Hamiltonian constraint remained below $6\times10^{-7}$ throughout the inspiral prior to growing near merger time.",
New submissions,Scalar-Tensor Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity: Reconstruct the Cosmological History with a Steep Potential,"Ghulam Murtaza,Avik De,Andronikos Paliathanasis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Within the framework of scalar-non-metricity gravity, we introduce a steep potential together with a power-law coupling function and investigate whether the acceleration phases of the universe can be consistently described by this model. In the symmetric teleparallel formulation, and under a Friedmann--Lemaître--Robertson--Walker background, three distinct branches of the connection arise, leading to three different cosmological scenarios. We perform a detailed dynamical analysis of these models by examining the phase space and determining the asymptotic cosmological solutions. The analysis reveals a rich hierarchy of critical points, including matter-dominated epochs, kinetic-dominated stiff-fluid regimes, and steep potential-dominated de Sitter solutions, along with asymptotic trajectories that approach Big Crunch or Big Rip singularities, as well as transient, unstable matter-dominated eras. The stability of the steep potential-dominated de Sitter points is further studied using Center Manifold Theory, showing that, under specific parametric conditions, the model can provide a unified description of both the early and late-time acceleration phases of the universe.",
New submissions,Duality Structures in Unimodular Electrovacuum Gravity,"Jack C. M. Hughes,Fedor V. Kusmartsev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We show that the structure of the Lorentz group in four dimensions is such that unimodular (trace-free) gravity in electrovacuum can be consistently represented as an algebraic condition on the symmetric product space of 2-forms. This condition states that the commutator between the Riemann tensor and the Hodge dual must be equal to the commutator between Hodge dual and an operator constructed from the Maxwell tensor; symbolically, $[\text{Riem}, \star] = [\star, F \boxtimes F]$. We show that this condition is equivalent to the trace-free field equations, that the right-hand-side vanishes if and only if the energy-momentum tensor vanishes (recovering the appropriate Einstein spacetime limit) and that this condition can be solved in the spherically symmetric ansatz to yield Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter uniquely. This analysis suggests that the conceptual distinction between unimodular gravity and General Relativity is one of emphasis on how irreducible representations of the Riemann tensor are constrained by the existence of energy-momentum and the associated field equations.",
New submissions,Using Gauge Covariant Lie Derivatives in Einstein-Cartan and Metric Teleparallel Theories of Gravity,"R. J. van den Hoogen,H. Forance,L. Taylor,M. Lawton",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A procedure to determine the initial ansatz for the co-frame and spin connection characterizing a Riemann-Cartan geometry respecting a given group of continuous symmetries is illustrated. Given a particular group of symmetries and assuming an orthonormal gauge we can determine the co-frame and corresponding spin connection having this symmetry group by employing an gauge covariant Lie derivative. This gauge covariant Lie derivative when applied to the metric and co-frame determines the values of an antisymmetric compensating matrix. The derivative of this matrix then yields the corresponding spin connection. The procedure is straightforward and can be employed for any Riemann-Cartan geometry having symmetries including those with a non-trivial isotropy subgroup. Here we illustrate the procedure with numerous examples, including, spherically symmetric, plane symmetric, locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type III, Gödel, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter geometries. Further, we have also solved the zero curvature constraint to obtain the resulting spin connection for the corresponding metric teleparallel geometry having this same symmetry group. We complete this investigation by including the Lorentz transformation that yields the proper frame for some of these metric teleparallel geometries.",
Cross submissions,Scalar-induced gravitational waves including isocurvature perturbations with lattice simulations,Xiang-Xi Zeng,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) open a unique window into early-universe physics. While their generation from adiabatic perturbations has been extensively studied, the contribution from isocurvature perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a lattice simulation framework to compute the stochastic gravitational wave background from both pure isocurvature and mixed initial conditions. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with semi-analytical predictions in the pure isocurvature case. We further analyze multi-peak structures under general initial conditions and find that they closely match those produced in purely adiabatic scenarios. Additionally, we examine SIGWs in early matter-dominated eras, revealing that the peak amplitude and spectral slope are sensitive to the microphysical properties of the dominant field, such as the primordial black hole mass, abundance, or soliton decay rate. This study establishes lattice simulations as a robust tool for predicting SIGW spectra from complex primordial perturbations, with important implications for interpreting current and future gravitational wave observations.",
Cross submissions,The anisotropic expansion rate of the local Universe and its covariant cosmographic interpretation,"Basheer Kalbouneh,Christian Marinoni,Roy Maartens,Julien Bel,Jessica Santiago,Chris Clarkson,Maharshi Sarma,Jean-Marc Virey",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Without making any assumption on the underlying geometry and metric of the local Universe, we provide a measurement of the expansion rate fluctuation field using the Cosmicflows-4 and Pantheon+ samples in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.1$ ($30 \,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc} < R < 300\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$). The amplitude of the anisotropic fluctuations is found to be of order a few percent relative to the monopole of the expansion rate.We further decompose the expansion rate fluctuation field into spherical harmonic components and analyze their evolution with redshift across the studied redshift range. At low redshift, the dipole is clearly dominant, with an amplitude of $\sim (2.2 \pm 0.15)\times 10^{-2}$, significantly larger than the higher--order modes. As redshift increases, the dipole amplitude steadily decreases, reaching roughly half its value in the highest redshift bin investigated. The quadrupole is also significant, at about half the dipole amplitude, and persists across all redshift bins, with no clear decreasing trend, although uncertainties grow at higher redshift. A nonzero octupole is also detected at low redshift. The dipole, quadrupole, and octupole components are found to be aligned, exhibiting axial symmetry around a common axis ($l = 295^\circ,\, b = 5^\circ$).We interpret the observed fluctuations in the expansion rate within the framework of covariant cosmography. Our results indicate that the multipoles of the expansion rate fluctuation field are primarily driven by a strong quadrupole in the covariant Hubble parameter, together with dipole and octupole contributions from the covariant deceleration parameter. These few parameters suffice to reconstruct the luminosity distance with high precision out to $z \sim 0.1$, in a manner that is model--independent, non--perturbative, and free from assumptions about peculiar velocities.",
Cross submissions,Suppression of scalar perturbations due to a heavy axion,"Kai-Ge Zhang,Jian-Feng He,Chengjie Fu,Zong-Kuan Guo",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to gauge fields via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta during inflation. The amplified gauge fields act as a source for both scalar and tensor perturbations. In this work, we propose a mechanism for suppressing scalar perturbations while sourcing strong tensor perturbations. We present an implementation of such a mechanism, demonstrating that sourced tensor perturbations are expected to be detected by upcoming next-generation CMB experiments.",
Cross submissions,Existence of ghost-eliminating constraints in multivielbein theory,"J. Flinckman,S. F. Hassan",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We perform a Hamiltonian constraint analysis of the multivielbein theory proposed inarXiv:1804.09723. The analysis shows that the secondary constraints have the correct form to constrain the dynamical variables, thereby eliminating the problematic ghost modes that generally plague theories of interacting spin-2 fields. Under mild restrictions on the solution space, we also identify the tertiary constraints and show that these eliminate the canonical momenta associated with the ghost modes. Our analysis confirms that the theory with $N$ interacting vielbeins propagates $2+5(N-1)$ modes, corresponding to a nonlinear theory of one massless and $N-1$ massive spin-2 fields free of the Boulware-Deser ghost instabilities.",
Cross submissions,An account of the arrow of time when scale is surplus,"Sean Gryb,Simon Friederich",History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Existing accounts of the cosmological arrow of time face a dilemma: generalist approaches that posit time-asymmetric laws lack independent motivation, while particularist approaches that invoke a Past Hypothesis face serious conceptual and explanatory problems. We propose a novel account that dispenses with the need for both time-asymmetric laws and a Past Hypothesis. Instead, it is centred around a symmetry argument that reveals attractors and so-called 'Janus points'. The main idea is that the global spatial scale of the Universe is not empirically accessible, and should therefore be treated as surplus structure. By contrast, the Hubble parameter, which encodes the relative rate of change of scale, is empirically accessible. Once the scale redundancy is eliminated, the empirically meaningful description of cosmic dynamics involves a drag-like variable that transforms in a way that preserves time-reversal invariance. The resulting space of dynamical possibilities possesses universal attractors and Janus points, giving rise to particular states in which observers experience a cosmological arrow of time akin to our own. We illustrate the proposal by applying it to cosmological and gravitational N-body models, showing how it accounts, respectively, for the rapid cooling of the early universe and its relative smoothness.",
Cross submissions,BaBy Cosmic Tension,Christophe Ringeval,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We show that the recently released B-mode polarisation data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) favour a non-vanishing contribution of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin which is in tension with the previous BICEP-Keck (BK) measurements. Our analysis uses the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra, with theoretically motivated priors, on the multifrequency SPT likelihoods complemented by the latest Planck satellite data products. The SPT measurements provide 1.0 bit of information gain on the first slow-roll parameter, which is higher than the 0.9 bit provided by BK even though the SPT sensitivity is five times lower. Moreover, the Bayesian dimensionality on the same parameter exceeds 1.5 for SPT versus 0.3 for BK showing that it is overconstrained by the SPT data. Even if this BB-tension could be the result of a yet to be understood foreground, our findings should motivate for a closer analysis of this unexpected B-modes excess.",
Cross submissions,Application of the holographic equations of state for modeling experiments on heavy ion collisions,"A. V. Anufriev,V. N. Kovalenko",Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we propose a method for numerical modeling of the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions using a holographic equation of state. Machine learning methods were applied to address the regression and optimization issues during the calibration of the relevant parameters using the LQCD results for quark masses that approximate the physical values. Numerical simulations are performed using the iEBE-MUSIC and vHLLE-SMASH frameworks, which incorporate certain relativistic hydrodynamics solvers. We modify the code by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model and SMASH. Finally, the spectra of produced hadrons are computed using a hybrid iSS+UrQMD and Hadron Sampler+SMASH approaches at the freeze-out stage.12 p",
Cross submissions,Revisiting Lagrangian Formulation of Stochastic inflation,"Rajat Kumar Panda,Sukanta Panda,Abbas Tinwala",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We revisit the Lagrangian formulation of stochastic inflation, where the path-integral approach is employed to derive the Langevin equation governing the dynamics of long-wavelength fields, in contrast to the standard method where the Langevin equation is derived directly from the equation of motion of the full quantum field. Focusing on a massless, minimally coupled scalar field with quartic self-interaction in a de Sitter background, we re-derive the formal expression for the influence functional that encapsulates the effects of short-wavelength fields up to second order in the coupling constant, and compare our results with those obtained in earlier works. In doing so, we highlight certain subtleties that have been previously overlooked, including the non-orthogonality between long- and short-wavelength modes, which we analyze in detail, as well as the absence of a consistent prescription for handling general interaction terms in the imaginary part of the influence functional. The latter issue points to a broader challenge: the lack of a universally accepted framework for treating the imaginary component of effective actions.",
