New submissions,Conformal Gravity as a Deformed Topological Field Theory,James A. Reid,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of general relativity, the spin connection and coframe variables are incorporated into a single Lie algebra-valued connection called the MacDowell-Mansouri connection, $\omega$. From the curvature form $F$ of $\omega$ and an auxiliary field, $B$, one may formulate general relativity as a deformed topological field theory by constructing an action functional whose variation yields a set of field equations that are equivalent to the Einstein equations on shell. In this article, we show that when the fundamental length scale of the MacDowell-Mansouri connection is regarded as a dynamical variable -- a cosmological scalar field -- the field equations obtained from the variation of the resulting action are equivalent to the conformal Einstein equations on shell. Through the lens of Cartan geometry, we then discuss a notable geometrical difference between general relativity and its conformally transformed counterpart. Specifically, for the latter, we show that points in spacetime are infinitesimally approximated by homogeneous spaces (restricted to a point) whose radii are parameterised by the value of the cosmological scalar field.",
New submissions,On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory,"Seyda Elife Gönül,Huriye Gürsel",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-Moller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R'$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range.",
New submissions,Stable Islands of Weak Gravity,"Linus Thummel,Benjamin Bose,Alkistis Pourtsidou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$, and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force. Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI $w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.",
New submissions,Perturbative Hyperboloidal Extraction of Gravitational Waves in 3+1 Numerical Relativity,"Sebastiano Bernuzzi,Joan Fontbuté,Simone Albanesi,Anil Zenginoğlu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering, and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications. Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.",
New submissions,A spacetime-covariant approach to inertial and accelerated quantum clocks in first-quantization,"Eduardo A. B. Oliveira,Andre G. S. Landulfo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will radically alter our current notion of spacetime geometry. However, contrary to what was commonly assumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much larger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the superposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems whose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very promising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this work, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant formalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account for the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings with external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the (quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when attainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in terms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When this decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even with couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We then apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of quantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii) charged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our clocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix $\rho_{\tau_2|\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields not only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical expected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum fluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile.",
New submissions,Higher-dimensional electric-magnetic photon sphere uniqueness,Marek Rogatko,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In our paper we pay attention to the problem of uniqueness (classification) of higher-dimensional electro-magnetic static, asymptotically flat, non-extremal solutions of multi-dimensional Einstein (n-2)-form gauge field gravity theory, which possess a photon sphere. The photon sphere is uniquely described by its asymptotic data. Conformal positive energy theorem is the key tool in the proof.",
New submissions,Planckian bound on IR/UV mixing from cold-atom interferometry,"Giovanni Amelino-Camelia,Giuseppe Fabiano,Domenico Frattulillo,Flavio Mercati",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph),"IR/UV mixing (a mechanism causing ultraviolet quantum-gravity effects to manifest themselves also in a far-infrared regime) is a rare case of feature found in several approaches to the quantum-gravity problem. We here derive the implications for ""soft"" IR/UV mixing (corrections to the dispersion relation that are linear in momentum) of some recent cold-atom-interferometry measurements. For both signs of the IR/UV-mixing correction term we establish bounds on the characteristic length scale which reach the Planck-length milestone. Intriguingly, for values of the characteristic scale of about half the Planck length we find that IR/UV mixing provides a solution for a puzzling discrepancy between Cesium-based and Rubidium-based atom-interferometric measurements of the fine structure constant.",
New submissions,Quantum cosmological background superposition and perturbation predictions,"Kratika Mazde,Lisa Mickel,Patrick Peter",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Predictions from early universe cosmology typically concern primordial perturbations generated during epochs where effects arising from the quantum nature of gravity may be important; quantum vacuum fluctuations being stretched to cosmological scales during a phase of inflation. Quantizing the background is then done by assuming a single close-to-classical state over which perturbations grow, as well as a Born-Oppenheimer factorization throughout the relevant phase. We present a scenario in which although the latter factorization remains valid at all times, we allow the background state to be very non-classical by defining quantum trajectories through an eikonal approximation. We find that these trajectories asymptotically reproduce an almost classical behavior for the background, but the predictions for the power spectrum of perturbations can significantly differ.",
New submissions,Generalized Perturbed Kepler Problem: Gravitational Wave Imprints from Eccentric Compact Binaries,"Rajes Ghosh,R. Prasad,Kabir Chakravarti,Prayush Kumar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Observations of astrophysical binaries may reveal departures from pure Keplerian orbits due to environmental influences, modifications to the underlying gravitational dynamics, or signatures of new physics. In this work, we develop a unified framework to systematically study such perturbations in the ambit of perturbed Kepler problem, and explore their impact on eccentric orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission. Unlike traditional parametrized frameworks such as post-Newtonian and post-Einsteinian expansions, our approach offers a more source-specific modeling strategy, making it more natural to trace the physical origins of various model parameters. Starting from a general perturbed potential, we derive the modified orbit and compute the associated gravitational fluxes and phase evolution, assessing their observational relevance for both current and future detectors. This framework thus offers a general and physically transparent toolkit to probe such subtle effects in gravitational wave data.",
New submissions,General relativistic solutions with finite self-energy for a point charge under Bopp-Podolsky electromagnetism,Erik Amorim,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We establish the existence of a family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes that are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations of General Relativity coupled to the electric field of a static point charge obeying the equations of electromagnetism of Maxwell-Bopp-Landé-Thomas-Podolsky. The point charge is modeled as a naked singularity with non-positive bare mass. The singularity at the location of the charge is milder than that of the Reissner-Weyl-Nordström solution to the conventional Einstein-Maxwell equations, and, contrary to what happens for the latter, the electric-field energy of these solutions is finite.",
New submissions,Exact Analytical Traversable Wormhole Solutions in Teleparallel $F(T)$ Gravity with the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley Massive Graviton Sector,"Alexandre Landry,Yassine Sekhmani,Emmanuel N. Saridakis,Sunil K Maurya,Akram Ali",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In this paper, we derive a novel class of exact, static, spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solutions in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity augmented by the non-linear de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) graviton mass term. By using the Morris-Thorne ansatz with a generalized redshift function including constant, logarithmic, and power-law profiles, we rigorously integrate the dRGT-modified conservation laws together with the teleparallel field equations to reconstruct both the shape function $b(r)$ and the possible torsion-based teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. Our solutions, which accommodate both pressureless dust and dark-energy perfect fluids, are naturally expressed via special function representations. We verify the flaring-out condition $b'(r_0)<1$, demonstrate the absence of event horizons, and show that the null and weak energy conditions are either strictly satisfied or incur only controlled violations at the throat. These results establish teleparallel massive gravity as a self-consistent, mathematically rich framework for asymptotically flat wormhole geometries without necessarily invoking an explicit cosmological constant.",
New submissions,Dynamical neutron-star tides: The signature of a mode resonance,"P. Pnigouras,N. Andersson,F. Gittins,A. R. Counsell",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"Motivated by future opportunities in gravitational-wave astronomy and the ongoing effort to constrain physics under extreme conditions, we consider the signature of individual mode resonances excited during the inspiral of binary systems involving neutron stars. Specifically, we quantify how each resonant mode contributes to the effective (frequency-dependent) tidal deformability. The resonant solution is shown to be accurately represented by a new closed-form approximation, which sheds light on the involved phenomenology, and which should be useful for the development of precise waveform models and future parameter extraction efforts.",
Cross submissions,Learning geometries beyond asymptotic AdS,"Cheng Ran,Shao-Feng Wu,Zhuo-Yu Xian",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a data-driven method for holographic bulk reconstruction that works even when the spacetime is not asymptotically AdS. Given the data of boundary Green functions within a finite frequency window, we iteratively adjust a bulk metric with a finite radial cutoff until its holographic Green functions reproduce the boundary data. Based on the holographic Wilsonian renormalization group for the Klein-Gordon equation in an undetermined curve space, we construct a radial flow equation and transform it into a Neural ODE, which is an infinite-depth neural network for modeling continuous dynamics. Assuming the double-trace coupling $h$ in the Wilsonian action is real, we demonstrate that the Neural ODE can effectively learn the metrics with AdS, Lifshitz, and hyperscaling violated asymptotics. In particular, we apply the algorithm to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which slightly deviates from the conformal limit. In the hyperparameter space spanned by the rescaled temperature $\bar{T}$ and the radial cutoff $\epsilon$, we identify a critical curve along which the learned metric is close to AdS$_2$ black hole with finite cutoff. We derive an approximate analytical expression for this curve, from which an effective bulk dual of the SYK coupling $v$ is established. Our work provides a promising way for using machine learning to depict the novel bulk geometry dual to the non-conformal boundary systems in the real world.",
Cross submissions,Assessing Universal Relations for Rapidly Rotating Neutron Stars: Insights from an Interpretable Deep Learning Perspective,"Grigorios Papigkiotis,Georgios Vardakas,Nikolaos Stergioulas",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Relations between stellar properties independent of the nuclear equation of state offer profound insights into neutron star physics and have practical applications in data analysis. Commonly, these relations are derived from utilizing various realistic nuclear cold hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models, each of which should obey the current constraints and cover a wide range of stiffnesses. Concurrently, the field of multimessenger astronomy has been significantly enhanced by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, which increasingly incorporates deep learning techniques and algorithms. At the same time, X-ray spectral data from NICER based on known pulsars are available, and additional observations are expected from upcoming missions. In this study, we revisit established universal relations, introduce new ones, and reassess them using a feed-forward neural network as a regression model. More specifically, we mainly propose ``deep'' EoS-insensitive hypersurface relations for rapidly rotating compact objects between several of the star's global parameters, which achieve an accuracy of within $1\%$ in most cases, with only a small fraction of investigated models exceeding this threshold. While analytical expressions can be used to represent some of these relations, the neural network approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in complex regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the suggested network's predictions, since is based on a strong theoretical framework inspired by the field of cooperative Game Theory. Most importantly, these highly accurate universal relations empowered with the interpretability description could be used in efforts to constrain the high-density equation of state in neutron stars, with the potential to enhance our understanding as new observables emerge.",
Cross submissions,Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves,Partha Nandi Frederik G. Scholtz,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.",
Cross submissions,Fast radio bursts by stellar wind microlensing of a faint background source,Richard Lieu,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"By assuming the inverse square law of solar wind plasma density as representative of other stars, it is shown that just outside a star the {\it outward} deflection of a passing radio signal at $\nu\approx 1$~GHz (which is capable of penetrating the plasma) is about 5 times larger than the gravitational inward deflection by the star, and the ensuing lens equation which takes both effects into account is a cubic polynomial with three roots and a new strong lensing caustic. The geometric optics approach is valid for a radio source size $\lesssim 1$~pc. Microlensing magnification of a steady background source occurs typically over a timescale of milliseconds, resulting in $\approx 80$ Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) per day over the whole sky, which can only perturb the isotropy of FRB distribution at the several \% level. Moreover, repeating FRBs could be triggered by the periodic interception of the line-of-sight of the background source by members of a binary system. The temporal signatures of such FRBs are consistent with the power spectrum of solar wind density fluctuations on corresponding scales, except the mean density of the wind is a few times higher than the solar value.",
Cross submissions,Mergers Fall Short: Non-merger Channels Required for Galactic Heavy Element Production,"Muhammed Saleem,Hsin-Yu Chen,Daniel M. Siegel,Philippe Landry,Jocelyn S. Read,Kaile Wang",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key production channel for $r$-process elements in the Universe. However, observations of $r$-process abundances as inferred from stellar spectra of Milky Way disk stars, together with chemical evolution modeling, suggest that additional channels are needed to fully account for the $r$-process element enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In this study, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic [Eu/Fe] vs [Fe/H] abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to $r$-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. We find that neither neutron star-black hole mergers nor fast-merging binary neutron star populations can serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the viable sources of Galactic $r$-process enrichment and underscore the necessity of non-merger production channels.",
Cross submissions,Impact of black hole spin on low-mass black hole-neutron star mergers,"Rahime Matur,Ian Hawke,Nils Andersson",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The recent detection of GW230529 suggests that black hole-neutron star mergers may involve low-mass black holes, potentially producing detectable electromagnetic counterparts. Motivated by this, we perform eleven fully general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with and without neutrino treatment, targeting the inferred chirp mass of GW230529. We systematically vary the black hole spin from $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.0$ to $0.8$ in steps of $0.1$, making this the most comprehensive study of spin effects in black hole-neutron star mergers to date. We confirm our earlier findings of fast-moving ejecta ($v \geq 0.6\,c$) in this parameter regime and demonstrate a clear spin dependence, with fast-ejecta masses reaching up to $\qty{\sim e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$ for $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.8$. Most notably, we identify for the first time the presence of spiral wave-driven ejecta in black hole-neutron star mergers -- a phenomenon previously reported only in binary neutron star systems. The mass of this component grows significantly with spin, reaching levels up to $\qty{\sim 7e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$. These results establish a new spin-enhanced mechanism for powering blue kilonova emission in black hole-neutron star mergers, significantly extending the range of systems expected to produce observable electromagnetic counterparts.",
Cross submissions,Schwinger--DeWitt expansion for the heat kernel of nonminimal operators in causal theories,"Andrei O. Barvinsky,Alexey E. Kalugin,Władysław Wachowski",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We suggest a systematic calculational scheme for heat kernels of covariant nonminimal operators in causal theories whose characteristic surfaces are null with respect to a generic metric. The calculational formalism is based on a pseudodifferential operator calculus which allows one to build a linear operator map from the heat kernel of the minimal operator to the nonminimal one. This map is realized as a local expansion in powers of spacetime curvature, dimensional background fields, and their covariant derivatives with the coefficients -- the functions of the Synge world function and its derivatives. Finiteness of these functions, determined by multiple proper time integrals, is achieved by a special subtraction procedure which is an important part of the calculational scheme. We illustrate this technique on the examples of the vector Proca model and the vector field operator with a nondegenerate principal symbol. We also discuss smoothness properties of heat kernels of nonminimal operators in connection with the nondegenerate nature of their operator symbols.",
Cross submissions,Vacuum polarization in the horizonless Bardeen metric,"Andrés Boasso,Francisco D. Mazzitelli",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor for a massless quantum scalar field in the background of the horizonless Bardeen spacetime. Within the weak-field approximation, we show that the vacuum fluctuations differ significantly between conformally and non-conformally coupled fields, both in magnitude and in their behavior at short and intermediate distances. At large distances, we recover the universal asymptotic behavior previously observed in black hole and Newtonian star backgrounds. Going beyond the weak-field regime, we find that, for certain parameter ranges, the modes of the field can develop imaginary frequencies, leading to instabilities and an exponential growth of vacuum fluctuations. We also discuss critically the applicability of the anomaly-induced effective action for computing the renormalized stress-energy tensor in the conformally coupled case.",
