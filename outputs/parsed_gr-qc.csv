New submissions,Light deflection in axially symmetric stationary spacetimes filled with a moving medium,"Christian Pfeifer,Barbora Bezděková,Oleg Yu. Tsupko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The deflection of light rays near gravitating objects can be influenced not only by gravity itself but also by the surrounding medium. Analytical studies of such effects are possible within the geometrical optics approximation, where the medium introduces additional light bending due to refraction. These studies typically assume a cold non-magnetized plasma, for which light propagation is independent of the medium's velocity. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the general case of dispersive refractive media in motion and study its influence on light deflection. We consider an axially symmetric stationary spacetime filled with a moving medium, motivated by the interplay between rotational effects originating from the spacetime and those induced by the medium's motion. We begin by analyzing light deflection in the equatorial plane of a rotating object in the presence of a radially moving and rotating medium. Assuming a specific form of the refractive index enables a fully analytic treatment. In the particular cases of either pure radial or pure rotational motion, we obtain explicit expressions for the deflection angle. Next, we analyze the case of a slowly moving medium and identify two particularly interesting results. First, we show that, to the first order in the medium's velocity, the radial motion does not affect the light deflection. Second, assuming slow rotation of the gravitating object, we demonstrate that the black hole rotation and the medium motion can produce equivalent observational signatures. We find the quantitative condition under which these effects compensate each other. This relation becomes particularly clear for a Kerr black hole, discussed as an example.",
New submissions,Quasinormal ringing and Unruh-Verlinde temperature of the Frolov Black Hole,Akshat Pathrikar,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"In this study, we investigate electromagnetic and Dirac field axial-perturbations of a charged regular black hole arising from quantum gravity effects, commonly referred to as the Frolov black hole, a regular (nonsingular) black hole solution. We derive the master wave equations for massless electromagnetic and Dirac perturbations and solve them using the standard Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method along with Padé approximation. From these solutions, we extract the dominant and overtone quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies along with the associated grey-body factors, highlighting the deviations introduced by quantum gravity corrections compared to the classical case of Reissner-Nordström black hole. Furthermore, we analyze the Unruh-Verlinde temperature of this spacetime, providing quantitative estimates of how quantum gravity effects influence both quasinormal ringing and particle emission in nonsingular black hole models.",
New submissions,Emission of pairs of Minkowski photons through the lens of the Unruh effect,"Juan V. O. Pêgas,Robert Bingham,Gianluca Gregori,George E. A. Matsas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We discuss the emission of pairs of photons by charges with generic worldlines in the Minkowski vacuum from the viewpoint of inertial observers and interpret them from the perspective of Rindler observers. We show that the emission of pairs of Minkowski photons corresponds, in general, to three distinct processes according to Rindler observers: scattering, and emission and absorption of pairs of Rindler photons. In the special case of uniformly accelerated charges, the radiation observed in the inertial frame can be fully described by the scattering channel in the Rindler frame. Therefore, the emission of pairs of Minkowski photons -- commonly referred to as Unruh radiation -- can be seen as further evidence supporting the Unruh effect.",
New submissions,Six-dimensional cosmological models with conformal extensions,"Daniel Muller,Sergey G. Rubin,Ilya L. Shapiro,Alexey Toporensky",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider the background cosmological solutions in the $6D$ (six-dimensional) model with one time and five space coordinates. The theory of our interest has the action composed by the Einstein term, cosmological constant, and two conformal terms constructed from the third powers of the Weyl tensor. It is shown how the highest derivative terms in the equations of motion can be isolated that opens the way for their numerical integration. There are flat anisotropic solutions which make one of the flat isotropic subspaces to be static. Depending on the value of bare cosmological constant, either two-dimensional or three-dimensional subspace can be static. In particular, there is a physically favorable solution with three ``large'' space coordinates and two extra inner dimensions stabilized. This solution is stable for a wide range of coupling constants, but this requires a special value of the bare cosmological constant.",
New submissions,Weyl double copy in bimetric massive gravity,"Hugo García-Compeán,César I. Ramos",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"The Weyl double copy formalism, which relates the Weyl spinor with the square of the field strength, is studied in the context of Hassan-Rosen bigravity for stationary and time-dependent solutions. We consider the dyonic Kerr-Newman-(A)dS solution and the Plebański-Demiański metric in the context of bigravity. These solutions are studied in the Weyl double copy both with matter independently coupled and show that no massive modes are present in the Weyl spinor. The equations of motion for the gauge and scalar fields are those of Maxwell equations coupled to an external source, and massless Klein-Gordon equations with a conformal curvature term and an external source, all of them consistent with general relativity. For wave solutions, massive modes are manifest in the Weyl spinor and a formulation in bigravity for these massive modes is proposed. The resulting equations of motion are Proca equations with a conformal term and massive Klein-Gordon equations. In the case of the matter contributions for waves, we show how the resonance mass is present in equations of motion of the fields obtained from the Weyl double copy. The solutions studied are written in a Kerr-Schild form, connecting with the Kerr-Schild double copy.",
New submissions,Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity,Thomas Schürmann,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We prove a coordinate- and foliation-independent Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r$ on spacelike hypersurfaces of arbitrary spacetimes (with matter and a cosmological constant). The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p\,r \ge \hbar/2$, whose constant is optimal and never attained (Corollary). This result abstracts and extends the framework recently introduced for black-hole slices in [10].",
New submissions,Non-local Metric-Affine Gravity,"Salvatore Capozziello,Damianos Iosifidis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Non-local gravity can potentially solve several problems of gravitational field both at Ultra-Violet and Infra-Red scales. However, such an approach has been formulated mainly in metric formalism. In this paper, we discuss non-local theories of gravity in the metric-affine framework. In particular, we study the dynamics of metric-affine analogue of some well-studied non-local theories, by treating the metric and the connection as independent fields. The approach gives the opportunity to deal with non-local gravity under a more general standard. Furthermore, we introduce some novel non-local metric-affine theories with no Riemannian analogue and investigate their dynamics. Finally we discuss some cosmological applications of our development.",
New submissions,No-Go Theorem for Rotating Global Monopoles,"Yi Lu,Xiao-Yin Pan,Meng-Yun Lai,Qing-hai Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Global monopoles are topological defects predicted by certain grand unified theories and have been extensively studied for their astrophysical and cosmological implications, including their distinctive spacetime geometry and characteristic gravitational lensing effects. Despite this interest, an exact solution for a global monopole remains elusive, with research largely confined to approximations of the static, spherically symmetric case. This paper addresses the fundamental question of whether a rotating global monopole can exist as a solution to the coupled Einstein-scalar field equations. We first prove that metrics generated by applying the Newman-Janis algorithm to the static monopole are inconsistent with the scalar field's equation of motion. Furthermore, we perform an asymptotic analysis for general static, axially symmetric spacetimes and establish that the only such solution that is regular at large distances is the spherically symmetric one. These results lead to the definitive conclusion that non-trivial, rotating global monopole solutions are forbidden within the framework of Einstein's general relativity.",
New submissions,Photon rings and shadows of Kerr black holes immersed in a swirling universe,"Rogerio Capobianco,Betti Hartmann,Jutta Kunz,Nikhita Vas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We discuss photon rings around as well as shadows of Kerr black holes immersed in a swirling spacetime. We find that the spin-spin interaction between the angular momentum of the black hole and the swirling of the background leads to new interesting effects as it breaks the symmetry between the upper and lower hemispheres. One of the new features of the spin-spin interaction is the existence of up to three light rings for suitable choices of the angular momentum parameter $a$ and swirling parameter $j$. In comparison to the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a swirling universe, the light rings typically all possess different radii.",
New submissions,Perturbations of Minkowski spacetime with regular conformal compactification,Andrea Nützi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"We construct perturbations of Minkowski spacetime in general relativity, when given initial data that decays inverse polynomially to initial data of a Kerr spacetime towards spacelike infinity. We show that the perturbations admit a regular conformal compactification at null and timelike infinity, where the degree of regularity increases linearly with the rate of decay of the initial data to Kerr initial data. In particular, the compactification is smooth if the initial data decays rapidly to Kerr initial data. This generalizes results of Friedrich, who constructed spacetimes with a smooth conformal compactification in the case when the initial data is identical to Kerr initial data on the complement of a compact set. Our results rely on a novel formulation of the Einstein equations about Minkowski spacetime introduced by the author, that allows one to formulate the dynamic problem as a quasilinear, symmetric hyperbolic PDE that is regular at null infinity and with null infinity being at a fixed locus. It is not regular at spacelike infinity, due to the asymptotics of Kerr. Thus the main technical task is the construction of solutions near spacelike infinity, using tailored energy estimates. To accomplish this, we organize the equations according to homogeneity with respect to scaling about spacelike infinity, which identifies terms that are leading, respectively lower order, near spacelike infinity, with contributions from Kerr being lower order.",
New submissions,The trichotomy of primordial black holes initial conditions,"Cristiano Germani,Laia Montellà",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We show that the threshold to form a black hole, in an asymptotically flat and radiation dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe, is not solely (mainly) determined by the behaviour of the compaction function at its maximum, as earlier thought, but also by the three-dimensional curvature at smaller (but super-horizon) scales, which we call ""the core"". We find three classes of initial conditions characterized by an open (O), closed (C), or flat (F) FRW core surrounded by a shell with higher three-dimensional curvature. In the C case, the core helps the collapse so that the black hole formation threshold is there the lowest among all cases. Type-II black holes might only be generated by Type-O or F (each of those with different thresholds, with O being the highest) or by a Type-C with an effective F core. Finally, we argue that an F core is typically more probable for a sharp power spectrum, however, it is also more likely related to non-spherical initial conditions. On the other hand, a very broad power spectrum, which might be related to the observed NanoGrav signal, would favor the formation of Type-I black holes with a mass spectrum peaked at the Infra-Red scale.",
New submissions,QNM families: classification and competition,"Zhen-Hao Yang,Liang-Bi Wu,Xiao-Mei Kuang,Wei-Liang Qian",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The perturbation spectra of black hole (BH) beyond standard general relativity (GR) may exhibit complex structures with long-lived modes that generate echo-like modulations on the ringdown signal. However, a systematic framework for understanding the internal structure of such spectra, the physical nature of different mode families, and their dynamical excitation is still undeveloped. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a potential methodology that combines frequency-domain classification with time-domain analysis, using a hairy Schwarzschild BH that admits a double-peak perturbative potential as a theoretical platform. Our analysis of the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum identifies two distinct families of modes: the photon sphere (PS) family, arising from delocalized scattering resonances, and the echo family, corresponding to highly localized quasi-bound states. We then develop a windowed energy analysis framework in the time domain, which discloses a dynamic competition for dominance between these families. In particular, our results explicitly show that this competition is sensitive to the properties of the initial perturbation source, and that higher-overtone echo modes can dominate in the observed signal, which are in contrast to the standard PS mode in GR. This study establishes the dynamic evolution of this energy competition as a new observational signature for probing new physics and further motivate a supplemental framework for analyzing long-lived ringdown signals.",
New submissions,Universality of free fall in Planck-scale deformed Newtonian gravity,"Giuseppe Fabiano,Domenico Frattulillo,Christian Pfeifer,Fabian Wagner",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The universality of free fall is one of the most cherished principles in classical gravity. Its fate in the quantum world is one of the key questions in fundamental physics. We investigate the universality of free fall in the context of Planck scale modifications of Newtonian gravity. Starting from a doubly-special-relativity setting we take the Newtonian limit to obtain deformed Galilean relativity. We study the interaction between two test particles, subject to deformed Galilean relativity, and a classical, undeformed gravitational source, the Earth. Such an interaction is investigated here for the first time. Considering the two test particles falling freely in the source's gravitational field, we examine whether the universality of free fall is affected by deformed relativistic symmetries. We show that, in general, the universality of free fall is violated. Remarkably, we find that there exist distinguished models for which the universality of free fall is realized and which predict a specific modification of the Newtonian potential.",
New submissions,Point particles on the string in a three-dimensional AdS universe,"Petr Lukeš,Pavel Krtouš",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"BTZ spacetime is a long-known locally AdS solution to the Einstein equations in 1 timelike and 2 spacelike dimensions. Its static variant is interpreted as a black hole whose mass is related to the period of the angular coordinate. This solution can be parametrically continued into one without horizons but with a conical deficit in the center. Such a solution is interpreted as a spacetime with a massive particle. It has been shown that this particle can be in static equilibrium with a cosmic string passing through the spacetime to infinity. In this work, we explore the interaction of point particles with strings, such as a bound system of two particles connected by a string of finite length. We identify additive local mass in the static spacetimes and apply it to the case of particles and strings. Finally, using the cut and glue method, we construct the system of two particles oscillating on the string, which goes out of the scope of static systems.",
New submissions,On the uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences,"Michael Ebersold,Tania Regimbau",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.",
New submissions,From negative to positive $Λ$ through cosmological decreasing temperatures and its connection to spacetime foliation and string theory,"E. N. Nyergesy,I. G. Márián,A. Trombettoni,I. Nándori",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"String theories naturally predict a negative, while observations on the exponential expansion of the present Universe requires a positive value for the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Solution to resolve this discrepancy is known in the framework of string theory and given for Asymptotically Safe (AS) quantum gravity by using Renormalization Group (RG). However, the former might describes unstable worlds and the latter lacks the inclusion of temperature which is otherwise crucial in the early Universe. Here we present a proposal for resolving this conflict by using a modified thermal RG method where the temperature parameter $T$ is given by the inverse radius of the compactified time-like dimension, similarly to spacetime foliation. In our scenario not the dimensionful temperature $T$, but the dimensionless temperature $\tau = T/k$ is kept constant when the RG scale $k$ is sent to zero and string theory is assumed to take place at very high while AS quantum gravity at intermediate and low temperatures. We show that the modified thermal RG study of AS quantum gravity models at very high temperatures results in a negative cosmological constant while turns it into a positive parameter for low temperatures.",
Cross submissions,Expectations for the first supermassive black-hole binary resolved by PTAs II: Milestones for binary characterization,"Polina Petrov,Levi Schult,Stephen R. Taylor,Nihan Pol,Nima Laal,Maria Charisi,Chung-Pei Ma",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Following the recent evidence for a gravitational wave (GW) background found by pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, the next major science milestone is resolving individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The detection of these systems could arise via searches using a power-based GW anisotropy model or a deterministic template model. In Schult et al. 2025, we compared the efficacy of these models in constraining the GW signal from a single SMBHB using realistic, near-future PTA datasets, and found that the full-signal deterministic continuous wave (CW) search may achieve detection and characterization first. Here, we continue our analyses using only the CW model given its better performance, focusing now on characterization milestones. We examine the order in which CW parameters are constrained as PTA data are accumulated and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) grows. We also study how these parameter constraints vary across sources of different sky locations and GW frequencies. We find that the GW frequency and strain are generally constrained at the same time (or S/N), closely followed by the sky location, and later the chirp mass (if the source is highly evolving) and inclination angle. At fixed S/N, sources at higher frequencies generally achieve better precision on the GW frequency, chirp mass, and sky location. The time (and S/N) at which the signal becomes constrained is dependent on the sky location and frequency of the source, with the effects of pulsar terms and PTA geometry playing crucial roles in source detection and localization.",
Cross submissions,On Pre-Inflationary non Gaussianities,"M.Meo,A. Sagnotti(Scuola Normale Superiore and INFN, Pisa, ITALY)",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We explore the three-point amplitude of curvature perturbations in scenarios suggested by high-scale supersymmetry breaking in String Theory, where the inflaton is forced to climb a steep exponential potential. We can do it at the price of some simplifications, and more importantly with some assumptions on the softening effects of String Theory. These suggest a scenario proposed long ago by Gasperini and Veneziano, where the initial singularity is replaced by a bounce, and the resulting analysis rests on a scale $\Delta$ that leaves some signs in the angular power spectrum of the CMB. The amplitude comprises two types of contribution: the first oscillates around the original result of Maldacena and gives no further prospects to detect a non-Gaussian signal, but the second, which is subtly tied to the turning point at the end of the climbing phase, within the window 62<N<66 for the inflationary e-folds could be compatible with Planck constraints and potentially observable. The amplitudes involving the tensor modes contain only the first type of contribution.",
Cross submissions,Nonlinear causality and strong hyperbolicity of baryon-rich Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics,"Ian Cordeiro,Fábio S. Bemfica,Enrico Speranza,Jorge Noronha",Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present the first set of fully-nonlinear, necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing causal evolution of the initial data for the Israel-Stewart hydrodynamic equations with shear and bulk viscosity coupled to a nonzero baryon current. These constraints not only provide nonlinear causality: they also (a) guarantee the existence of a locally well-posed evolution of the initial data (they enforce strong hyperbolicity) when excluding the endpoints of the bounds, (b) arise from purely algebraic constraints that make no underlying symmetry assumptions on the degrees of freedom and (c) propagate the relevant symmetries of the degrees of freedom over the entire evolution of the problem. Our work enforces a mathematically rigorous foundation for future studies of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics with baryon-rich matter including neutron star mergers and heavy-ion collisions.",
Cross submissions,Bounding field excursions along null geodesics with applications to cosmology,"Aidan Herderschee,Aron C. Wall",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Scalar fields in theories of gravity often inhabit a moduli space of vacua, and coherent spatial or temporal variations in their expectation values can produce measurable gravitational effects. Such variations are expected in contexts ranging from inflationary cosmology to the near-horizon regions of near-extremal black holes, where they can deflect light rays and shift horizons. This work derives a quantitative field excursion bound (FEB) on scalar variations along null geodesics, expressed in terms of the expansion parameter. The bound follows from the Raychaudhuri equation, assuming that all other fields satisfy the null energy condition (NEC). It is saturated in certain spacetimes containing a timelike naked singularity. A possible generalization to semiclassical spacetimes that violate the NEC, but satisfy a strengthened version of the quantum focusing condition (QFC), is proposed. In cosmology, the FEB constrains the extent of large field excursions to be linearly bounded by the number of e-folds, independent of the inflationary model. This has notable implications for anthropic scenarios, where large excursions are often invoked to access favorable vacua.",
Cross submissions,Realistic Oscillon Interactions,"Angela Xue,Kyle Chen,Baylee Verzyde,Peter Hayman,Richard Easther",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Oscillons are long-lived nonlinear pseudo-solitonic configurations of scalar fields and many plausible inflationary scenarios predict an oscillon-dominated phase in the early universe. Many possible aspects of this phase remain unexplored, particularly oscillon-oscillon interactions and interactions between oscillons and their environment. However the primary long range forces between oscillons are gravitational and thus slow-acting relative to the intrinsic timescales of the oscillons themselves. Given that simulations with local gravity are computationally expensive we explore these effects by extracting individual specimens from simulations and then engineering interactions. We find that oscillons experience friction when moving in an inhomogeneous background and, because oscillons in non-relativistic collisions bounce or merge as a function of their relative phases, the outcomes of interactions between ``wild'' oscillons depend on their specific trajectories.",
Cross submissions,Dedicated-frequency analysis of gravitational-wave bursts from core-collapse supernovae with minimal assumptions,"Yi Shuen C. Lee,Marek J Szczepańczyk,Tanmaya Mishra,Margaret Millhouse,Andrew Melatos",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational-wave (GW) emissions from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) provide insights into the internal processes leading up to their explosions. Theory predicts that CCSN explosions are driven by hydrodynamical instabilities like the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection, and simulations show that these mechanisms emit GWs at low frequencies ($\lesssim 0.25 \,{\rm kHz}$). Thus the detection of low-frequency GWs, or lack thereof, is useful for constraining explosion mechanisms in CCSNe. This paper introduces the dedicated-frequency framework, which is designed to follow-up GW burst detections using bandpass analyses. The primary aim is to study whether low-frequency (LF) follow-up analyses, limited to $\leq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$, constrain CCSN explosion models in practical observing scenarios. The analysis dataset comprises waveforms from five CCSN models with different strengths of low-frequency GW emissions induced by SASI and/or neutrino-driven convection, injected into the Advanced LIGO data from the Third Observing Run (O3). Eligible candidates for the LF follow-up must satisfy a benchmark detection significance and are identified using the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm. The LF follow-up analyses are performed using the BayesWave algorithm. Both cWB and BayesWave make minimal assumptions about the signal's morphology. The results suggest that the successful detection of a CCSN in the LF follow-up analysis constrains its explosion mechanism. The dedicated-frequency framework also has other applications. As a demonstration, the loudest trigger from the SN 2019fcn supernova search is followed-up using a high-frequency (HF) analysis, limited to $\geq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$. The trigger has negligible power below $256 \, {\rm Hz}$, and the HF analysis successfully enhances its detection significance.",
Cross submissions,BAO miscalibration cannot rescue late-time solutions to the Hubble tension,"Davide Pedrotti,Luis A. Escamilla,Valerio Marra,Leandros Perivolaropoulos,Sunny Vagnozzi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil's advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension ""no-go theorem"", and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.",
Cross submissions,Description of Non-Spherical Black Holes in 5D Einstein Gravity via the Riemann-Hilbert Problem,"Jun-ichi Sakamoto,Shinya Tomizawa",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the solution-generating technique based on the Breitenlohner-Maison (BM) linear system, for asymptotically flat, stationary, bi-axisymmetric black hole solutions with various horizon topologies in five-dimensional vacuum Einstein theory. We construct the monodromy matrix associated with the BM linear system, which provides a unified framework for describing three distinct asymptotically flat, vacuum black hole solutions with a single angular momentum in five dimensions, each with a different horizon topology: (i) the singly rotating Myers-Perry black hole, (ii) the Emparan-Reall black ring, and (iii) the Chen-Teo rotating black lens. Conversely, by solving the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem using the procedure developed by Katsimpouri et al., we demonstrate that factorization of the monodromy matrix exactly reproduces these vacuum solutions, thereby reconstructing the three geometries. These constitute the first explicit examples in which the factorization procedure has been carried out for black holes with non-spherical horizon topologies. In addition, we discuss how the asymptotic behavior of five-dimensional vacuum solutions at spatial infinity is reflected in the asymptotic structure of the monodromy matrix in the spectral parameter space.",
Cross submissions,Metric Convergence of Sequences of Static Spacetimes with the Null Distance,Brian Allen,Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"How should one define metric space notions of convergence for sequences of spacetimes? Since a Lorentzian manifold does not define a metric space directly, the uniform convergence, Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) convergence, and Sormani-Wenger Intrinsic Flat (SWIF) convergence does not extend automatically. One approach is to define a metric space structure, which is compatible with the Lorentzian structure, so that the usual notions of convergence apply. This approach was taken by C. Sormani and C. Vega when defining the null distance. In this paper, we study sequences of static spacetimes equipped with the null distance under uniform, GH, and SWIF convergence, as well as Hölder bounds. We use the results of the Volume Above Distance Below (VADB) theorem of the author, R. Perales, and C. Sormani to prove an analog of the VADB theorem for sequences of static spacetimes with the null distance. We also give a conjecture of what the VADB theorem should be in the case of sequences of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with the null distance.",
