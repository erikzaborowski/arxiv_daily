New submissions,Hawking tunneling radiation with thermodynamic pressure,"Cheng Hu,Xiao-Xiong Zeng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Hawking radiation elucidates black holes as quantum thermodynamic systems, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between general relativity and quantum mechanics through particle emission phenomena. While conventional theoretical frameworks predominantly focus on classical spacetime configurations, recent advancements in Extended Phase Space thermodynamics have redefined cosmological parameters (such as the $\Lambda$-term) as dynamic variables. Notably, the thermodynamics of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes has been successfully extended to incorporate thermodynamic pressure $P$. Within this extended phase space framework, although numerous intriguing physical phenomena have been identified, the tunneling mechanism of particles incorporating pressure and volume remains unexplored. This study investigates Hawking radiation through particle tunneling in Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes within the extended phase space, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ is introduced via a dynamic cosmological constant $\Lambda$. By employing semi-classical tunneling calculations with self-gravitation corrections, we demonstrate that emission probabilities exhibit a direct correlation with variations in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Significantly, the radiation spectrum deviates from pure thermality, aligning with unitary quantum evolution while maintaining consistency with standard phase space results. Moreover, through thermodynamic analysis, we have verified that the emission rate of particles is related to the difference in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the emitted particles before and after they tunnel through the potential barrier. These findings establish particle tunneling as a unified probe of quantum gravitational effects in black hole thermodynamics.",
New submissions,"Gravastars with Kuchowicz Metric Potential in $f(R, Σ, T)$ Gravity","Bharat Singh,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This manuscript explores the gravastar model in the $f(R,\Sigma,T)$ gravity framework, with the help of Kuchowicz metric funcition, offering an alternative to black holes. A gravastar has three regions: interior, intermediate shell, and exterior. The interior region has pressure equal to negative density, generating a repulsive force across the thin shell. The intermediate shell contains ultra-relativistic plasma fluids, with pressure proportional to density, balancing the interior's repulsive force. The exterior region is a vacuum, described by a generalized Schwarzschild solution. Our specifications yield precise, singularity-free gravaster solutions with physically valid features in the $f(R,\Sigma,T)$ gravity framework, exploring strong gravity and anti-gravity aspects. The gravitational Lagrangian is based on an arbitrary function of torsion scalar $\Sigma$ and trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. Our $f(R,\Sigma,T)$ gravity analysis explores gravastars inner workings, revealing insights into gravity, strong gravity, and antigravity forces due to torsion effects. We examine shell properties like length, energy, entropy, and discussed junction conditions. Key findings include constant interior density and pressure, denser shell fluid at the outer boundary, and increasing shell length. These results illuminate gravastar behavior and fundamental gravitational principles.",
New submissions,Tidal Love numbers and quasi-normal modes of the ECO in a Dark Matter halo,"Kabir Chakravarti,Chiranjeeb Singha",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It is well-known that exotic compact objects (ECOs) are a class of objects categorised as Black Hole (BH) mimickers. ECOs have been shown to possess signatures distinguishing them from BHs. However, in our universe, no object exists in complete isolation. Consequently, any compact object, whether a BH or an ECO, must reside within some environment that inevitably influences the surrounding spacetime geometry due to back-reaction. In this paper, we investigate a scenario where an ECO is embedded in an environment of dark matter (DM). In this work, we assume two different models of the DM halo profile. We compute the Love numbers and GW echoes of this composite system to assess the impact of the surrounding dark matter halo. To analyze the echoes, we focus on odd-parity perturbations, while for calculating the tidal Love numbers, we consider both even and odd parity perturbations. We aim to understand how the DM properties couple to the ECO signatures in the Love number or the GW-echo signal, both of which have a strong bearing as observables in future-generation detectors.",
New submissions,Integrated effect of the cosmic space magnetic field on the acceleration noise of the TQ gravitational wave detection program,"Cheng-Long Yu,Jin Yan,Lin Ji,Wen-Ke Shi,Yi Zhang,Run-Qiu Liu,Hong-Qing Huo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Space Physics (physics.space-ph),"The TianQin(TQ) program is to deploy three satellites that can form an equilateral triangle in about 100,000 km Earth orbit to capture gravitational wave signals in the low-frequency band. In order to ensure accurate capture, noise needs to be analyzed and compensated. In this paper, we model and analyze the acceleration noise generated by the test mass affected by the magnetic field in space. In this paper, we use the Tsyganenko model as the background magnetic field of the TQ orbit, calculate the magnetic field and magnetic field gradient of the satellite orbit from 1997 to 2023, analyze the acceleration noise due to the coupling of the residual magnetic moment, the induced magnetic moment with the magnetic field in space and the acceleration noise due to the Lorentz force, and calculate the acceleration integrated noise of the influence of the magnetic field on the test mass from the power spectral densities of the modeled magnetic field and the magnetic field gradient. The acceleration integrated noise of the magnetic field influence on the test mass is calculated from the power spectral density of the magnetic field and the magnetic field gradient obtained by the model. Through the simulation study, the acceleration of the test mass induced by the magnetic field in the space of the TQ orbit reaches the magnitude of $10^{-16}ms^{-1}Hz^{-1/2}$, which is an important source of the influencing noise. The acceleration noise induced by the magnetic field and the Lorentz force is relatively higher than that induced by the magnetic field gradient.",
New submissions,Unveiling horizons in quantum critical collapse,"Marija Tomašević,Chih-Hung Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Critical gravitational collapse offers a unique window into regimes of arbitrarily high curvature, culminating in a naked singularity arising from smooth initial data -- thus providing a dynamical counterexample to weak cosmic censorship. Near the critical regime, quantum effects from the collapsing matter are expected to intervene before full quantum gravity resolves the singularity. Despite its fundamental significance, a self-consistent treatment has so far remained elusive. In this work, we perform a one-loop semiclassical analysis using the robust anomaly-based method in the canonical setup of Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a free, massless scalar field. Focusing on explicitly solvable critical solutions in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, we analytically solve the semiclassical Einstein equations and provide definitive answers to several long-standing questions. We find that regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like quantum state, encoding genuine vacuum polarization effects from the collapsing matter. Remarkably, the resulting quantum corrections manifest as a growing mode. Horizon-tracing analyses, incorporating both classical and quantum modes, reveal the emergence of a finite mass gap, signaling a phase transition from classical Type II to quantum-modified Type I behavior, thereby providing a quantum enforcement of the weak cosmic censorship. The most nontrivial aspect of our analysis involves dealing with non-conformal matter fields in explicitly time-dependent critical spacetimes. Along the way, we uncover intriguing and previously underexplored features of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.",
New submissions,Quantum Critical Collapse Abhors a Naked Singularity,"Marija Tomašević,Chih-Hung Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Classical critical collapse yields naked singularities from smooth initial data, challenging cosmic censorship and shaping the spectrum of primordial black holes. We show that one-loop vacuum polarization near the threshold alters this outcome. In analytically tractable Einstein-scalar critical spacetimes, regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like state whose stress tensor supplies a universal quantum growing mode. Its backreaction competes with the classical unstable mode, producing a shift of the critical point and a finite mass gap at the new threshold, thereby enforcing horizon formation even under arbitrary fine-tuning. In primordial collapse, the threshold shift enters exponentially into the formation fraction, while the gap truncates the low-mass tail -- effects that may reshape the predicted mass spectrum. These results provide the first consistent quantum treatment of critical collapse, offering definitive predictions for several long-standing problems.",
New submissions,Perturbations of Plane Waves and Quadratic Quasinormal Modes on the Lightring,"Kwinten Fransen,David Pereñiguez,Jaime Redondo-Yuste",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study second order gravitational perturbations on plane wave spacetimes from both the metric and curvature perturbation points of view. For the former, we explicitly use the isometries of the background to introduce tensor oscillator harmonics, which render Einstein's equations algebraic around symmetric plane waves. For the latter, we formulate the first and second order Teukolsky equations in a Geroch-Held-Penrose covariant way. Both approaches are useful in their own right, and together with our discussion on gauge freedom, they provide a foundation for the study of higher-order gravitational dynamics around plane wave spacetimes. Taking the perspective that these plane wave spacetimes arise from Penrose limits, we subsequently use these results to explore the nonlinear gravitational dynamics close to black hole lightrings. Specifically, we define and discuss quadratic quasinormal mode ratios, observe that they satisfy emergent selection rules, and make publicly available a code to compute them.",
New submissions,Decomposition of the connection in affine models of gravity: Can the connection tell us something about the metric?,"Oscar Castillo-Felisola,Bastian Grez,Aureliano Skirzewski,Jefferson Vaca-Santana",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph),"In physics geometrical connections are the mean to create models with local symmetries (gauge connections), as well as general diffeomorphisms invariance (affine connections). Here we study the irreducible tensor decomposition of connections on the tangent bundle of an affine manifold as used in the polynomial affine model of gravity. This connection is the most general linear connection, which allows us to build metric independent, diffeomorphism invariant models. This set up includes parts of the connection that are associated with conformal and projective transformations.",
New submissions,Correction to Hawking radiation in non-singular gravitational collapse,Hassan Mehmood,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent studies have shown that quantum gravity introduces important corrections to the process of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse expected from general relativity. In particular, instead of falling into a central singularity, the collapsing body undergoes a bounce and eventually exits its Schwarzschild radius, and this entire process of collapse and rebound can occur in a single asymptotic region. In this paper, particle creation during such non-singular gravitational collapse is studied. It is shown that the probability of spontaneous emission of particles differs from the well-known probability of Hawking radiation from classical gravitational collapse. It is argued that the different result implies a deviation from thermality. Some arguments are also adduced concerning how the Hawking process during non-singular dust collapse could potentially remove shell crossing singularities.",
New submissions,Restoration of the Lorentz symmetry of particle propagator in the ghost condensate model,"Suppanat Supanyo,Pitayuth Wongjun,Lunchakorn Tannukij",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The ghost condensate model has been proposed to protect the vacuum state of the cosmological phantom model yielding the gradient instability regime and the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking in the quantum level with the dispersion relation $\omega^2\sim k^4$. In this paper, we point out that the Lorentz symmetry in the propagator can be restored if the explicit Lorentz symmetry-breaking process is promoted. The particle excitation of the phantom field can propagate through spacetime with the Lorentzian dispersion relation $\omega^2=k^2$ in arbitrary background value. Moreover, the tree-level gradient instability regime can be removed under the characteristic Lorentz violation source of ultraviolet physics.",
New submissions,Shadow and Quasi-Normal Modes of Schwarzschild-Hernquist Black Hole,"Xing-Hui Feng,Guang-Yu Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper we study the shadow and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a black hole (BH) surrounded by a dark matter halo with Hernquist-type density distribution, which was reported in Ref. \cite{Cardoso:2021wlq}. In astrophysical scenarios, we find that the shadow radius enlarges as the compactness of halo increases. Therefore, we obtain an upper bound for the compactness ${\cal C}\le0.092$ with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. We calculate axial gravitational QNMs of the galactic BH up to ${\cal C}\sim{\cal O}(1)$, and fit the redshift relative to Schwarzschild QNMs up to second order in the compactness (for ${\cal C}\le0.3)$. These highly redshifted QNMs, resulting from large compactness, are key to modeling the dark matter halo.",
New submissions,Trace anomaly contributions to semi-classical wormhole geometries,"Mohammad Reza Mehdizadeh,Amir Hadi Ziaie,Francisco S. N. Lobo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate wormhole solutions within the framework of the semi-classical Einstein equations in the presence of the conformal anomaly (or trace anomaly). These solutions are sourced by a stress-energy tensor (SET) derived from the trace anomaly, and depend on two positive coefficients, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, determined by the matter content of the theory and on the degrees of freedom of the involved quantum fields. For a Type B anomaly ($\alpha=0$), we obtain wormhole geometries assuming a constant redshift function and show that the SET components increase with the parameter $\lambda$. In the case of a Type A anomaly ($\lambda=0$), we generalize previously known solutions, yielding a family of geometries that includes Lorentzian wormholes, naked singularities, and the Schwarzschild black hole. Using isotropic coordinates, we identify parameter choices that produce traversable wormhole solutions. Extending to the full trace-anomaly contribution, we solve the differential equation near the throat to obtain the redshift function and demonstrate that both the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars remain finite at the throat. We further analyze the trajectories of null and timelike particles, showing that the height and width of the effective potential for null geodesics increase monotonically with $\alpha$, while the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius also grows with larger $\alpha$. These results illustrate the rich interplay between trace anomaly effects and the structure and dynamics of wormhole spacetimes.",
New submissions,Backreaction of Halilsoy and Chandrasekhar waves,"Sebastian J. Szybka,Adam A. Zychowicz,Dominika Hunik",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We calculate the high-frequency limit of the Halilsoy and Chandrasekhar standing gravitational wave solutions. We show that the backreaction effect is the same for these classes of solutions and we analyze the causal structure of the effective spacetime. In addition, we rederive both classes of solutions without referring to the Ernst equation and generation techniques.",
New submissions,Topological charge and black hole photon spheres in massive gravity,"Pavan Kumar Yerra,Chandrasekhar Bhamidipati",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we investigate the existence and nature of the photon spheres (PS) in the background of four dimensional static and spherically symmetric black holes in the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory. Apart from the known case of one PS, there are regions in the parameter space of massive gravity where either two or no PS's exist outside the event horizon. Topological arguments show that, the case of one PS falls in the category of Einstein gravity (with topological charge $-1$), whereas, the cases with two or zero PS's belong to a different topological class with total charge zero. PS's of horizonless compact objects, also belong to the same class with total topological charge $0$, though, one distinction can be made with the black holes in massive gravity. While in the former case, the inner PS is stable, in the later case, it is the outer PS which is stable (the inner PS is unstable). We also study the landscape of possible regions of existence of standard and exotic photon spheres in the massive gravity parameter space, and correlate it with the horizon structure of the black holes.",
New submissions,Gravitational-wave inference at GPU speed: A bilby-like nested sampling kernel within blackjax-ns,"Metha Prathaban,David Yallup,James Alvey,Ming Yang,Will Templeton,Will Handley",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of the gravitational-wave Bayesian inference pipeline for parameter estimation and model comparison. Specifically, we implement the `acceptance-walk' sampling method, a cornerstone algorithm for gravitational-wave inference within the bilby and dynesty framework. By integrating this trusted kernel with the vectorized blackjax-ns framework, we achieve typical speedups of 20-40x for aligned spin binary black hole analyses, while recovering posteriors and evidences that are statistically identical to the original CPU implementation. This faithful re-implementation of a community-standard algorithm establishes a foundational benchmark for gravitational-wave inference. It quantifies the performance gains attributable solely to the architectural shift to GPUs, creating a vital reference against which future parallel sampling algorithms can be rigorously assessed. This allows for a clear distinction between algorithmic innovation and the inherent speedup from hardware. Our work provides a validated community tool for performing GPU-accelerated nested sampling in gravitational-wave data analyses.",
New submissions,Numerical investigation of the interior geometry of semiclassical evaporating spherical charged black holes,Gil Arad,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),We developed a numerical code which evolves the semiclassical Einstein's equation (with the quantum stress-energy contribution added as a source term) for the spherically symmetric metric inside an evaporating semiclassical charged black hole. An analytical approximation for the evolving semiclassical metric was recently developed by Ori and Zilberman (and will be briefly overviewed here). We seek to numerically check the validity of this analytical approximation. The Einstein equations in this case are partial differential equations for the two unknown metric functions which fully describe the spherically symmetric metric. We begin our numerical simulation close to the event horizon with regular initial data specified by a variant of the charged Vaidya metric. We then evolve the metric functions deep into the neighborhood of the inner horizon. We explore the results of running this numerical code in several representative cases. Our numerical simulations confirm the validity of the above mentioned analytical approximation in all these cases.,
New submissions,Revealing the origin of supermassive black holes with Taiji-TianQin network,"Ping Shen,Wen-Biao Han,Wen-Xin Zhong",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is a pivotal problem in modern cosmology. This work explores the potential of the Taiji-TianQin space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detector network to identify the formation channels of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 10$). The network substantially improves detection capability, boosting the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.2-3.0 (1.06-1.14) relative to TianQin (Taiji) alone. It increases the detection rate of MBHBs formed from light seeds (LS) by more than 2.2 times and achieves over 96\% detection efficiency for those originating from heavy seeds (HS). Furthermore, the network enables component mass estimation with relative uncertainties as low as $\sim 10^{-4}$ at the $2\sigma$ level. These improvements facilitate the assembly of a well-constrained population sample, allowing robust measurement of the fractional contributions from different formation pathways. The network achieves high precision in distinguishing between LS and HS origins (7.4\% relative uncertainty at $2\sigma$) and offers moderate discrimination between delay and no-delay channels in HS-origin binaries (24\%). However, classification remains challenging for delay versus no-delay scenarios in LS-origin systems (58\%) due to significant population overlap. In conclusion, the Taiji-TianQin network will serve as a powerful tool for unveiling the origins of SMBHs through GW population studies.",
Cross submissions,Detecting Causality with Conjugation Quandles over Dihedral Groups,Zining Fan,Geometric Topology (math.GT); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study whether quandle colorings can detect causality of events for links realized as skies in a $(2+1)$-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime $X$. Building off the Allen--Swenberg paper in which their $2$-sky link was conjectured to be causally related, they showed that the Alexander--Conway polynomial does not distinguish that link from the connected sum of two Hopf links, corresponding to two causally unrelated events. We ask whether the Alexander--Conway polynomial together with different types of quandle invariants suffice. We show that the conjugation quandle of the dihedral group $D_5$, together with the Alexander--Conway polynomial, does distinguish the two links and hence likely does detect causality in $X$. The $2$-sky link shares the same Alexander--Conway polynomial but has different $D_5$ conjugation-quandle counting invariants. Moreover, for $D_5$ the counting invariant alone already separates the pair, whereas for other small dihedral groups $D_3$, $D_4$, $D_6$, $D_7$ even the enhanced counting polynomial fails to detect causality. In fact we prove more that the conjugation quandle over D5 distinguishes all the infinitely many Allen-Swenberg links from the connected sum of two Hopf links. These results present an interesting reality where only the conjugation quandle over $D_5$ coupled with the Alexander--Conway polynomial can detect causality in $(2+1)$ dimensions. This results in a simple, computable quandle that can determine causality via the counting invariant alone, rather than reaching for more complicated counting polynomials and cocycles.",
Cross submissions,Probing dense environments around Sgr A* with S-stars dynamics,"Giovanni Maria Tomaselli,Andrea Caputo",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The orbits of stars around Sgr A*, the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, provide a unique laboratory for testing its environment with unprecedented precision. In this work, we compute the apsidal precession induced by extended matter distributions through Lagrange's equations and compare it with the measured precession of S2, reproducing and extending GRAVITY's constraints. In particular, we push bounds on boson clouds to larger gravitational couplings $\alpha$ and to the second-fastest superradiant mode. We also show that environments with mass of order $1\%$ of Sgr A* drive stellar orbits to decay by dynamical friction within a few Myr. The inner star cluster is however efficiently replenished, masking this effect observationally. We also show that orbital resonances from boson clouds have no impact on relevant timescales. While S2 currently provides the cleanest dataset, our framework is readily applicable to other stars that we identify as particularly promising, whose orbits will be measured with increasing accuracy, opening up new opportunities to probe the environment of Sgr A*.",
Cross submissions,"Exploring Pintopia: Reflection Branes, Bordisms, and U-Dualities","Vivek Chakrabhavi,Arun Debray,Markus Dierigl,Jonathan J. Heckman",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Representation Theory (math.RT),"The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric non-chiral supergravity (SUGRA) theories lead to strong constraints on the non-perturbative structure of quantum gravity. In this paper we determine Spin- and Pin-lifts of these dualities, which extend this action to fermionic degrees of freedom. Among other things, this allows us to access non-supersymmetric sectors of these low energy effective field theories in which bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are treated differently. We use this refinement of the duality groups, in tandem with the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture, to predict new codimension-two branes. These are a natural generalization of the recently discovered R7-branes of type II string theories. The first bordism groups for Spin-twisted duality bundles follow directly from the Abelianization of the duality groups. Viewing the SUGRA theory as the low energy limit of a toroidal compactification of M-theory, winding around these codimension-two defects enacts a reflection around one of the torus directions, which in the effective field theory appears as a charge conjugation symmetry. We establish some basic properties of such branes, including determining BPS objects which can end on it, as well as braiding rules and bound states realized by multiple reflection branes.",
Cross submissions,Action principle for $κ$-Minkowski noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theory from Lie-Poisson electrodynamics,Maxim Kurkov,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Lie-Poisson electrodynamics describes a semi-classical approximation of noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theories with Lie-algebra-type noncommutativities. We obtain a gauge-invariant local classical action with the correct commutative limit for a generic Lie-Poisson gauge model. At the semi-classical level, our results provide a relatively simple solution to the old problem of constructing an admissible Lagrangian formulation for the $U(1)$ gauge theory on the four-dimensional $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the classical action which yields the deformed Maxwell equations previously proposed in JHEP 11 (2023) 200 for this noncommutativity on general grounds.",
Cross submissions,Transport coefficients of charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes with arbitrary topology,"Moisés Bravo-Gaete,Luis Guajardo,Daniel F. Higuita-Borja,Julio A. Méndez-Zavaleta",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we present a novel family of exact black hole solutions constructed in the context of five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. These solutions add a non-linear charge to the Bañados-Teitelboim-Zanelli-like configurations known to exist with arbitrary Thurston horizon geometry. We establish constraints on the parameter space defining physically viable black holes, aligning with the standard energy conditions. An explicit proof of the first law of thermodynamics within our scenario is provided. We also employ holographic techniques to characterize the DC conductivities for the distinct horizon geometries, identifying a critical temperature indicative of phase transitions and exploring pertinent limits.",
Cross submissions,Plasma wakefield: from accelerators to black holes,"Pisin Chen,Yung-Kun Liu",Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Commemorating the 2024 S. Chandrasekhar Prize, this review provides a retrospective on the genesis and evolution of plasma wakefield acceleration. It traces the journey from prehistory and the invention of the Plasma Wakefield Accelerator (PWFA), the establishment of its theoretical cornerstones, to its profound reverberations across fundamental physics, including astrophysics and analog gravity. The narrative emphasizes conceptual evolution, key theoretical breakthroughs, and future outlook, culminating in a vision for hybrid schemes and next-generation colliders. In addition to application to particle accelerators and high energy collider physics, it is found that plasma wakefield, with its ultra-intense acceleration, can also be applied to investigate gravity effects in the laboratory based on Einstein's equivalence principle. A specific example is accelerating flying relativistic plasma mirrors to investigate the celebrated black hole Hawking evaporation and the associated information loss paradox. We describe an ongoing experiment, AnaBHEL (Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers), which aims at shedding some lights on the black hole information loss paradox.",
Cross submissions,A Critical Point on the Hairy Black Hole Phase Boundary in the Improved Holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theory,"Hong Guo,Wei-Liang Qian,Bean Wang",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we investigate the hairy black hole solutions and their dual phase diagram in the improved holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD)this http URLthe gravitational perspective, the rich phase structures observed in the dual boundary field theory originate from the intricate interplay between the scalar field formalism and the Maxwell field coupling mechanism. Two distinct types of hairy black hole solutions are found in this framework. Type-I hairy black holes are predominantly governed by scalar potential dynamics, whereas Type-II solutions emerge through nonminimal coupling to the $U(1)$ gauge field. We map out the phase distribution in the $(\mu_B,T)$ parameter plane and delineate the boundary separating these two hairy phases. The phase diagram exhibits a first-order phase transition line consistent with previous findings, accompanied by a subtle third-order phase transition line that terminates at a critical point positioned at the turning point of the entire phase boundary curve. Our results complement existing research on holographic EMD theory by offering a comprehensive characterization of phase distributions, transition boundaries, and their gravitational sector interpretations. These insights will enable more effective engineering of specific phase structures for simulating strongly coupled systems through targeted modifications to the EMD model.",
Cross submissions,Page curves and island's delays in asymptotically flat 2d spacetimes with injections,Yuuta Saito,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore spacetimes with multiple energy injections in asymptotically flat two-dimensional black hole and analyze the entanglement entropy in such spacetimes. This work is an extension of the setup of the single-injection case, by F.~F.~Gautason, L.~Schneiderbauer, W.~Sybesma and L.~Thorlacius, to include the multiple energy injections. We derive the solution of the model, by J.~G.~Russo, L.~Susskind and L.~Thorlacius, for a general number $n$ of the total injections, and discuss the entropy only for the case $n=2$. The essential point of this work is in the delay of the island. This delay makes the intermediate state necessary, where the island's endpoint lies between the 1st and the 2nd injections while the observer is located after the 2nd injection. The intermediate state makes the entanglement entropy evolve continuously across the 2nd injection time.",
Cross submissions,Primordial black holes versus their impersonators at gravitational wave observatories,"Andrea Begnoni,Stefano Profumo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The detection of primordial black holes (PBHs) would mark a major breakthrough, with far-reaching implications for early universe cosmology, fundamental physics, and the nature of dark matter. Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\geq 3\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \lesssim 2 M_\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.2$.",
Cross submissions,Beyond the Starobinsky model after ACT,"Dhong Yeon Cheong,Min Gi Park,Seong Chan Park",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We revisit higher order corrections to the Starobinsky inflationary model using the most recent P-ACT-LB-BK18 data, which exhibits a mild but definite tension with the predictions of the original model. Our results demonstrate how even small {higher order} deformations of the Ricci scalar (e.g. $R^3, R^4,\cdots$) can bring the model into better agreement with current data and impose nontrivial constraints on the post-inflationary dynamics.",
Cross submissions,On the local existence for the characteristic initial value problem for the Einstein-Dirac system,"Peng Zhao,Xiaoning Wu",Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate the characteristic initial value problem for the Einstein-Dirac system, a model governing the interaction between gravity and spin-$1/2$ fields. We apply Luk's strategy \cite{Luk12} and prove a semi-global existence result for this coupled Einstein-Dirac system without imposing symmetry conditions. More precisely, we construct smooth solutions in a rectangular region to the future of two intersecting null hypersurfaces, on which characteristic initial data are specified. The key novelty is to promote the symmetric spinorial derivatives of the Dirac field to independent variables and to derive a commuted ""Weyl-curvature-free"" evolution system for them. This eliminates the coupling to the curvature in the energy estimates and closes the bootstrap at the optimal derivative levels. The analysis relies on a double null foliation and incorporates spinor-specific techniques essential to handling the structure of the Dirac field.",
Cross submissions,Timelike Entanglement Entropy in Higher Curvature Gravity,"Zi-Xuan Zhao,Long Zhao,Song He",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work investigates holographic timelike entanglement entropy in higher curvature gravity, with a particular focus on Lovelock theories and on the role of excited states. For strip subsystems, higher-curvature terms are found to affect the imaginary part of the entropy in a dimension-dependent manner, while excited states contribute solely to the real part. For the cases analyzed, spacelike and timelike entanglement entropies exhibit proportional relations: vacuum contributions differ by universal phase factors, while excitation contributions are linked by dimension-dependent rational coefficients. For hyperbolic subsystems, the timelike entanglement entropy computed via complex extremal surfaces is shown to agree with results obtained through analytic continuation, with imaginary contributions appearing in all dimensions. Higher-curvature corrections are explicitly calculated in five- and $(d+1)$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity, illustrating the applicability of the complex surface prescription to general Lovelock corrections. These results provide a controlled setting to examine the influence of higher-curvature interactions on holographic timelike entanglement entropy, and clarify its relation to vacuum and excited-state contributions.",
Cross submissions,GWTC-4.0: Constraints on the Cosmic Expansion Rate and Modified Gravitational-wave Propagation,"TheLIGO Scientific Collaboration, theVirgo Collaboration, theKAGRA Collaboration",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze data from 142 of the 218 gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) to estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ jointly with the population properties of merging compact binaries. We measure the luminosity distance and redshifted masses of GW sources directly; in contrast, we infer GW source redshifts statistically through i) location of features in the compact object mass spectrum and merger rate evolution, and ii) identifying potential host galaxies in the GW localization volume. Probing the relationship between source luminosity distances and redshifts obtained in this way yields constraints on cosmological parameters. We also constrain parameterized deviations from general relativity which affect GW propagation, specifically those modifying the dependence of a GW signal on the source luminosity distance. Assuming our fiducial model for the source-frame mass distribution and using GW candidates detected up to the end of the fourth observing run (O4a), together with the GLADE+ all-sky galaxy catalog, we estimate $H_0 = 76.6^{+13.0}_{-9.5} (76.6^{+25.2}_{-14.0})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is reported as a median with 68.3% (90%) symmetric credible interval, and includes combination with the $H_0$ measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. Using a parametrization of modified GW propagation in terms of the magnitude parameter $\Xi_0$, we estimate $\Xi_0 = 1.2^{+0.8}_{-0.4} (1.2^{+2.4}_{-0.5})$, where $\Xi_0 = 1$ recovers the behavior of general relativity.",
Cross submissions,Prominence: A discriminator of gravitational wave signals,"João Gonçalves,Danny Marfatia,António P. Morais",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The concept of prominence is familiar to signal engineers, topographers and mountaineers. We introduce Prominence $\mathcal P$ as a discriminator of gravitational wave (GW) signals. We treat black hole and neutron star binaries as astrophysical background sources, and show how $\mathcal P$ can be used to distinguish between GW spectra produced by first-order phase transitions, domain walls and cosmic strings, and combinations thereof. Prominence can also be used to discriminate between these and off-piste sources of GWs. The uncertainty in the measured energy density in GWs at Pulsar Timing Arrays needs to be smaller than $\sim 4\%$ for $\mathcal{P}$ to achieve discrimination at 3$\sigma$. LISA and ET data are expected to have sufficiently small uncertainties that Prominence can play a central role in their analysis.",
Cross submissions,Hidden simplicity in the scattering for neutron stars and black holes,"Rafael Aoude,Andreas Helset",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Heavy particle effective theory applied to spinning black holes provides a natural framework in which propagators linearize and numerators exponentiate. In this work, we exploit these two features to introduce Kerr generating functions, which describe the scattering of any probe on a Kerr black hole background to all loop orders. These generating functions can be used to perform the tensor reduction of multi-loop integrands simply by differentiation with respect to the spin. As a first application of the Kerr generating functions, we study a neutron star in a Kerr black hole background. We organize the integrand by the helicity configuration of the exchanged gravitons and provide compact all-loop-order results for several helicity sectors and a full four-loop $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$ result.",
