New submissions,York's Cavity Formalism and Quantum Modified Thermodynamics of (2+1)D Black Holes,"Prince A Ganai,Nadeem Ul Islam,Nazir A Ganaie",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of $(2+1)$ dimensional BTZ black holes using York's cavity formalism, in which the black hole is enclosed within a finite-radius boundary held at a fixed temperature. This canonical ensemble construction enables the precise derivation of thermodynamic quantities such as temperature, energy, entropy, pressure, and heat capacity via the integral Euclidean path approach. Extending this analysis, we incorporate quantum corrections through Barrow entropy, a modified entropy law motivated by possible quantum-gravitational effects. The Barrow entropy is given by $S_B = (A_+/4)^{1+\Delta}$, where $\Delta \in [0,1]$ represents the degree of fractalization of the horizon. For $\Delta > 0$, we derive the corresponding generalized free energy $F_B$, which reveals that the thermodynamic phase structure changes with increasing $\Delta$.The modified heat capacity of Barrow $C_B$ is also computed, which decreases with larger $\Delta$, indicating suppressed thermal stability. Moreover, we study the influence of quantum effects on the thermal response, by calculating the corrected Joule Thomson coefficient $\mu_B$ . We identify a well defined range $r_+ \leq r \leq 1.154\,r_+$ within which a stable black hole configuration can spontaneously nucleate from a background of hot flat space. Together, our results highlight York's cavity method as a robust tool to investigate black hole thermodynamics in lower dimensional gravity and show that Barrow's entropy introduces physically significant corrections that could signal the influence of quantum gravity near the horizon.",
New submissions,A viable wormhole model in a five-dimensional spacetime,Peter K.F. Kuhfittig,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper generalizes two of the author's earlier wormhole solutions that are characterized by an extra spatial dimension. This paper adds the assumption that the components of the line element are functions not only of the radial coordinate $r$ but of the extra coordinate $l$ as well, resulting in a significant generalization. It is shown that the throat of the wormhole can be threaded with ordinary matter and that the unavoidable violation of the null energy condition can be attributed to the extra dimension. To be consistent with string theory, we also assume that this extra dimension has a small magnitude.",
New submissions,"Neutron Star Radial Perturbations for Causal, Viscous, Relativistic Fluids","Daniel A. Caballero,Nicolás Yunes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Which of the multiple models of causal and stable relativistic viscous fluids that have been developed is best suited to describe neutron stars? The modeling of out-of-equilibrium effects in these relativistic, astrophysical objects must be one with care, as simple Newtonian intuition fails to remain causal. Radial stability of neutron stars is one of the primary conditions for the viability of such out-of-equilibrium models. In this paper, we study radial perturbations of neutron stars for the Eckart, the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun, and the Müller-Israel-Stewart fluid models of relativistic viscous fluids. We find that for small viscosity, the three models have the same stability properties: they are always stable to bulk and shear viscosity, but they can be unstable to heat conductivity if certain thermodynamic conditions are violated. For the latter case, we derive a necessary criterion for stability to heat conductivity that applies to all three fluids. Moreover, we show that the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun and the Müller-Israel-Stewart models force the perturbations to evolve on fast timescales. Specifically, the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun model has additional oscillatory perturbations that propagate with the speed of second sound, while the Müller-Israel-Stewart model MIS only exhibits decaying behavior on the fast timescale. This work therefore establishes the first formal results and criteria for radial stability of these three out-of-equiblirium fluid models on the non-trivial, relativistic background of neutron stars.",
New submissions,Lower dimensional black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics: causal structure and scalar perturbations,Rodrigo Dal Bosco Fontana,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the charged black hole solutions of a 2+1 nonlinear electrodynamical theory with cosmological constant. Considered as a one-parameter group of theories (the exponent of the squared Maxwell tensor) the causal structure of all possible black holes is scrutinized. We analyze the singularity character that each theory delivers together with their horizons and the plausible limitations in the black hole charges. The investigation demonstrates a rich structure of three different groups of theories, according to the qualitative behavior of the singularity, horizons and limitations in the geometric charges. For such groups we study the effect of a scalar field propagating in the fixed black holes spacetime. All geometries analyzed were stable to such linear perturbations, these evolving as usual quasinormal spectra of the black holes that we calculate in different cases.",
New submissions,"Wormhole Solutions and pre-inflationary in $F(R, T)$ Gravity with Axion Fields","Guo-He Li,Yeqi Fang,Yuchi Wu,Jun Tao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we investigate wormhole solutions and inflationary initial conditions in the coupled axion-inflaton/scalar field system within $F(R,T)$ gravity. Notably, the Euclidean action is reduced by approximately $10^5$ compared with the GR case. In Euclidean AdS spacetime, we construct Euclidean (semi-)wormhole geometries that naturally set inflationary initial conditions. To enhance the probability of sustained inflation and address the short inflation duration issue in the no-boundary proposal, we constrain $\lambda$ to $\lambda < -\kappa$ by analyzing the properties of the Euclidean action. This constraint causes the probability weight $ P \propto e^{-S_E} $ to favor high-potential regions, achieving sufficient inflation while maintaining a nearly Gaussian perturbation spectrum. The results suggest that matter-geometry coupling in $F(R,T)$ gravity provides a novel mechanism for reconciling quantum cosmology with observational requirements.",
New submissions,QuGrav: Bringing gravitational waves to light with Qumodes,"Dmitri E. Kharzeev,Azadeh Maleknejad,Saba Shalamberidze",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We propose using qumodes, quantum bosonic modes, for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves via the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, where a gravitational wave resonantly converts into a single photon in a magnetized cavity. For an occupation number $n$ of the photon field in a qumode, the conversion probability is enhanced by a factor of $n+1$ due to Bose-Einstein statistics. Unlocking this increased sensitivity entails the ability to continuously prepare the qumode and perform non-demolition measurement on the qumode-qubit system within the qumode coherence time. Our results indicate that, at microwave frequencies and with existing technology, the proposed setup can attain sensitivities within 1.7 orders of magnitude of the cosmological bound. With anticipated near-future improvements, it has the potential to surpass this limit and pave the way for the first exploration of high-frequency cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds. At optical frequencies, it can enhance the sensitivity of current detectors by one order of magnitude. That further enhances their potential in reaching the single-graviton level.",
New submissions,The Fast and the Frame-Dragging: Efficient waveforms for asymmetric-mass eccentric equatorial inspirals into rapidly-spinning black holes,"Christian E. A. Chapman-Bird,Lorenzo Speri,Zachary Nasipak,Ollie Burke,Michael L. Katz,Alessandro Santini,Shubham Kejriwal,Philip Lynch,Josh Mathews,Hassan Khalvati,Jonathan E. Thompson,Soichiro Isoyama,Scott A. Hughes,Niels Warburton,Alvin J. K. Chua,Maxime Pigou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Observations of gravitational-wave signals emitted by compact binary inspirals provide unique insights into their properties, but their analysis requires accurate and efficient waveform models. Intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (I/EMRIs), with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 10^2$, are promising sources for future detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Modelling waveforms for these asymmetric-mass binaries is challenging, entailing the tracking of many harmonic modes over thousands to millions of cycles. The FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) modelling framework addresses this need, leveraging precomputation of mode data and interpolation to rapidly compute adiabatic waveforms for eccentric inspirals into zero-spin black holes. In this work, we extend FEW to model eccentric equatorial inspirals into black holes with spin magnitudes $|a| \leq 0.999$. Our model supports eccentricities $e < 0.9$ and semi-latus recta $p < 200$, enabling the generation of long-duration IMRI waveforms, and produces waveforms in $\sim 100$ ms with hardware acceleration. Characterising systematic errors, we estimate that our model attains mismatches of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (for LISA sensitivity) with respect to error-free adiabatic waveforms over most of parameter space. We find that kludge models introduce errors in signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as great as $^{+60\%}_{-40\%}$ and induce marginal biases of up to $\sim 1\sigma$ in parameter estimation. We show LISA's horizon redshift for I/EMRI signals varies significantly with $a$, reaching a redshift of $3$ ($15$) for EMRIs (IMRIs) with only minor $(\sim10\%)$ dependence on $e$ for an SNR threshold of 20. For signals with SNR $\sim 50$, spin and eccentricity-at-plunge are measured with uncertainties of $\delta a \sim 10^{-7}$ and $\delta e_f \sim 10^{-5}$. This work advances the state-of-the-art in waveform generation for asymmetric-mass binaries.",
New submissions,Covariant dynamics from static spherically symmetric geometries,"Cong Zhang,Zhoujian Cao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that any one-parameter family of static, spherically symmetric spacetime metrics can be embedded as the unique vacuum solution set of a generally covariant theory of pure gravity. These theories, involving at most second-order derivatives of metrics, are uniquely specified up to two arbitrary functions that leave the metric unchanged, by a recently derived covariance condition in the Hamiltonian framework. This result solves the inverse problem of Birkhoff's theorem in full generality and establishes a systematic approach for reconstructing covariant dynamics from a given geometry. The framework applies broadly to quantum-gravity-inspired metrics, including regular black hole models, and provides a new tool for probing their dynamical and observational foundations.",
New submissions,"Late time behavior in $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity through Gaussian reconstruction and dynamical stability","Y. Kalpana Devi,S.A. Narawade,B. Mishra",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we explore modified gravity in the framework of $f(R, \mathcal{L}_m)$ theories by reconstructing the function $f(\mathcal{L}_m)$, where $\mathcal{L}_m = \rho$ is the matter Lagrangian, under the assumption of a pressureless, matter-dominated Universe. Using a non-parametric Gaussian process reconstruction technique applied to Hubble data, we obtain two viable models of $f(\mathcal{L}_m)$ : (i) a power-law model $f_1(\mathcal{L}_m) = \alpha \mathcal{L}_m^{b_1}$ with $b_1 \in [0.018, 0.025]$ and (ii) an exponential model $f_2(\mathcal{L}_m) = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{m0} \left(1 - e^{-b_2 \sqrt{\mathcal{L}_m/\mathcal{L}_{m0}}} \right)$ with $b_2 \in [2.3, 3.0]$. We then fix the parameter values within these reconstructed ranges and analyze the corresponding dynamical systems within the matter-dominated epoch by constructing autonomous equations. Phase-space analysis reveals the presence of stable critical points in both models, suggesting viable cosmic evolution within their domains of validity. Both the models exhibit stable attractor solution at late time, reinforcing their viability in explaining the late time cosmic acceleration without explicitly invoking a cosmological constant. Our results indicate that $f(R, \mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity with data-driven matter-sector modifications can offer a compelling alternative description of cosmic dynamics during the matter-dominated era.",
New submissions,Non-oscillatory gravitational quasinormal modes of Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter spacetime,"Z. Stuchlík,A. Zhidenko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Proper oscillation frequencies of black holes (quasinormal modes) of asymptotically de Sitter black holes were extensively studied, yet the non-oscillatory (purely imaginary) branch of modes of gravitational perturbations of the four-dimensional Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter solution was omitted in the literature. This branch of modes appears as deformations of the modes of empty de Sitter space. Here we find accurate numerical values of this branch of quasinormal modes and show that they are responsible for the exponential asymptotic tails.",
New submissions,Quasinormal spectra of a wormhole family: overtone features and a parameter-controlled redshift,"Abhisek Barman Maji,Sayan Kar(Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph),"Though investigated extensively in the past, we take a detailed relook at the study of quasinormal modes (QNM) in a known family of wormholes (ultrastatic ($g_{00}=-1$), as well as spacetimes with different, non-constant $g_{00}$), which includes the familiar Bronnikov-Ellis spacetime as a special case. Our focus here is to go beyond the fundamental mode and obtain some of the QNM overtones using a suitable numerical scheme. Scalar and axial gravitational QNMs including two or three overtones are obtained for the family of ultrastatic geometries and their parameter dependencies are shown explicitly. Further, we comment on how (a) the overtones may influence the time-domain profile in a perturbation and (b) in what sense, the use of overtones may help in distinguishing between different geometries within the family.Finally, we show how an effect somewhat similar to the so-called `environment induced redshift' of QNMs, introduced recently (arXiv:2412.18651), may be obtained for spacetimes with non-constant $g_{00}$, via an appropriate tuning of available metric parameters which systematically modify the shapes of the effective potentials arising in the perturbation equations.",
New submissions,Black hole photon ring beyond General Relativity: an integrable parametrization,"Jibril Ben Achour,Eric Gourgoulhon,Hugo Roussille",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In recent years, the shape of the photon ring in black holes images has been argued to provide a sharp test of the Kerr hypothesis for future black hole imaging missions. In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr geometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole parameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that end, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the Kerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the fundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides exhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the representants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of Petrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are encoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar angle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the radial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve, to which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to derive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term of the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result, we confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like objects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given inclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass and spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin parameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\alpha$. Therefore, future tests of the Kerr hypothesis could be achieved only provided one can measure independently the mass and spin of the black hole to break this degeneracy.",
New submissions,A class of charged and charged-Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a massless scalar field and some of their astrophysical aspects,"Fatemeh Sadeghi,Behrouz Mirza,Marzieh Moradzadeh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider a class of exact solutions to the Einstein equations in the presence of a scalar field, recently introduced in [arXiv:2307.09328,arXiv:2307.13588], and derive their generalized form with dyonic charges using Harrison transformations. For specific parameter values, this class of metrics includes the charged Fisher Janis Newman Winicour (FJNW) and gamma metrics. We then investigate the motion of neutral particles in the background of these metrics and derive the corresponding effective potential.Next, by applying Ehlers transformations, we introduce the NUT parameter into the Reissner Nordstrom metric in the presence of the scalar field. We also examine gravitational lensing, focusing on the effects of dyonic and NUT charges, as well as the scalar field, on the deflection angle of light. Finally, we explore the quasi normal modes associated with this class of metrics.",
Cross submissions,Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources,"Lorenz Zwick,Kai Hendriks,David O'Neill,János Takátsy,Philip Kirkeberg,Christopher Tiede,Jakob Stegmann,Johan Samsing",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e> 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.",
Cross submissions,Mitigating antenna gain errors with HyFoReS in CHIME simulations,"Haochen Wang,Panupong Phoompuang,Kiyoshi W. Masui,Arnab Chakraborty,Simon Foreman",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Hybrid Foreground Residual Subtraction (HyFoReS) is a new family of algorithms designed to remove systematics-induced foreground contamination for 21-cm intensity mapping data. Previously, the algorithm was shown to be effective in mitigating beam perturbations in sky maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). In this study, we apply HyFoReS to CHIME simulations and test the algorithm's ability to mitigate antenna gain-type systematics in polarized visibilities. Simulating a two-cylinder telescope similar to the CHIME pathfinder, we find that HyFoReS reduces foreground bias caused by bandpass perturbations to a level below the thermal noise, provided that the RMS value of the perturbations is on the order of $10^{-4}$ or lower. When tested with complex antenna-dependent gain errors, HyFoReS can reduce residual foreground bias in the power spectrum by up to three orders of magnitude. While noise bias and second-order perturbations are currently the limiting factors for the algorithm, we have demonstrated that HyFoReS can suppress gain-induced foreground leakage in polarized data from 21-cm telescopes, aiding in the detection of the 21-cm auto-power spectrum for hydrogen intensity mapping experiments.",
Cross submissions,$w_{dm}$-$w_{de}$ cosmological model with new data samples of cosmological observations,"Dorian Araya,Cristian Castillo,Genly Leon,Juan Magaña,Angie Barr Domínguez,Miguel A. García-Aspeitia",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We revisit a cosmological model where dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) follow barotropic equations of state, allowing deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework (i.e. $w_{dm} \neq 0$, $w_{de} \neq -1$) considering both, flat and non-flat curvature. Using a dynamical system approach, we identify equilibrium states that govern stability, expansion, and contraction. Expansion occurs when $H>0$, while contraction is linked to $H < 0$. Accelerated expansion arises from DE dominance, whereas radiation- and matter-dominated phases lead to deceleration. Some solutions are unphysical, because of density constraints, but viable cases offer insights into cosmic transitions, including the Einstein static universe, which allows shifts between accelerating and decelerating phases. We perform a Bayesian analysis with updated datasets, including observational Hubble data, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing systems, and baryon acoustic oscillations, to constrain the parameters $w_{dm}$ and $w_{de}$. Our results from the data joint analysis show consistency with $\Lambda$CDM within $3\sigma$, but none of the cases reproduce $w_{dm} = 0$ and $w_{de} = -1$. Nevertheless, the comparison with the standard model using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicates that only the non-flat scenario has the potential to be competitive. This suggests that a non-dust-like DM may impact structure formation, while DE could shift toward quintessence fluid. While $\Lambda$CDM remains a strong model, our findings indicate that alternative dark sector models with non-standard EoS could be viable and offer new insights into cosmic evolution.",
Cross submissions,JT de Sitter Gravity as a Model of Coleman-de Luccia Tunneling,"Sidan A,Tom Banks",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We interpret the Euclidean solution of JT de Sitter gravity as the Coleman-de Luccia instanton for the decay of the low-entropy horizon of its static patch solution into either a Big Crunch or an infinite-entropy Lorentzian de Sitter cosmology. As in previous work by one of the authors, the Big Crunch is interpreted as bounding the entropy of the static state. The principle of detailed balance then guarantees it will transition back to a higher entropy causal diamond in the expanding cosmology. We then construct a family of explicit quantum mechanical models and appropriate metastable states, with transition probabilities well approximated by the semi-classical calculations in JT de Sitter gravity.",
Cross submissions,Fullshape power spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model,"Gerardo Morales-Navarrete,Jorge L. Cervantes-Cota",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We make use of the perturbation theory for modified gravity models that we developed in previous works and apply it to construct the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model. First, we study the growth rate, that is a scale dependent quantity, and compare our results with those of the $n=1 $ Hu-Sawcki (HS) model, finding that the Symmetron has a growth quite similar to the HS F6 in the wavenumber interval $0.01 \leq k \leq 0.1 $ and for redshifts where Symmetron model is viable. We also propose a growth parametrization that turns to be a good approximation for the HS and Symmetron models, with a deviation less than $0.6 \%$. To compute the RSD multipoles we employ an expansion of the velocity moments generating function that is suitable for general modified gravity models. Later, we apply the fk-Perturbation Theory (fkPT) approximation to reduce the computation time of nonlinear kernels, to find the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron, and study the differences with HS model. The RSD multipoles of the Symmetron result similar to those of the HS F6 model. Next, we integrate this theory to an MCMC sampler and validate our results by fitting our parameters to EZMocks to recover the parameters that bring the model to GR. We found a similar agreement in the model validation between Symmetron and F6 model, recovering the simulation cosmological parameters, and concluding that our pipeline is ready to make cosmological parameters' inference with real data.",
Cross submissions,Self-gravitating strings and quantum effects in two-dimensional gravity,"Akihiro Ishibashi,Yoshinori Matsuo,Akane Tanaka",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It is expected that when the string coupling is taken to be sufficiently small, a black hole turns into a bound state of self-gravitating fundamental strings. This state would be described by winding strings wrapping around the Euclidean time circle, known as the Horowitz-Polchinski solution. In this paper, we study such a self-gravitating string configuration in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. We first derive an analytic expression of the solution describing a winding string in two-dimensions and investigate in detail the geometry of this solution. Our winding string solution in two dimensions describes the geometry near the surface of the bound state of self-gravitating strings in the large-dimension limit, much like a two-dimensional black hole describes the near horizon geometry of the Schwarzschild black hole in the large-dimension limit. To study quantum effects around self-gravitating strings, we also obtain an analytic solution of winding strings in the RST model. In a similar fashion to the Hartle-Hawking vacuum around a black hole, our string solution in the RST model contains the background radiation, whose temperature is the same as that of the winding strings.",
Cross submissions,Black hole/quantum machine learning correspondence,"Jae-Weon Lee,Zae Young Kim",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore a potential connection between the black hole information paradox and the double descent phenomenon in quantum machine learning. Information retrieval from Hawking radiation can be viewed through the lens of quantum linear regression over black hole microstates, with the Page time corresponding to the interpolation threshold, beyond which test error decreases despite overparameterization. Using the Marchenko-Pastur law, we derive the variance in test error for the quantum linear regression problem and show that the transition across the Page time is associated with a change in the rank structure of subsystems. This observation suggests a conceptual parallel between black hole physics and machine learning that may provide new perspectives for both fields.",
Cross submissions,Distinguishing Monochromatic Signals in LISA and Taiji: Ultralight Dark Matter versus Gravitational Waves,"Heng-Tao Xu,Yue-Hui Yao,Yong Tang,Yue-Liang Wu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is an attractive candidate for cold dark matter, one of the main mysterious components of the Universe. Recent studies suggest that gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers can also detect bosonic ULDM fields, which would produce monochromatic signals resembling those from gravitational waves (GWs). Distinguishing between these potential origins therefore would be essential. In this work, we develop a method to address this challenge for space-based GW interferometers (such as LISA and Taiji) by utilizing the null-response channel (NRC) in interferometric combinations, a channel constructed to have zero response to a specific type of source from a given direction. We find that while the GW NRC remains blind to GWs from a specific direction, it still responds to ULDM, particularly at frequencies above the interferometer's critical frequency. The ULDM NRC exhibits similar behavior. Based on these observations, we outline a test procedure to discriminate between signal origins. Our method provides a new diagnostic tool for analyzing monochromatic signals in space-based GW interferometers, potentially expanding the scientific scope of future missions.",

Cross submissions,Is non-zero equation of state of dark matter favored by DESI DR2?,"Tian-Nuo Li,Yi-Min Zhang,Yan-Hong Yao,Peng-Ju Wu,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The nature of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in modern cosmology. In most cosmological models, dark matter is typically modeled as pressureless dust with an equation of state (EoS) parameter $w_{\rm dm} = 0$. However, there is no fundamental theoretical reason to exclude the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS parameter. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS within the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model, given its simplicity and proven ability to alleviate the Hubble tension. We perform observational constraints by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. From our analysis, we observe that a negative dark matter EoS parameter is preferred in all scenarios. Specifically, the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.00093 \pm 0.00032$, deviating from zero at approximately the $3\sigma$ level. However, this deviation is likely driven by unidentified systematics or inconsistencies in the DESY5 data, with the deviation decreasing to $2\sigma$ when using PantheonPlus data. Meanwhile, a negative $w_{\rm dm}$ would increase the Hubble tension due to the positive degeneracy between $w_{\rm dm}$ and $H_0$. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly preferred over the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model. These analyses illustrate that it is not possible to both support a non-cold dark matter component within the PEDE model and alleviate the Hubble tension simultaneously.",
Cross submissions,Collapse Scenario and Final State of Evaporation for Schwarzschild Black Hole in Dimensionally-Reduced Model of Dilaton Gravity,"Voja Radovanović,Stefan Đorđević",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study a model of (1+1)-dimensional dilaton gravity derived from the four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action by dimensional reduction in a semiclassical approximation including back-reaction. The reduced action involves the cosmological constant and admits black hole solutions; among these, the solutions of interest are the evaporating black holes. We solve the equations of motion perturbatively by demanding that the initial state geometry is a Minkowski space-time. When the infalling matter intersects the space-time boundary, the black hole forms and begins to evaporate. We find that as the black hole evaporates, its horizon shrinks and at a finite space-time point, it meets the singularity and a shockwave occurs. Along this hypersurface, the metric can be continuously matched to a static end-state geometry. This end-state geometry is Minkowski space-time within the first-order of perturbation theory.",
