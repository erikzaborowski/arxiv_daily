New submissions,Adding equatorial-asymmetric effects for spin-precessing binaries into the SEOBNRv5PHM waveform model,"Héctor Estellés,Alessandra Buonanno,Raffi Enficiaud,Cheng Foo,Lorenzo Pompili",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves from spin-precessing binaries exhibit equatorial asymmetries absent in non-precessing systems, leading to net linear momentum emission and contributing to the remnant's recoil. This effect, recently incorporated into only a few waveform models, is crucial for accurate recoil predictions and improved parameter estimation. We present an upgrade to the SEOBNRv5PHM model -- SEOBNRv5PHM_w/asym -- which includes equatorial asymmetric contributions to the l=m<=4 waveform modes in the co-precessing frame. The model combines post-Newtonian inputs with calibrated amplitude and phase corrections and a phenomenological merger-ringdown description, tuned against 1523 quasi-circular spin-precessing numerical relativity waveforms and single-spin precessing test-body plunging-geodesic waveforms. We find that SEOBNRv5PHM_w/asym improves the agreement with NR waveforms across inclinations, with median unfaithfulness reduced by up to 50% compared to SEOBNRv5PHM, and achieves 30-60% lower unfaithfulness than IMRPhenomXPNR and 76-80% lower than TEOBResumS_Dali. The model significantly improves the prediction of the recoil velocity, reducing the median relative error with numerical relativity from 70% to 1%. Bayesian inference on synthetic injections demonstrates improved recovery of spin orientations and mass parameters, and a reanalysis of GW200129 shows a threefold increase in the spin-precessing Bayes factor, highlighting the importance of these effects for interpreting spin-precessing events.",
New submissions,Waging a Campaign: Results from an Injection-Recovery Study involving 35 numerical Relativity Simulations and three Waveform Models,"Sarp Akçay,Charlie Hoy,Jake Mac Uilliam",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present Bayesian inference results from an extensive injection-recovery campaign to test the validity of three state of the art quasicircular gravitational waveform models: \textsc{SEOBNRv5PHM}, \textsc{IMRPhenomTPHM}, \textsc{IMRPhenomXPHM}, the latter with the \textsc{SpinTaylorT4} implementation for its precession dynamics. We analyze 35 strongly precessing binary black hole numerical relativity simulations with all available harmonic content. Ten simulations have a mass ratio of $4:1$ and five, mass ratio of $8:1$. Overall, we find that \textsc{SEOBNRv5PHM} is the most consistent model to numerical relativity, with the majority of true source properties lying within the inferred 90\% credible interval. However, we find that none of the models can reliably infer the true source properties for binaries with mass ratio $8:1$ systems. We additionally conduct inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) consistency tests to determine if our chosen state of the art waveform models infer consistent properties when analysing only the inspiral (low frequency) and ringdown (high frequency) portions of the signal. For the simulations considered in this work, we find that the IMR consistency test depends on the frequency that separates the inspiral and ringdown regimes. For two sensible choices of the cutoff frequency, we report that \textsc{IMRPhenomXPHM} can produce false GR deviations. Meanwhile, we find that \textsc{IMRPhenomTPHM} is the most reliable model under the IMR consistency test. Finally, we re-analyze the same 35 simulations, but this time we incorporate model accuracy into our Bayesian inference. Consistent with the work in Hoy et al. 2024 [arXiv:2409.19404], we find this approach generally yields more accurate inferred properties for binary black holes with less biases compared to methods that combine model-dependent posterior distributions based on their evidence, or with equal weight.",
New submissions,Compact Cauchy horizons admit constant surface gravity,"Raymond A. Hounnonkpe,Ettore Minguzzi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"We prove that in any spacetime dimension and under the dominant energy condition, every totally geodesic connected smooth compact null hypersurface (hence every compact Cauchy horizon) admits a smooth lightlike tangent vector field of constant surface gravity. That is, we solve the open degenerate case by showing that, if there is a complete generator, then there exists a smooth future-directed geodesic lightlike tangent field. The result can be stated as an existence result for a particular cohomological equation. The proof uses elements of ergodic theory, Hodge theory and Riemannian flow theory.",
New submissions,Hair imprints of the gravitational decoupling and hairy black hole spectroscopy,"V. F. Guimarães,R. T. Cavalcanti,R. da Rocha",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Hairy black holes by gravitational decoupling (GD) are probed to derive the gravitational waveform produced by perturbation theory applied to these compact objects. Using the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations governing the metric perturbations and applying a higher-order WKB method, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) are computed and discussed. Compared to the QNMs produced in the ringdown phase of Reissner-Nordström black hole solutions, it yields a clear physical signature of primary hair imprinting the hairy GD black hole gravitational waveforms.",
New submissions,Laboratory Frame Representation for General High-Frequency Gravitational Waveforms,"Lars Fischer,Tom Krokotsch,Gudrid Moortgat-Pick",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Next-generation gravitational wave (GW) experiments will explore higher frequency ranges, where GW wavelengths approach the size of the detector itself. In this regime, GWs may be detected not just through the well-known mechanical deformation by tidal forces but also via induced effective currents in electromagnetic background fields. However, the calculation of this signal requires the GW metric in laboratory coordinates of the detector, and an accurate transformation to all orders into this frame is necessary. In this work, we derive a closed-form expression for the metric transformation of general chirp-like waveforms expressed in terms of the transverse-traceless GW metric, its integral, and its derivative. For more complex signals, where analytical integration is impractical, we provide an efficient approximation based on Taylor expansions of the retarded time to coalescence. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied to calculate the signal response of a large class of detectors. Our approach provides essential tools for designing and interpreting high-frequency GW experiments that search for compact object mergers at MHz to GHz frequencies beyond the long-wavelength limit.",
New submissions,Emergent Lorentzian Geometries from Spin-Foams and Group Field Theories,Alexander F. Jercher,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"The emergence of Lorentzian geometries in spin-foams and group field theories is investigated. The spectral dimension of periodic Euclidean spin-foam frusta is studied. At large scales, the spectral dimension is generically four. At lower scales, a non-trivial flow of the spectral dimension is observed, sensitive to quantum effects, curvature induced oscillations and the parameters of the theory. The removal of numerical cutoffs and a thermodynamic limit is discussed, suggesting a phase transition from zero to four large-scale dimensions. Lorentzian Regge calculus for (3+1) cosmology, modelled with Lorentzian 4-frusta, coupled to a massless free scalar field is studied. It is shown that causal regularity, solutions to the Regge equations and a continuum limit only exist if the cells connecting neighboring slices are timelike. The dynamics can be expressed relationally only in the small deficit angle limit. Effective (2+1) spin-foam cosmology with a minimally coupled massive scalar field is investigated. The scalar field mass is shown to ensure convergence of the path integral. The classicality of expectation values is shown to be intimately connected to causal regularity and the path integral measure. A causal completion of the Barrett-Crane group field theory model is developed. Its amplitudes are explicitly computed in spin representation using methods from integral geometry. A Landau-Ginzburg analysis is applied to the complete Barrett-Crane (BC) group field theory model. It is shown that mean-field theory is generically self-consistent, and that timelike faces do not contribute to the critical behavior. Employing the complete BC model, a physical Lorentzian reference frame is coupled, and scalar cosmological perturbations are extracted from entangled GFT coherent states. The dynamics of these perturbations are shown to agree with classical results up to quantum corrections.",
New submissions,Dimension of the isometry group in type N vacuum solutions: an IDEAL approach,"Juan Antonio Sáez,Salvador Mengual,Joan Josep Ferrando",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The necessary and sufficient conditions for a type N vacuum solution (with cosmological constant) to admit a group of isometries of dimension $r$ are given in terms of the invariant concomitants of the Weyl tensor. This study requires defining several invariant classes, and for each class, the conditions that determine the dimension are given. Thus, an IDEAL (Intrinsic, Deductive, Explicit and ALgorithmic) characterisation of these spacetimes follows. Some examples show that our algorithmic results can easily be implemented on the \textit{xAct Mathematica} suite of packages. The relation between our classes and already known families of solutions of Einstein equations is outlined.",
New submissions,Many phases in a hairy box in three dimensions,Shoichiro Miyashita,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, I investigate gravitational thermodynamics of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar system in three dimensions without a cosmological constant. In the previous work by Krishnan,Shekhar, and Bala Subramanian (Nucl. Phys. B 958 (2020) 115115 [33]), it was argued that this system has no BH saddles, but has only empty (flat space) saddles and boson star saddles. It was then concluded that the structure of the thermodynamic phase space is much simpler than in the higher dimensional cases. I will show that, in addition to the known boson star and empty saddles, three more types of saddles exist in this system: the BG saddle, its hairy generalization, and a novel configuration called the boson star-PL saddle. As a result, the structure is richer than one might naively expect and is very similar to the higher dimensional ones.",
Cross submissions,Predicting wide binaries and deviations from standard gravity using machine learning algorithms,"Amoy Ashesh,Harsimran Kaur,Sandeep Aashish",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a machine learning (ML) framework for the detection of wide binary star systems and the identification of deviations from standard gravity using Gaia DR3 data. By training supervised ML models on established wide binary catalogues, we efficiently classify wide binaries and employ clustering and nearest neighbour search to pair candidate systems. We recast the problem of identifying systematic deviations from standard gravity as a supervised anomaly detection. Our approach incorporates data preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE, correlation analysis, and PCA, and achieves high accuracy and recall in both binary classification and anomaly detection tasks. The resulting publicly available code enables rapid, scalable, and customizable analysis of wide binaries and gravitational anomalies, complementing conventional analyses and providing a valuable resource for future astrophysical studies.",
Cross submissions,Fermionic S-matrix and cosmological correlators: T-violation at O(H),"Aman Goyal,Aneek Jana,Swapnanil Mandal,Aninda Sinha",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We study the Bunch-Davies (BD) and Unruh-de Witt (UdW) de Sitter S-matrices in the presence of spin-$1/2$ fermions. Building on recent work, this enables us to correlate the de Sitter S-matrix with cosmological correlators. We consider a finite-time version of the UdW S-matrix to study $O(H)$ corrections to some typical particle physics processes such as beta decay. Owing to the lack of time-reversal symmetry in the expanding Poincaré patch, we find signatures of intrinsic T-violation in polarized beta decay. The observable we study begins at $O(H)$. The possibility of T-violation was examined theoretically in the 1950's by Jackson, Treiman, and Wyld in flat space and has been probed more recently in the emiT experiment, with the purpose of examining fundamental T-violation coming from additional interactions in the Lagrangian. Our analysis places a lower bound on the intrinsic T-violation in the expanding Poincaré patch. At $O(H)$, we find both energy conserving and energy non-conserving contributions. Surprisingly, the energy-violating piece, in principle, can give large T-violation at fine-tuned values of the kinematical variables.",
Cross submissions,Bounds on QCA Lattice Spacing from Data on Lorentz Violation,"Leonard Mlodinow,Todd A. Brun",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent work has demonstrated that discrete quantum walks, when extended to quantum cellular automata (QCA), can, in the continuum limit, reproduce relativistic wave equations and quantum field theories (QFTs), including free quantum electrodynamics (QED). This QCA/QFT correspondence bridges quantum information processing and high-energy physics, raising fundamental questions about the nature of spacetime: whether it is the continuum QFT or the discrete QCA that is fundamental. For while Lorentz invariance appears robust experimentally, it may only approximate a deeper discrete structure, particularly at Planck-scale energies. This high-energy Lorentz violation is potentially observable either through cumulative effects over cosmic distances or via small deviations at accessible energies. In this paper, we analyze the QCA corresponding to QED and show that it implies both a deviation from the speed of light and spatial anisotropies. Using current experimental and astrophysical constraints, we place upper bounds on the QCA lattice spacing, providing insight into the plausibility of a fundamentally discrete spacetime.",
Cross submissions,Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets,Slava G. Turyshev,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Space Physics (physics.space-ph),"We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10x10 pixel map of a 1 R_Earth world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon collection sufficient for SNR >= 5 per ""micro-pixel"". We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based extremely large telescopes with extreme adaptive optics; (5) pupil-densified ""hypertelescopes""; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); and (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals - exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization - each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the astrometric resolution and photon-budget thresholds needed to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in situ platform delivered to <= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits - but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens - providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once a spacecraft reaches >=550 AU - remains the only near-term, scientifically and technologically viable means to acquire true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.",
Cross submissions,Anomalous Bulk Current in Quantum Hall Systems with an Expanding Edge,"Yuuki Sugiyama,Tokiro Numasawa",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Understanding topological phases of matter is essential for advancing both the fundamental theory and practical applications of condensed matter physics. Recently, a theoretical framework for a quantum Hall system with an expanding edge state was proposed [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 105}, 105009 (2022)], revealing the existence of an energy flux analogous to Hawking radiation on the edge. Motivated by this work, we extend the analysis to a model of a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime that includes both the bulk and edge regions. Due to the presence of bulk and edges, we demonstrate that the covariant form of the gravitational anomaly appears on the edge via the anomaly-inflow mechanism. Then, we investigate the energy flux on the edge from the viewpoint of gravitational anomalies, such as covariant gravitational and Weyl anomalies. We also find that, due to the conservation of energy and momentum in the entire system, the presence of anomalous currents on the expanding edge induces non-trivial currents in the bulk originating from the expansion of the edge.",
Cross submissions,Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter,"Yupeng Yang,Qianyong Li,Jiali Hao,Xiujuan Li",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$, are $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.",
Cross submissions,Stretched Horizon Dissipation and the Fate of Echoes,Seiji Terashima,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We examine the dissipation of infalling particles near black holes under the assumption that the equivalence principle breaks down at the stretched horizon. This violation allows partial reflection of particles just outside the event horizon, as suggested by models such as the fuzzball and firewall proposals. We show that scattering with blue-shifted Hawking radiation leads to moderate dissipation when the particle energy is comparable to the Hawking temperature. The decay rate is independent of the Planck mass, and therefore gravitational wave echoes-arising from such partial reflection-may survive despite the presence of quantum gravitational effects. Our result is universal and does not rely on the detailed microphysics of the horizon.",
Cross submissions,Norm of the no-boundary state,"Jordan Cotler,Kristan Jensen",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider Einstein gravity with positive cosmological constant coupled to matter in an asymptotically de Sitter universe with sphere boundary at timelike infinity. In this setting we show that, to one-loop order and at late time, the norm of the no-boundary state vanishes, going as $ e^{S_0} \frac{Z S_0^{-d(d+1)/4}}{\text{vol}(SO(d,1))}$ with $S_0$ the tree-level entropy of the static patch, $d$ the spacetime dimension, and $Z$ non-negative. While we expect a non-zero norm to arise at two loops, the presence of an observer already stabilizes it to a large, finite value at one loop.",
Cross submissions,Anomalous Energy Injection in Turbulent Neutron Star Cores,"Anirudh Sivakumar,Pankaj Kumar Mishra,Ahmad A. Hujeirat,Paulsamy Muruganandam",Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. Using a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate with phenomenological damping and a pinning potential to mimic the crust, we model the dynamics underlying these events. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which sustains turbulent fluctuations in pulsar glitches. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. These findings provide a robust analogy for neutron star glitch phenomena and offer new insights into turbulence in extreme astrophysical environments.",
Cross submissions,Radiated Angular Momentum from Spinning Black Hole Scattering Trajectories,"Gustav Mogull,Jan Plefka,Kathrin Stoldt",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Using the worldline quantum field theory approach we derive solutions to the equations of motion for spinning massive bodies up to quadratic order in spins. At leading post-Minkowskian (PM) order these trajectories are obtained in the time domain, and at sub-leading order in the frequency domain. Our approach incorporates diagrammatic techniques and modern Feynman integration technologies, and includes a new family of loop integrals different to those seen in asymptotic PM calculations. Our results provide a new mechanism for computing the radiated angular momentum involved in gravitational scattering, which we reproduce at 2PM order up to linear spins. We have established a framework for computing higher-order effects to further extend the high-precision frontier in analytical gravitational wave physics, and push predictions for the radiated angular momentum to higher perturbative orders.",
Cross submissions,Local-in-Time Conservative Binary Dynamics at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and First Self-Force Orders,"Christoph Dlapa,Gregor Kälin,Zhengwen Liu,Rafael A. Porto",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We report the local-in-time conservative dynamics of nonspinning binary systems at fifth Post-Minkowskian (5PM) and first self-force (1SF) orders. This follows from an explicit calculation of the 5PM/1SF nonlocal-in-time tail-type contribution to the deflection angle via worldline effective field theory techniques. Proceeding as in [2403.04853], we subtract the nonlocal tail terms from the result in [2403.07781] and reconstruct a local-in-time Hamiltonian in isotropic gauge -- valid for generic orbits. For completeness, we reinstate the nonlocal terms relevant for elliptic-like motion up to 6PN/1SF in a small-eccentricity expansion. Via the connection between the (source) energy flux in [2210.05541] and tail effects, we also derive the SF-exact logarithmic-dependent part of the full 5PM bound Hamiltonian. Our results provide the most accurate description to date of the dynamics of bound compact objects within the framework of relativistic scattering computations.",
