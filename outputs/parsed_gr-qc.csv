New submissions,Charged particle dynamics in singular spacetimes: hydrogenic mapping and curvature-corrected thermodynamics,"Abdullah Guvendi,Semra Gurtas Dogan,Omar Mustafa,Hassan Hassanabadi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We analyze the dynamics of charged test particles in a singular, horizonless spacetime arising as the massless limit of a charged wormhole in the Einstein--Maxwell--Scalar framework. The geometry, sustained solely by an electric charge \(Q\), features an infinite sequence of curvature singularity shells, with the outermost at \(r_\ast = \frac{2|Q|}{\pi}\) acting as a hard boundary for nonradial motion, while radial trajectories can access it depending on the particle's charge-to-mass ratio \(\frac{|q|}{m}\). Exploiting exact first integrals, we construct the effective potential and obtain circular orbit radii, radial epicyclic frequencies, and azimuthal precession rates. In the weak-field limit (\(r \gg |Q|\)), the motion reduces to a Coulombic system with small curvature-induced retrograde precession. At large radii, the dynamics maps to a hydrogenic system, with curvature corrections inducing perturbative energy shifts. Approaching \(r_\ast\), the potential diverges, producing hard-wall confinement. Curvature corrections also modify the canonical thermodynamics, raising energies and slightly altering entropy and heat capacity. Our results characterize the transition from Newtonian-like orbits to strongly confined, curvature-dominated dynamics.",
New submissions,"Spectral instability of horizonless compact objects within astrophysical environments: The ""exotic'' elephant and the flea","Kyriakos Destounis,Mateus Malato Corrêa,Caio F. B. Macedo,Rodrigo Panosso Macedo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose into ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.",
New submissions,Spontaneous excitation of a centripetally accelerated atom coupled to electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a reflecting boundary,"Yan Peng,Jiawei Hu,Hongwei Yu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We investigate the rate of change of the mean atomic energy for centripetally accelerated atoms interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a reflecting boundary, using the Dalibard-Dupont-Roc-Cohen-Tannoudji formalism. The distinct contributions from vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction are analyzed separately. Our results reveal that, when the centripetal acceleration significantly exceeds the characteristic acceleration set by the atomic transition frequency, vacuum fluctuations dominates over radiation reaction, irrespective of the atom-boundary distance and the atomic polarization. In the near-zone regime, where the atom-boundary distance is much smaller than both the characteristic length associated with the acceleration and the transition wavelength of the atom, the boundary introduces substantial corrections to the rate of change of the mean atomic energy. These corrections are comparable in magnitude to those in free space and exhibit strong dependence on the atomic polarization. Remarkably, in the intermediate and far regions, contributions stemming from the combined effects of the boundary and acceleration can become the leading and subleading terms, respectively. An acceleration-independent term also arises from their interplay. These findings highlight the significant interplay between acceleration and the presence of a boundary in shaping atomic radiative properties and may have potential implications for experimentally probing the circular Unruh effect.",
New submissions,Universal Relations of Anisotropic Dark Energy Stars and Gravitational-Wave Constraints,"O. P. Jyothilakshmi,V. Sreekanth",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We investigate, for the first time, universal relations for anisotropic dark energy stars. The stars are modeled with the modified Chaplygin equation of state and the Bowers-Liang prescription for anisotropy, and their global properties and $f$-mode frequencies are computed using the modified relativistic Hartle-Thorne slow rotation and Cowling approximations. We find that relations among moment of inertia, tidal deformability, quadrupole moment and $f$-mode frequency exhibit universality, with deviations limited to $1-10\%$, in close agreement with other compact star models. Using tidal deformability constraints from GW170817 and GW190814, we obtain astrophysical limits on canonical properties of dark energy stars. For positive anisotropy strength, the radius of a $1.4M_\odot$ star is constrained to $R_{1.4}=8.93^{1.88}_{1.40}$ km (GW170817) and $10.92^{+0.71}_{-0.54}$ km (GW190814), consistent with observational bounds. The corresponding $f$-mode frequencies are constrained to $3.257^{+0.450}_{-0.537}$ kHz and $2.692^{+0.137}_{-0.157}$ kHz. Further, applying Pearson correlation analysis for the first time to anisotropic compact stars, we obtained the coefficients between various stellar attributes of dark energy stars and we show that the Chaplygin parameter $B$ correlates strongly with the $f$-mode frequency, with positive anisotropy strengthening while negative anisotropy weakening the correlation strength. These results establish that universal relations extend to anisotropic dark energy stars and can be directly tested with present and future gravitational-wave observations.",
New submissions,Cosmological viability of anisotropic inflation in Thurston spacetimes,"Devika J.S.,Tanay Gupta,Sukanta Panda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The introduction of anisotropy into large scale geometry of the universe has led to the development of Thurston spacetimes possessing an inherent anisotropic curvature in them. Studies related to these anisotropic spacetimes have revealed how they could explain the evolutionary dynamics and light propagation in the universe. Here, we consider these spacetimes under the inflationary epoch to examine whether we could address the possibility of anisotropic inflation in the universe. Researches have proposed inflationary models where a vector field coupled to the inflaton was found violating the cosmic no-hair theorem for the anisotropic Bianchi type I spacetime through the existence of a stable anisotropically inflationary fixed point. Lately, this study was extended to axisymmetric spacetimes of Bianchi type II, III and the Kantowski-Sachs metric and it was inferred that the entire family of spacetimes was attracted to the anisotropic Bianchi I fixed point. By fabricating Thurston spacetimes as inflationary models with its shear sourced by a vector field, we perform dynamical stability and phase space analyses to confer the feasibility of anisotropic inflation. The results obtained for the considered set of Thurston geometries showed the presence and convergence to a unique, stable inflationary fixed point which was found to be similar to those obtained in Bianchi spacetimes, thereby indicating the cosmological viability of inflation with anisotropic hair.",
New submissions,Generalized accelerating Kerr-Newman-NUT-de Sitter black holes,Changjun Gao,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We obtain rotating black hole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations with the cosmological constant. There are eight parameters in the solutions. They are the physical mass $M$, the electric charge $Q$, the specific angular momentum $a$, the acceleration $\alpha$, the cosmological constant $\lambda$ and other three parameters, $S_1\;, S_2$ and $S_3$. We show that $S_3$ and $S_1$ are actually the well-known NUT charge and the rescaled parameter $C$, respectively, for the Kerr-NUT spacetime. As for $S_2$, it is a new parameter although it has the same physical meaning of $C$ in the weak field limit. In the case of static limit, $S_2$ describes a conical defect along the axis of revolution, which corresponds to a cosmic string of tension. Therefore, the solutions extend the accelerating Kerr-Newman-NUT-de Sitter spacetime.",
New submissions,Dynamics of Interacting Murnaghan-Equation-of-State Fluids with Global Monopole and Nonlinear Power-Yang-Mills Hair in Critical-Dimension AdS Black Holes,"Yassine Sekhmani,Sunil Kumar Maurya,Javlon Rayimbaev,Mohamed Altanji,Inomjon Ibragimov,Alexandre Landry,Sokhibjan Muminov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We construct and analyze a novel family of exact higher-dimensional black hole solutions in Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field multiplet supporting a global monopole and a surrounding anisotropic ''scalar gas'' whose stress-energy obeys a generalized Murnaghan equation of state. By adopting the Wu-Yang magnetic ansatz for the non-Abelian sector and enforcing the physically motivated radial condition $p_r=-\rho$, the field equations admit closed-form expressions for the matter density and a single-function lapse $F(r)$ expressed in terms of elementary and Gauss hypergeometric functions. The Murnaghan fluid interpolates between a non-linear core and an effective vacuum at a large radius, producing a backreaction encoded by parameters that control the stiffness and scalar-backreaction scale. We perform a systematic survey of classical energy condition, identifying regions of parameter space where the null energy condition/dominant energy condition holds while the strong energy condition is generically violated (phantom-like behavior), and examine curvature invariants to demonstrate that the solutions possess a central curvature singularity for $n>3$. Thermodynamic properties are derived in the extended phase space: explicit formulas for the Hawking temperature, entropy, conjugate potentials, and a generalized Smarr relation are obtained; the heat capacity exhibits divergencies and sign changes that mark local stability boundaries and second-order phase transitions. Varying the Yang-Mills charge, the nonlinearity index, the monopole coupling, and the Murnaghan parameters generates a rich phase behavior structure and topology changes in the defect ($\varphi$-Duan) map. The results underscore the manner in which gauge nonlinearity, topological defects, and dual-polytropic matter collaboratively transform BH thermodynamics and the topology of phase spaces.",
New submissions,Null geodesics and shadows of slowly rotating wormholes immersed in dark matter halos,"Abdelghani Errehymy,Abdullah Guvendi,Semra Gurtas Dogan,Omar Mustafa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study slowly rotating traversable wormholes embedded in realistic galactic dark matter halos, including Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Bose-Einstein Condensate (Thomas-Fermi, TF), and pseudo-isothermal (PI) profiles. Using the Teo-type rotating wormhole metric, we construct shape functions from halo density distributions and analyze the resulting geometrical properties, such as throat structure, flaring-out conditions, and violations of the null energy condition. We examine null geodesics, effective potentials, photon spheres, and Lense-Thirring (LT) precession, highlighting differences between cuspy and cored halo models. Finally, we calculate wormhole shadows, observing that cuspy NFW halos tend to produce smaller, asymmetric shadows, while cored TF and PI halos yield smoother, nearly circular silhouettes. The findings provide a theoretical characterization of photon dynamics and shadow morphology in wormholes embedded within different dark matter environments.",
New submissions,Constraints on Kalb-Ramond Gravity from EHT Observations of Rotating Black Holes in Traceless Conformal Electrodynamics,"Yassine Sekhmani,Kuantay Boshkayev,Mustapha Azreg-Aïnou,Sunil K. Maurya,Mohamed Altanji,Ainur Urazalina",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present a phenomenological study of rotating, charged black holes in Einstein gravity coupled to a traceless (conformal) matter sector formed by ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics and a Kalb-Ramond two-form that spontaneously breaks local Lorentz symmetry. Starting from a family of obtained static, Schwarzschild-like solutions with a traceless Kalb-Ramond sector, we construct the stationary, axisymmetric counterpart via the Newman-Janis algorithm. The resulting Newman-Kerr-like metric depends on four intrinsic parameters: the electric charge $Q$, the ModMax nonlinearity $\gamma$, the Lorentz-violation amplitude $\ell$ and the spin $a$. We analyze horizon structure and separatrices in parameter space, derive the null geodesic equations and obtain the photon capture boundary that defines the black hole shadow. Using ray-tracing, we compute shadow silhouettes and a suite of shadow observables (areal radius, characteristic radius $R_s$, distortion $\delta$, oblateness $D$) and show how $\gamma$ and $\ell$ produce qualitatively distinct effects: $\gamma$ acts as a screening factor for the electromagnetic imprint, while $\ell$ introduces angular-dependent metric rescalings that deform shadow shape beyond simple size rescaling. We confront model predictions with EHT angular-radius measurements for M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$ and derive conservative bounds on the combinations of $(Q,\gamma,\ell,a)$. Our results identify an effective charge combination $Q_{\rm eff}\simeq e^{-\gamma}Q^{2}/(1-\ell)^{2}$ and demonstrate that modest $Q_{\rm eff}$ remains compatible with current EHT images while large $Q_{\rm eff}$ is progressively disfavored.",
New submissions,Probing Kalb-Ramond field with extreme mass ratio inspirals,"Zhong-Wu Xia,Huajie Gong,Qiyuan Pan,Jiliang Jing",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are emerging as precision laboratories for testing the gravity beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) effect induced by the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field on the gravitational waveforms from the EMRI system. We observe that the LSB parameter $l$ appears in the leading order for the corrections of energy and angular momentum fluxes, and as $|l|$ increases, the differences in EMRI waveforms between the KR black hole and Schwarzschild black hole become more pronounced. We note that the LSB effect becomes detectable by LISA for values of $|l|\sim 10^{-6}$ with a one-year observation period. Furthermore, we use the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approach for the parameter estimation and find the detection error for $l$ can be constrained to $\Delta l \sim 10^{-5}$ at $\mathrm{SNR} = 20$, demonstrating the potential of space-based gravitational wave detectors to rigorously test the KR field.",
New submissions,Exact quasinormal modes in Grumiller spacetime,"Li-Qin Mi,Zhong-Heng Li",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The Grumiller metric is an effective model for gravity at large distances and plays a significant role in constructing galactic models and explaining dark matter. Here, in Grumiller spacetime, we analytically compute the quasinormal-mode frequencies and wave functions for massless particles with spin $\leq 2$ by introducing a new transformation relation. We find that the quasinormal-mode frequencies are identical for different bosons sharing the same quantum number $N$, and similarly for different fermions. However, the frequencies of bosons and fermions never coincide. Moreover, for a given spin state, the corresponding particles exhibit an $(n + 1)$-fold degeneracy. These results provide a theoretical basis for simulating particle waves with identical statistical properties.",
New submissions,Dynamics of the $N$-body system in energy-momentum squared gravity: II. Existence of a Self-Acceleration,Elham Nazari,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the post-Newtonian (PN) dynamics of energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG), with particular emphasis on the possibility of self-acceleration in $N$-body systems. A central challenge in matter-type modified gravity theories, including EMSG, is the non-vanishing divergence of the energy-momentum tensor, arising from the nonminimal interaction between the standard and modified matter fields. This feature can, in principle, influence the $N$-body dynamics. In our previous work [1], its effects on the external-dependent part of the motion were studied in an EMSG class known as quadratic-EMSG. Here, we extend the analysis to the internal-structure-dependent contributions, namely self-acceleration. To this end, we relax the reflection-symmetric assumption adopted in [1] and derive the complete equations of motion for a self-gravitating body in an $N$-body system up to the first PN order. By introducing a suitable expression for the center-of-mass acceleration and employing virial identities, including one newly emerging within the quadratic-EMSG framework, it is shown that self-acceleration vanishes. Furthermore, we establish a PN integral conservation law for the total momentum, demonstrating that, as in general relativity (GR), EMSG admits a conserved linear momentum compatible with the absence of self-acceleration. Binary pulsar experiments provide stringent bounds on self-acceleration, and our analysis shows that, within the present level of accuracy, EMSG is consistent with these constraints. Therefore, the theory remains viable in the strong-gravity regime probed by binary pulsars.",
New submissions,Gravitational properties of Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter halos,"Francisco S.N. Lobo,Tiberiu Harko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent studies suggest that dark matter could take the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a possibility motivated by anomalies in galactic rotation curves and the missing mass problem in galaxy clusters. We investigate the astrophysical properties of BEC dark matter halos and their potential observational signatures distinguishing them from alternative models. In this framework, dark matter behaves as a self-gravitating Newtonian fluid with a polytropic equation of state of index $n=1$. We derive analytic expressions for the mass distribution, gravitational potential, and dynamical profiles such as the density slope and tangential velocity. The lensing behavior of BEC halos is analyzed, yielding a general series representation of the projected surface density that enables precise predictions for deflection angles, lensing potentials, and magnifications. Finally, halo equilibrium and stability are examined via the scalar and tensor virial theorems, leading to perturbation equations that describe their response to small disturbances. Together, these results provide a unified framework linking the microscopic physics of condensate dark matter to macroscopic halo observables.",
New submissions,Is the $Λ$CDM Model in Crisis?,"Himanshu Chaudhary,Salvatore Capozziello,Subhrat Praharaj,Shibesh Kumar Jas Pacif,G. Mustafa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy challenging the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy models are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, and BA, along with non-flat cosmologies accounting for potential spatial curvature. Our analysis supports a flat Universe ($\Omega_k \approx 0$). Using the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, we analyze data from BAO of DESI DR2, Type Ia Supernovae, and CMB to constrain model parameters. We find strong evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, with deviations from $\Lambda$CDM favoring dynamical dark energy consistent with the Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 > -1$, $\omega_a < 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a < -1$). We also derive upper bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ from CMB + DESI DR2. For $\Lambda$CDM we find $\sum m_\nu < 0.066~\text{eV}$, while for $\omega$CDM it is $\sum m_\nu < 0.075~\text{eV}$. In o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM the limits are $\sum m_\nu < 0.263~\text{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu < 0.520~\text{eV}$, respectively. For other models, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE, the upper limits range from $< 0.043~\text{eV}$ to $< 0.127~\text{eV}$. Constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, remain consistent with the standard value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ for all models. Bayesian evidence shows that combining DES-SN5Y and Union3 SNe Ia with CMB + DESI DR2 reveals deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, while no model reaches the $5\sigma$ threshold, some show $> 3\sigma$ tensions with DES-SN5YR or Union3, hinting at cracks in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.",
New submissions,"Gravitational baryogenesis in $f(T,L_m)$ gravity","Daniel F.P. Cruz,David S. Pereira,Francisco S.N. Lobo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.",
New submissions,non-Singular Spacetime Cores via Gravitational Evanescence of Collapsing Matter,Antonio Panassiti,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Modified Einstein's equations implementing both an energy-dependent Newtonian and cosmological constant can be obtained via a modified action characterised by a non-minimal gravity-matter coupling. We show how different dynamics for the high energy regime - that nevertheless have in common the vanishing of the Newton constant - result in models of gravitational collapse which source the formation of non-singular geometries with different types of asymptotic core: de Sitter, Minkowski, and with ""steep pressure"". As we categorise their defining properties, one feature, which we prove to be actually independent of both the specific form of the non-minimal coupling and the equation of state of the collapsing fluid, stands out: the formation of a geometry with Minkowski core occurs only if the Newton constant, before finally vanishing, assumes negative values.",
New submissions,Black-hole ringdown analysis with inspiral-merger informed templates and limitations of classical spectroscopy,"Koustav Chandra,Juan Calderón Bustillo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The ringdown of a perturbed black hole consists of a superposition of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), with complex frequencies determined by the black hole's mass and spin, while phases and amplitudes depend on binary parameters. Traditional semi-agnostic ringdown analyses ignore the remnant's binary-merger origin, assuming instead generic perturbations. This can lead to an unphysical number of free parameters and usage of priors inconsistent with those imposed by full inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) analysis. Here we revisit an alternative approach, first proposed in Calderón Bustillo et al. 2021, in which ringdowns are modeled using the post-merger portion of full IMR waveform models. This naturally includes all QNMs without adding extra degrees of freedom and ties priors to binary parameters. We analyze the signal GW150914 with the post-merger portion of the IMR surrogate model NRSur7dq4, finding decisive evidence for the no-hair theorem with a Bayes factor $>650:1$ or $>99.8$% probability, compared to only $3:1$ from semi-agnostic spectroscopy, consistent with previous work. We also find modest evidence ($\simeq 5:1$) for the $(\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)$ overtone and none for higher modes. Using simulated signals, we validate our formalism by showing accurate recovery of remnant properties. Next, by analysing simulated signals with post-merger signal-to-noise ratios up to 100, we show that classical spectroscopy based on overtone detection alone cannot provide strong no-hair tests. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-orthogonality of QNMs makes the inferred mode content strongly model-dependent, leading to multiple inconsistent interpretations that are equally well-supported by the data. We briefly discuss potential implications for recent events, such as GW231123 and GW250114.",
New submissions,Destroying the Kerr Newman MOG Black hole with Scalar Test Field,"Waqar Ahmad,Abdul Rehman Kashif,Ayyesha K. Ahmed",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We test the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) for the Kerr-Newman-modified gravity black hole (KN-MOG-BH) by interacting scalar test fields with the KN-MOG-BH. Neglecting backreaction effects, we first show that the scalar test fields with frequencies just above the superradiance threshold can overspin both extremal and nearly extremal KN-MOG-BHs, leading to the formation of naked singularities. Moreover, test fields can continuously push nearly extremal KN-MOG-BHs toward their extremal limit. Next, we incorporate backreaction effects, assuming that the event horizon's angular velocity rises prior to the test field's absorption. We show that backreaction prevents overspinning in the extremal KN-MOG-BH, whereas in the nearly extremal case, it fails to stop the BH from being overspun.",
New submissions,Quantum Noise Reduction in the Space-based Gravitational Wave Antenna DECIGO Using Optical Springs and Homodyne Detection scheme,"Kenji Tsuji,Tomohiro Ishikawa,Kentaro Komori,Yutaro Enomoto,Yuta Michimura,Kurumi Umemura,Shoki Iwaguchi,Keiko Kokeyama,Seiji Kawamura",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO) is a planned space-based, next-generation gravitational wave detector aimed at observing primordial gravitational waves originating form cosmic inflation. This work focuses on reducing the quantum noise, in the instrument's observation band of 0.1 to 10 Hz, by employing optical springs and a homodyne detection scheme. Although detuning 1000\,km long arm cavities was previously considered ineffective due to quantum state degradation from diffraction losses, we revisit this problem by formulating a new, rigorous model for quantum state of light by accounting for the vacuum state mixing as a result of diffraction losses. This work shows that high sensitivities can be achieved by employing optimal configurations of optical springs and homodyne detection schemes even with diffraction losses. These improvements alone are still not sufficient to achieve sensitivities to detect primordial gravitational waves as other technical noises limit further improvement.",
New submissions,Enhanced Gravitational Effects of Radiation and Cosmological Implications,"Hemza Azri,Kemal Gültekin,Adrian K. E. Tee",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"In the momentarily comoving frame of a cosmological fluid, the determinant of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) is highly sensitive to its pressure. This component is significant during radiation-dominated epochs, and becomes naturally negligible as the universe transitions to the matter-dominated era. Here, we investigate the cosmological consequences of gravity sourced by the determinant of the EMT. Unlike Azri and Nasri, Phys. Lett. B 836, 137626 (2023), we consider the most general case in which the second derivative of the perfect-fluid Lagrangian does not vanish. We derive the gravitational field equations for the general power-law case and examine the cosmological implications of the scale-independent model characterized by dimensionless couplings to photons and neutrinos. We show that, unlike various theories based on the EMT, the present setup, which leads to an enhanced gravitational effects of radiation, does not alter the time evolution of the energy density of particle species. Furthermore, we confront the model with the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis, and discuss its potential to alleviate the Hubble tension by reducing the sound horizon. The radiation-gravity couplings we propose here are expected to yield testable cosmological and astrophysical signatures, probing whether gravity distinguishes between relativistic and nonrelativistic species in the early universe.",
New submissions,Exact Taub-NUT-like Black Holes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity: their thermodynamics and thermodynamic topology,"Mustapha Azreg-Aïnou,Yassine Sekhmani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We determine exact analytic three-parameter expressions for the non-rotating metric, describing a Taub-NUT-like black hole (BH), and its associated bumblebee field that are solutions to the Einstein-bumblebee gravity. We construct a consistence thermodynamics for the Taub-NUT-like BH and determine its thermodynamic topological class. The Lorentz symmetry breaking affects the mass and temperature of the BH but does not its thermodynamic topological classification.",
New submissions,Binary black hole merger in the extreme mass ratio limit: a multipolar analysis of the inclined orbit case,"Luca Nagni,Alessandro Nagar,Rossella Gamba,Simone Albanesi,Sebastiano Bernuzzi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We compute the gravitational waveform emitted during the transition from quasi-spherical inspiral to plunge, merger and ringdown for a system of two black holes in the extreme mass ratio limit, where the primary is spinning and the secondary is represented by a nonspinning point-particle inspiralling along inclined orbits. The point-particle dynamics is described via a Hamiltonian formalism and the transition is driven by an effective-one-body like radiation reaction force. The gravitational waveform is obtained solving numerically, in the time-domain, the Teukolsky equation with a $\delta$-like source. The waveform is systematically characterized varying the black hole spin magnitude between $(0,0.9)$ and the inclination angle of the orbit between $(0,\pi)$. We consider all multipoles up to $\ell=4$ and compute the energy and angular momentum losses during the plunge. The impact of the $m\neq \ell$ modes grows as the inclination angle is increased. We also use our framework to quantify the accuracy of the approximate inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform for an inclined orbit that can be obtained by applying a suitable time-dependent rotation to a given spin-aligned waveform with approximately consistent (but constant) spin-orbit coupling.",
New submissions,"Exploring Wormhole Structures within the Framework of $f(R,L_{m})$ Gravity","A.S. Agrawal,Baljeet Kaur Lotte,Reshma Kapse,B. Mishra",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we investigate wormhole geometries within the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity by considering a specific form of the model. From the corresponding field equations, the shape function is derived, and the traversability conditions are examined for suitable choices of the model parameters. The obtained shape function is shown to satisfy all the necessary requirements for a traversable wormhole, including the energy conditions. The geometric properties of the wormhole are analyzed in detail, and particular attention is given to the requirement that the proper radial distance $l(r)$ remains finite throughout the space-time, thereby ensuring the consistency of the geometry.",
New submissions,Observational features of the Bardeen-boson star with thin disk accretion,"Chen-Yu Yang,Huan Ye,Xiao-Xiong Zeng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we construct spherically symmetric solutions of Bardeen--boson stars within the framework of the Einstein--Klein--Gordon theory coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics by employing numerical methods. Considering a thin accretion disk in the equatorial plane as the light source, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of boson stars using the ray-tracing method and the stereographic projection technique. Particular attention is paid to the influence of the initial scalar field $\phi_0$, the magnetic charge $\mathcal{G}$, and the observation angle $\theta_o$, on the image structure. As compact horizonless objects, boson stars produce optical images dominated by direct emission, while their morphology undergoes significant distortions as $\theta_o$ increases. Higher values of $\phi_0$ and $\theta_o$ can give rise to lensing images. For all the parameters, the image center exhibits a brightness depression similar to the inner shadow of black holes, which poses challenges for distinguishing between boson stars and black holes. To address this, we propose two possible approaches: (i) combining the analysis of lensing bands with the effective potential to determine the existence of photon rings; and (ii) examining the polarization effects under synchrotron emission mechanisms. These results provide theoretical support for future high-resolution imaging efforts aimed at discriminating boson stars from black holes.",
New submissions,Observational constraints on the nonlinear regime of gravity with a parametrized beyond-GR gravitational waveform model,"Daiki Watarai,Atsushi Nishizawa,Hiroki Takeda,Hayato Imafuku,Kipp Cannon",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences provide unique opportunities to test general relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. In particular, the merger phase, during which two compact objects finally coalesce, corresponds to the regime of the strongest gravitational fields accessible by direct observation and thus serves as a probe of the nonlinear nature of gravity. In this work, we test GR in the merger phase by analyzing GW150914 using a modified waveform proposed in [Watarai et al. 2024], which parametrizes possible deviations from GR during this stage. Within this framework, the inferred deviation parameters can be translated into model-independent constraints on physically meaningful quantities. For GW150914, we find that the additional energy radiated in the merger phase is constrained to be $0.26^{+0.75}_{-0.62}~\%$ of the total energy emitted over the entire coalescence predicted by GR, and the deviation in the coalescence time is $2.17^{+9.56}_{-9.90}~\mathrm{ms}$, both within the $90\%$ credible interval.

New submissions,Quantum corrections to Dymnikova-Schwinger black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,"A. Errehymy,Y. Khedif,M. Daoud,K. Myrzakulov,B. Turimov,T. Myrzakul",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work investigates black holes within a modified framework of gravity that incorporates quantum-inspired corrections and a fundamental minimal length scale. By integrating Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a specially tailored matter source that models quantum particle creation, we derive novel, non-singular black hole solutions. These black holes exhibit rich horizon structures and, notably, do not undergo complete evaporation -- instead, they stabilize into permanent remnants. In addition to analyzing the thermodynamic implications of quantum corrections to Dymnikova-Schwinger black holes, we examine their quasinormal mode spectra using the WKB approximation, alongside their associated energy emission rates. Our findings provide compelling new perspectives on how quantum effects may address foundational issues such as the black hole information loss paradox.",
New submissions,Quasibound states of massless spin particles in Schwarzschild equivalent mediums,"Li-Qin Mi,Dandan Li,Zhong-Heng Li",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that, in Schwarzschild equivalent mediums, the massless spin particles obey the same dynamical equation, from which we obtain remarkably simple formulae for the frequencies of the quasibound states. We find that the quasibound frequencies of different bosons can be identical at the same quantum number $l$, and the same is true of different fermions, but a quasibound frequency for bosons can never equal a quasibound frequency for fermions. These results mean that, in Schwarzschild equivalent mediums with the quasibound-state boundary conditions, characteristics of electromagnetic waves are the same as those for all the massless bosonic waves, thereby allowing electromagnetic waves to simulate gravitational waves. Our predictions can be tested in future experiments, building upon the successful preparation of Schwarzschild equivalent mediums.",
New submissions,Well-posedness of Ricci Flow in Lorentzian Spacetime and its Entropy Formula,M.J.Luo,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"This paper attempts to construct monotonic entropy functionals for four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime under certain physical boundary conditions, as an extension of Perelman's monotonic entropy functionals constructed for three-dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds. The monotonicity of these entropy functionals is utilized to prove the well-posedness of applying Ricci flow to four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, particularly for the timelike modes which would seem blow up and ill-defined. The general idea is that the the Ricci flow of a Lorentzian spacetime metric and the coupled conjugate heat flow of a density on the Lorentzian spacetime as a whole turns out to be the gradient flows of the monotonic functionals under some imposed constraint, so the superficial ""blow-up"" in the individual Ricci flow system or the conjugate heat flow system contradicts the boundedness of the monotonic functionals within finite flow interval, which gives a global control to the whole coupled system. The physical significance and applications of these monotonic entropy functionals in real gravitational systems are also discussed.",
New submissions,Radiation-reaction correction to scattering binary dynamics at the Next-to-Leading Post-Newtonian Order,"Donato Bini,Andrea Geralico,Sara Rufrano Aliberti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We compute the next-to-leading-order radiation-reaction modification to the harmonic coordinate quasi-Keplerian parametrization of the binary dynamics, the two bodies undergoing a scattering process. The solution for the radiation-reaction corrections to the orbital parameters is examined both in the time domain and in the frequency domain. The knowledge of the radiation-reaction corrected orbit is a key ingredient for the calculation of the fractional 3.5PN corrections to the radiative losses as well as to the radiative multipole moments needed to build up the waveform at the same accuracy.",
New submissions,The Flight of the Bumblebee in a Non-Commutative Geometry: A New Black Hole Solution,"A. A. Araújo Filho,N. Heidari,Iarley P. Lobo,Yuxuan Shi,Francisco S. N. Lobo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This paper investigates a new black hole solution within the framework of bumblebee gravity, incorporating non-commutative corrections parameterized by $\Theta$ and implemented through the Moyal twist $\partial_r \wedge \partial_\theta$. Notably, the event horizon remains unaffected by $\Theta$, while the surface gravity becomes ill-defined, in agreement with the behavior previously reported for the non-commutative Schwarzschild black hole [1]. The propagation of light is examined by analyzing null geodesics, identifying critical orbits, and determining the resulting black hole shadow. To complement these analyses, we explore gravitational lensing by evaluating the deflection angle in both the weak- and strong-field regimes. Using these results, constraints are derived for the lensing observables by comparing with the Event Horizon Telescope data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, we close the analysis by deriving additional constraints from standard Solar System experiments, including Mercury's orbital precession, gravitational light bending, and time-delay measurements.",
New submissions,Non-linearly scalarized supermassive black holes,"Shoupan Liu,Yunqi Liu,Yan Peng,Cheng-Yong Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we investigate a nonlinear mechanism driving the formation of scalarized rotating black holes within a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity framework that includes an additional squared Gauss-Bonnet term. With the specific coupling function, Kerr metric is a solution to this modified gravity. In linear level Kerr black holes are stable against the scalar perturbation, while nonlinearly they suffer the so-called ``nonlinear scalarization"" and are unstable. By employing a pseudo-spectral method, we derive the spectrum of nonlinearly scalarized rotating black hole solutions, revealing multiple scalarized branches. Our analysis demonstrates that both the black hole's spin and the additional squared Gauss-Bonnet term significantly influence the existence and properties of these solutions. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic properties of nonlinearly scalarized rotating black holes, and find that the scalarized black holes are entropically favored over Kerr black holes of the same mass and spin across a wide range of parameters.",
New submissions,Global stability of ghostly field theories: Classical scattering in $(N+1)$ dimensions,Aaron Held,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We review results on small-data global stability and highlight their applicability to classical interacting scalar fields with opposite-sign kinetic terms (ghosts). Further, we present a one-parameter family of numerical scattering solutions under the simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry. We thereby identify classical ghostly field theories with polynomial interaction potentials for which small-data global stability apparently extends to large-data global stability, i.e., global stability for all compactly supported initial data. These global stability results support an underlying physical mechanism by which the ghost instability can be quenched due to dominant self-interactions, at least in classical physics.",
New submissions,Arbitrarily long-lived quasinormal modes of proper-time flow black holes,Milena Skvortsova,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massive scalar field in the background of a regular black hole arising from the proper-time flow in asymptotically safe gravity. This quantum-corrected geometry, characterized by a deformation parameter q, smoothly interpolates between a near-extremal regular black hole and the Schwarzschild solution. Employing both the WKB approximation with Padé resummation and time-domain integration, we compute the complex frequencies for various values of the scalar field mass $\mu$, multipole number $\ell$, and deformation parameter q. We observe that the real parts of the QNMs increase with the field mass, while the imaginary parts exhibit behavior indicative of long-lived modes. Although quasi-resonances are not detected in the time-domain profiles due to the dominance of late-time tails, we find that the asymptotic decay follows an oscillatory slowly decaying behavior with the power-law envelope.",

D'Addona",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the anisotropic stress parameter, $\eta=\Psi/\Phi$, defined as the ratio of the gravitational potentials in the linearly perturbed Friedmann-Lemaître Robertson-Walker metric, as a probe of deviations from general relativity across astrophysical to cosmological scales. Using mass profiles reconstructed from high-precision lensing and kinematics of nine galaxy clusters from the CLASH-VLT sample, we derive $\eta(r)$ as a function of the radial distance from the cluster centres, over the range $[0.1 \,\text{Mpc},1.2\,r_{200}^L]$, where $r_{200}^L$ is virial radius best-fit from lensing data. When using a Navarro-Frenk-White or an Hernquist profile to model the total matter distribution, we find consistency with general relativity ($\eta = 1$) within $2\sigma$ for the full radial range for all the sampled clusters. However, adopting a Burkert profile introduces mild tension with general relativity, reaching the $3\sigma$ level in two systems. Assuming a negligible time-dependence in the redshift range spawned by the clusters, we obtain the joint constraint $\eta (r= 1.0 \, \text{Mpc}) = 0.93^{+0.48}_{-0.40}$ (stat) $\pm 0.47$ (syst) at $95\% $ confidence level -- an improvement of approximately $40\%$ over previous estimates. We discuss the impact of systematics on the constraints, and we highlight the implications of this result for current and upcoming cluster surveys.",
Cross submissions,The Noise of Vacuum,Gabriela Barenboim(IFIC),Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the evolution of primordial cosmological perturbations in a vacuum decay model where de Sitter space transitions to radiation domination through quantum-thermal decay processes. Unlike standard inflation, this framework generates curvature perturbations through stochastic noise from vacuum decay rather than quantum fluctuations of an inflaton field. We derive the stochastic differential equation governing the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}(t)$ and show that any horizon crossing is brief and does not constitute the primary mechanism for perturbation generation. Scale dependence emerges from spatial correlations in the noise rather than horizon crossing dynamics. The model naturally addresses the horizon and flatness problems through initial thermal equilibrium in de Sitter space and predicts zero tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that spatially correlated noise can generate observationally viable spectral tilts while maintaining Gaussian statistics.",
Cross submissions,Linear Higher-Order Maxwell-Einstein-Scalar Theories,"Mohammad Ali Gorji,Shinji Mukohyama,Pavel Petrov,Masahide Yamaguchi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the context of the Higher-Order Maxwell-Einstein-Scalar (HOMES) theories, which are invariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms and $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we study two broad subclasses: the first is up to linear in $R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$, $\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu\phi$, $\nabla_\rho{F}_{\mu\nu}$ and up to quadratic in the vector field strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$; the second is up to linear in $\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu\phi$, contains no second derivatives of vector field and metric, but allows for arbitrary functions/powers of $F_{\mu\nu}$. Under these assumptions, we systematically derive the most general form of the action that leads to second-order (or lower) equations of motion. We prove that, among 41 possible terms in the first subclass, only four independent higher-derivative terms are allowed: the kinetic gravity braiding term $G_3(\phi,X)\Box\phi$ in the scalar sector with $X = -\nabla_\mu\phi \nabla^\mu\phi / 2$; the Horndeski non-minimal coupling term $w_0(\phi)R_{\beta \delta \alpha \gamma}\tilde{F}^{\alpha \beta } \tilde{F}^{\gamma \delta }$ in the vector field sector, where $\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$ is the Hodge dual of $F_{\mu\nu}$; and two interaction terms between the scalar and vector field sectors: $[w_1(\phi,X) g_{\rho\sigma} + w_2(\phi,X) \nabla_{\rho}\phi \nabla_{\sigma}\phi] \nabla_\beta\nabla_\alpha\phi \, \tilde{F}^{\alpha \rho } \tilde{F}^{\beta\sigma}$. For the second subclass, which admits 11 possible terms, three of these four, excluding the Horndeski non-minimal coupling term proportional to $w_0(\phi)$, are allowed. These independent terms serve as the building blocks of each subclass of HOMES. Remarkably, there is no higher-derivative parity-violating term in either subclass. Finally, we propose a new generalization of higher-derivative interaction terms for the case of a charged complex scalar field.",
Cross submissions,Evaluation of the magnetic field of hot Jupiters within the geometric approach,"Babenko I.A.,Zhilkin A.G",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Theoretical and experimental foundations of the hypothesis about the origin of the magnetic fields of the Earth and other astrophysical objects, proposed in the early 20th century by W. Sutherland, A. Einstein, and independently by Yu.S. Vladimirov, are discussed in the paper. According to this hypothesis, the electric charges of the electron and proton slightly differ in magnitude, leading to the emergence of a magnetic field in rotating astrophysical objects. The theoretical justification of the Sutherland-Einstein hypothesis is presented in a simplified version of the 6D Kaluza-Klein theory, taking into account the consequences of the Kerr-Newman metric. The analysis shows that a fundamental dipole-type magnetic field should arise around any massive rotating body. However, in real astrophysical objects, such a field is largely screened and distorted by induced charges and currents. As an application, we consider the problem of determining the magnetic fields of hot Jupiters, since the strong tidal effects in these giant exoplanets should result in approximately similar screening mechanisms.",
Cross submissions,Binary black holes in magnetized AGN disks,"Raj Kishor Joshi,Aryan Bhake,Biswajit Banerjee,Bhargav Vaidya,Milton Ruiz,Antonios Tsokaros,Andrea Mignone,Marica Branchesi,Amit Shukla,Miljenko Čemeljić",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers occurring within the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising sources for gravitational waves detectable by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) interferometers. Some of these events have also been potentially associated with transient electromagnetic flares, indicating that BBH mergers in dense environments may be promising sources of multi-messenger signals. To investigate the prospects for electromagnetic emission from these systems, we study the dynamics of accretion flows onto BBHs embedded in AGN disks using numerical simulations. Although recent studies have explored this scenario, they often employ simplified disk models that neglect magnetic fields. In this work, we examine how strong magnetic fields influence and regulate the accretion onto such binary systems. In this context, we conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical local shearing-box simulations of a binary black hole system embedded within a magnetized disk of an AGN.We observe that the dynamically important magnetic fields can drive the formation of well-collimated outflows capable of penetrating the vertical extent of the AGN disk. However, outflow generation is not ubiquitous and strongly depends on the radial distance of the binary from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). In particular, binaries placed at a larger distance from the central SMBH show relatively more transient accretion and the formation of stronger spiral shocks. Furthermore, accretion behavior onto the binary system via individual circum-singular disks (CSDs) is also modulated by local AGN disk properties. Our simulations highlight the importance of shear velocity in the amplification of the toroidal magnetic field component, which plays a crucial role in governing the outflow strength.",
Cross submissions,"Ghost-free, gauge invariant SVT generalizations of Horndeski theory","S. Mironov,A. Shtennikova,M. Valencia-Villegas",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a new type of Scalar-Vector-Tensor (SVT) theories with higher derivatives of all the fields in the action, but with second order equations of motion. The higher derivative vector field is invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation and the Scalar-Tensor sector corresponds to Horndeski theory. We also present a subclass of these SVT theories with 8 free functions of $\pi$ and $X$ where the speed of the tensor and vector modes is exactly the same. In particular, the Horndeski functions $G_4(\pi,X)$ and $G_5(\pi)$ remain free, while the speed of the vector modes tracks the speed of the tensor modes. Additionally, the vector sector retains freedom through the four new functions. All the theories here shown are a generalization of the Kaluza-Klein reduction of 5D Horndeski theory, sharing the main properties in cosmology, but including new free scalar functions in the Lagrangian.",

Space-borne gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to measure displacement variations between two free test masses caused by gravitational waves. Space-borne gravitational wave detectors require extremely high measurement accuracy, making it necessary to take into account the effects of space plasma and magnetic field. On one hand, laser propagation through space plasma can induce optical path difference noise, affecting distance measurement accuracy. On the other hand, interactions between space magnetic field and the test masses can generate acceleration noise. This review introduces studies on laser propagation noise and space magnetic acceleration noise in space gravitational wave detection. And this review presents a method, time-delay interferometry, to suppress laser propagation noise.",
Cross submissions,Late-Time Cosmological Constraints on Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy,"Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano,Andronikos Paliathanasis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy is a one-parameter extension of the standard HDE framework, in which the horizon entropy is reformulated using Kaniadakis entropy. At the cosmological level, it has been shown to give rise to modified Friedmann equations, leading to a richer phenomenology compared to $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we test the Kanadiakis holography model against multiple late-time observational probes, including Type Ia supernovae from PantheonPlus and Union3, Cosmic Chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Using a Bayesian inference approach with MCMC methods, we constrain the cosmological parameters of the model and evaluate its performance against $\Lambda$CDM through the Akaike Information Criterion. We find that Kaniadakis holography can provide a better fit for some data combinations, although $\Lambda$CDM remains slightly statistically favored overall. These results highlight Kaniadakis holography as a competitive alternative to the standard cosmological model, offering valuable insights into the role of generalized entropy in dark energy dynamics.",

This generalizes the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution to the rotating case, and extends the recent multi-centered rotating black hole solutions of Teo and Wan to configurations with unequal electric and magnetic charges. The resulting spacetimes are free of curvature singularities, conical defects, Dirac-Misner strings, and closed timelike curves, both on and outside the horizons, provided that the black holes have either aligned or anti-aligned spin orientations.",

Ferreira,Carlos García-García",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.",
Cross submissions,Neural likelihood estimators for flexible gravitational wave data analysis,"Luca Negri,Anuradha Samajdar",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we develop a Neural Likelihood Estimator and apply it to analyse real gravitational-wave (GW) data for the first time. We assess the usability of neural likelihood for GW parameter estimation and report the parameter space where neural likelihood performs as a robust estimator to output posterior probability distributions using modest computational resources. In addition, we demonstrate that the trained Neural likelihood can also be used in further analysis, enabling us to obtain the evidence corresponding to a hypothesis, making our method a complete tool for parameter estimation. Particularly, our method requires around 100 times fewer likelihood evaluations than standard Bayesian algorithms to infer properties of a GW signal from a binary black hole system as observed by current generation ground-based detectors. The fairly simple neural network architecture chosen makes for cheap training, which allows our method to be used on-the-fly without the need for special hardware and ensures our method is flexible to use any waveform model, noise model, or prior. We show results from simulations as well as results from GW150914 as proof of the effectiveness of our algorithm.",
Cross submissions,Finite Entropy Implies Finite Dimension in Quantum Gravity,T. Banks,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Quantum Field Theory (QFT) introduced us to the notion that a causal diamond in space-time corresponded to a subsystem of a quantum mechanical system defined on the global space-time. Work by Jacobson\cite{ted95}, Fischler and Susskind\cite{fs} and particularly Bousso\cite{bousso} suggested that in the quantum theory of gravity this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made in\cite{tb}\cite{wf}. ``String theory constructions"" of ``meta-stable dS states"" always involve a model with an infinite number of states. The real challenge of such models is to define the asymptotic correlation functions of the space-time to which the dS space decays, and show how to isolate properties of the dS ``resonance"" from those correlators. We argue that the theory of the resonance itself is adequately described, on time scales shorter than its lifetime, by a model with a finite number of states.",
Cross submissions,Analysis of polymerized superconducting circuits,"Sean Crowe,Stefan Evans,Alexei Smolyaninov",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We apply polymer quantization, a quantization technique sometimes used in high energy physics, to several superconducting circuits including: transmons, transmission line resonators, and LC circuits. In the case of transmon qubits and transmission line resonators, experimental predictions are very close to what is found with canonical quantization, though in this approach constant charge offsets can be interpreted as quantization ambiguities. In the case of LC circuits, polymer quantization predicts nonlinearities which are not present in the canonical approach. Based on this analysis we design and analyze a qubit which uses a meander inductor instead of a Josephson junction. Implications for qubit performance and fabrication are discussed. Given a choice for an effective phase operator, relevant parameters such as anharmonicity, frequency, and dispersive shifts are calculated for this meander inductor based qubit.",
Cross submissions,On the geometry and uniqueness of asymptotically locally hyperbolic static vacuum black holes,"Brian Harvie,Ye-Kai Wang",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We establish an inequality relating the surface gravity and topology of a horizon in a $3$-dimensional asymptotically locally hyperbolic static space with the geometry at infinity. Equality is achieved only by the Kottler black holes, and this rigidity leads to several new static black hole uniqueness theorems for a negative cosmological constant. First, the ADS-Schwarzschild black hole with critical surface gravity $\kappa=\sqrt{-\Lambda}$ is unique. Second, the toroidal Kottler black holes are unique in the absence of spherical horizons. Third, the hyperbolic Kottler black holes with mass $m>0$ are unique *if* the generalized Penrose inequality holds for the corresponding class of static spaces. Building on work of Ge-Wang-Wu-Xia, we then use this fact to obtain uniqueness for static ALH graphs with hyperbolic infinities.This inequality follows from a generalization of the Minkowski inequality in ADS-Schwarzschild space due to Brendle-Hung-Wang. Using optimal coefficients for the sub-static Heintze-Karcher inequality, we construct a new monotone quantity under inverse mean curvature flow (IMCF) in static spaces with ${\Lambda} < 0$. Another fundamental tool developed in this paper is a regularity theorem for IMCF in asymptotically locally hyperbolic manifolds. Specifically, we prove that a weak solution of IMCF in an ALH 3-manifold with horizon boundary is eventually smooth. This extends the regularity theorem for a spherical infinity due to Shi and Zhu.",
