New submissions,Reheating in geometric Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity,Ioannis D. Gialamas,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study Weyl-invariant purely gravitational theories formulated within the Einstein-Cartan framework. In the Einstein-frame description, these models are dynamically equivalent to standard general relativity coupled to an axion-like pseudoscalar degree of freedom, which naturally drives a period of cosmic inflation. Without committing to a specific microscopic mechanism for reheating, we demonstrate that the post-inflationary reheating dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the inflationary predictions. In particular, we show that assumptions about the reheating temperature and the equation-of-state parameter can significantly affect the predicted values of inflationary observables, highlighting the necessity of consistently incorporating reheating effects in the phenomenological analysis of inflationary models.",
New submissions,Jacobson's thermodynamic approach to classical gravity applied to non-Riemmanian geometries: remarks on the simplicity of Nature,"Jhan N. Martinez(1),Jose F. Rodriguez-Ruiz(2),Yeinzon Rodriguez(1,2) ((1) Universidad Industrial de Santander, (2) Universidad Antonio Narino)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Three decades ago, Ted Jacobson surprised us with a very appealing approach to classical gravity. According to his proposal, the gravitational field equations are the consequence of the first law of thermodynamics applied, locally, to a Rindler observer. Together with the dynamical laws of black holes, Jacobson's approach has become a very strong piece of evidence supporting the intimate connection between gravity, thermodynamics, and quantum theory. Jacobson's approach being formulated for Riemannian geometries, we have wondered what its consequences would be for non-Riemannian geometries, i.e., those that involve torsion, non metricity, or both. The results of our quest have been particularly appealing: we have found that the gravitational theory that derives from the Einstein-Hilbert action, arguably ``the simplest one'', does not belong to the pool of gravitational theories available for Nature's selection (except in the Riemannian case). In the search of a unique alternative, we have also considered the hypotheses employed in the formulation of the Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity. Together, the two approaches point towards the gravitational theory that derives from the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a term quadratic in the torsion vector as the one that would be selected by Nature in the non-Riemannian case without non metricity. The same strategy cannot be followed in the full non-Riemannian case as the two approaches are mutually inconsistent.",
New submissions,Realization of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 in Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity,"Yuxuan Kang,Mingzhe Li,Changzhi Yi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent observations from the DESI Collaboration indicate a preference for quintom dark energy, i.e., its equation of state evolves across the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we provide a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by introducing the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density in teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the intrinsic difficulties in the old models.",
New submissions,Charged Superradiant Instability of Spherically Symmetric Regular Black Holes in de Sitter Spacetime: Time- and Frequency-Domain Analysis,"Yizhi Zhan,Hengyu Xu,Haowei Chen,Shao-Jun Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the superradiant instability of Ayón-Beato-García-de Sitter (ABG-dS) black holes under massless charged scalar perturbations using both time-domain evolutions and frequency-domain computations. We show that the instability occurs only for the spherically symmetric mode with $\ell=0$, whereas asymptotically flat ABG black holes remain stable in the massless limit, which underscores the essential role of the cosmological horizon in providing a confining boundary. We further study the dependence of the growth rate on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, the scalar charge $q$, and the black hole charge $Q$, finding that it reaches a maximum at intermediate values of $\Lambda$ and $q$ and increases monotonically with $Q$. Compared with Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter black holes, ABG-dS black holes exhibit distinct instability characteristics due to the modified electrostatic potential induced by nonlinear electrodynamics.",
New submissions,Null Raychaudhuri Equation and the Impossibility of Traversable Wormholes in Unimodular Gravity,"Erick Pastén,Marco Bosquez,Norman Cruz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We formulate the traversability of wormhole throats as a local and covariant null defocusing condition derived from the Raychaudhuri equation. Since unimodular gravity preserves the local geometric structure of spacetime, the null focusing properties of geodesic congruences are unchanged with respect to general relativity. We show that any genuinely traversable wormhole in unimodular gravity necessarily violates the null energy condition, establishing a local no--go theorem for wormholes supported by ordinary matter in this framework.",
New submissions,"Non-exotic asymptotically flat wormholes in $f(Q,T)$ gravity","Sara Rastgoo,Foad Parsaei,Soudabe Nasirimoghadam",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we investigate the possible existence of static and spherically symmetric wormhole solutions within the context of the newly formulated extended $f(Q,T)$ gravity. We analyze a linear model, $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+ \beta T$, and focus on traversable wormholes. By applying the variational method, we derive modified versions of the field equations that are influenced by an anisotropic matter source for a zero redshift function. It has been observed that the violation of energy conditions is influenced by the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We reach the conclusion that solutions which violate the radial and lateral null energy condition in the context of general relativity may still adhere to the energy conditions within the realm of $f(Q,T)$ gravity. To begin with, by utilizing a linear equation of state for radial pressure, we obtain a power-law shape function. Additionally, we investigate solutions defined by a variable equation of state parameter. A broad spectrum of non-exotic wormhole solutions has been identified, contingent upon the particular parameters of the model.",
New submissions,Chaotic Dynamics due Prolate and Oblate Sources in Kerr-like and Hartle-Thorne Spacetimes with and without Magnetic Field,"Adrián Eduarte-Rojas,Francisco Frutos-Alfaro,Rodrigo Carboni",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"As demonstrated by observations, every stellar-mass object rotates around some axis; some objects spin faster than others due to different mechanisms. Furthermore, these spinning objects are slightly deformed and are no longer perfect spheres because of hydrostatic equilibrium. The well-known Kerr solution of the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) represents the spacetime surrounding a rotating spherical gravitational source. However, real objects deviate from a perfect sphere and may be prolate or oblate. There are several solutions of the EFE that represent the spacetime of deformed objects. The Kerr--like (KL) metric represents the spacetime surrounding this kind of object, where the deformation is characterized by the mass quadrupole moment parameter $q_{\mathrm{KL}}$. When $q_{\mathrm{KL}} \neq 0$, the Carter constant no longer exists and the equations of motion (EOM) are no longer integrable; therefore, the system exhibits chaotic orbits. Another widely used solution is the Hartle--Thorne (HT) metric, which has similar characteristics and represents a slightly deformed, slowly rotating star. The HT metric has several versions, and two of them were selected to test their validity. The traditional HT version, which contains logarithmic terms, is less accurate than the version with exponential terms. Moreover, both the KL and HT metrics may be extended to include contributions due to the magnetic dipole moment of the source. The equations of motion (EOM) were computed, and these new dynamical systems display several interesting features, which are shown in their Poincar'e sections.",
New submissions,Path Integrated Geodesics and Distances,Nima Khosravi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, the quantum corrections to the kinematics of geometry, specifically geodesics, are presented. This is done by employing the path integral over the geodesics. Interestingly, the geodesics do not see any modifications in this framework. However for the distances, it is demonstrated that these quantum corrections exhibit distinct behaviors for time-like, light-like, and space-like geodesics. For time-like geodesics, the maximum correction is the Planck length, which disappears when the classical separation vanishes. The light-like geodesics do not exhibit quantum corrections, meaning that the causal light cone remains the same in both classical and quantum frameworks under certain conditions. The quantum corrections for space-like geodesics impose a minimum on space-like separation, potentially playing a role in removing singularities by preventing null congruences from being closer than the Planck length. This framework also explores the correspondence between space-like/time-like geodesics and quantum/statistical physics.",
New submissions,A Local Lorentz Invariance test with LAGEOS satellites,"David Lucchesi,Massimo Visco,Roberto Peron,José C. Rodriguez,Giuseppe Pucacco,Luciano Anselmo,Massimo Bassan,Graham Appleby,Marco Cinelli,Alessandro Di Marco,Marco Lucente,Carmelo Magnafico,Carmen Pardini,Feliciana Sapio",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Strong theoretical arguments suggest that a breakdown of Lorentz Invariance could arise under some very particular conditions. From an experimental point of view, it is important to test the Local Lorentz Invariance with ever greater precision and in all contexts, regardless of the theoretical motivation for the possible violation. In this paper we discuss some aspects of the gravitational sector. Tests of Lorentz Invariance in the context of gravity are difficult and rare in the literature. Possible violations could arise from quantum physics applied to gravity or the presence of vector and tensor fields mediating the gravitational interaction together with the metric tensor of General Relativity. We present our results in the latter case. We analyzed the orbit of the LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites over a period of almost three decades. The effects of the possible preferred frame represented by the cosmic microwave background radiation on the mean argument of latitude of the satellites orbit were considered. These effects would manifest themselves mainly through the post-Newtonian parameter $\alpha_1$, a parameter that has a null value in General Relativity. We constrain this parameterized post-Newtonian parameter down to the level of $\alpha_1 \le 2\times10^{-5}$, improving a previous limit obtained through the Lunar Laser Ranging technique.",
New submissions,$δN$ formalism with gradient interactions,"S. Mohammad Ahmadi,Nahid Ahmadi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The standard $\delta N$ formalism, a cornerstone for calculating nonlinear curvature perturbations on super-Hubble scales, relies on the separate universe assumption, in which spatial gradients are neglected. However, this approximation breaks down in scenarios critical for primordial black hole formation, such as transitions to an ultra-slow-roll phase, where gradient interactions induce significant non-conservation of the comoving curvature perturbation. In this Letter, we introduce a framework that incorporates gradient corrections into the $\delta N$ formalism at a desired order by adding an effective source term to the background Klein--Gordon equation. This approach allows for a nonlinear treatment of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation considering initial conditions at the time of horizon exit. By computing the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{eq}}$, we demonstrate that our method captures essential features missed by the standard $\delta N$, offering a simple yet rigorous pathway to determine nonlinear evolution expected from cosmological perturbation theory.",
New submissions,Tripartite quantum steering in Schwarzschild spacetime,"Guang-Wei Mi,Xiaofen Huang,Tinggui Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We investigate the effects of Hawking radiation on quantum steering and steering asymmetry in a tripartite system embedded in Schwarzschild spacetime. All tripartite steering types were classified,comprising three ""1 to 2"" and three ""2 to 1"" steering cases. Through a systematic analysis of all physically relevant scenarios (including accessible and inaccessible modes), we classify three canonical scenarios with one, two and three physically accessible modes. In the scenario of three physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation disrupts quantum steering, with the maximum steering asymmetry during the two-way steering to one-way steering transition precisely demarcating the phase boundary between these regimes. For two physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation exhibits dual behavior: enhancing the steering from Alice and Bob to anti-Charlie under certain parameters while suppressing it under others, while net strengthening other steering types. When considering one physically accessible mode, the Hawking effect of the black hole significantly enhances quantum steering. These findings provide new insights into quantum correlations in curved spacetime and establish observable signatures of Hawking effects in quantum steering phenomena.",
New submissions,Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole in Quasi-topological Gravity,"Gen Li,Yong-Qiang Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We construct higher-dimensional traversable wormholes in quasi-topological gravity (QTG) supported by a phantom scalar field. Using a static, spherically symmetric ansatz, we numerically analyze how quasi-topological gravity corrections affect the geometry and physical properties of the wormhole solutions. The resulting wormhole solutions are symmetric about the throat. Negative mass can arise for certain choices of parameters. For certain parameter ranges, the scalar charge $\mathcal{D}$ of the phantom field rapidly decreases with increasing the higher-curvature coupling parameter $\alpha$ and approaches zero. Moreover, by changing $\alpha$, the overall level of the Kretschmann scalar is also lowered. Finally, for sufficiently large $\alpha$, $-g_{tt}$ becomes close to zero near the throat, exhibiting a ``horizon''-like structure.",
New submissions,Charged nutty black holes are hairy,"Dmitri Gal'tsov,Rostom Karsanov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We uncover the physical nature of the electric and magnetic monopoles discovered by McGuire and Ruffini on Misner strings accompanying charged nutty black holes, showing that these strings carry singular, nonuniform flows of electric and magnetic fields. These fields inevitably have nonzero divergence, thereby simulating the effective electric and magnetic charge densities along the strings. The latter create a complex short-range electromagnetic hair zone around the horizon, making the combined Misner-Dirac strings classically observable. Typical features of this new type of hair are presented. We also note that rotation can act as a hair generator even in the absence of NUT.",
New submissions,Testing the wormhole echo hypothesis for GW231123,"Qi Lai,Qing-Yu Lan,Zhan-He Wang,Yun-Song Piao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The short-duration gravitational-wave (GW) event GW231123 has inferred component masses in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits a burst-like morphology with no clearly inspiral, making it an interesting target for tests beyond the standard binary black hole (BBH) interpretation. In this work, motivated by its phenomenological similarity to GW190521, we test whether GW231123 is compatible with a wormhole-echo scenario by modeling a leading echo pulse with a well-motivated phenomenological sine-Gaussian wavepacket. We perform Bayesian model comparison against a BBH baseline described by the IMRPhenomXPHM-SpinTaylor waveform, and obtain the Bayes factor ratio $\ln B^{\rm Echo}_{\rm BBH} = 1.87$, corresponding to weak-to-moderate support for the echo hypothesis. In our previous analysis for GW190521 within the same overall framework, we found $\ln B^{\rm Echo}_{\rm BBH} \approx -2.9$, implying a shift of $\Delta \ln B \approx 4.8$ between the two events. This sign change indicates that GW231123 is more compatible with a single-pulse echo description than GW190521.",
New submissions,Reduced Phase Space Quantization and Quantum Corrected Entropy of Schwarzschild-de Sitter Horizons,"S. Jalalzadeh,H. Moradpour",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper investigates the quantization of the Schwarzschild--de Sitter (SdS) black hole (BH) using the Misner--Sharp--Hernandez (MSH) mass as the internal energy in a reduced phase space framework. After introducing the canonical variables of the reduced phase space, we derive a discrete spectrum for the surface areas of the BH event horizon (EH) as well as MSH masses. We utilized the MSH mass spectrum to obtain the entropy of the BH. The entropy of the BH and cosmic EHs reveals a logarithmic correction to the Bekenstein--Hawking term. Our results support the robustness of the logarithmic form of quantum corrections in SdS thermodynamics.",
New submissions,Hyperbolicity analysis of the linearised 3+1 formulation in the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity,"Cheng Cheng,Maria Jose Guzman",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the properties of the principal symbol of the 3+1 equations of motion in Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) and assess the conditions for hyperbolicity. We use the Hamiltonian formulation based on the vectorial, antisymmetric, symmetric trace-free, and trace (VAST) decomposition of the canonical variables in the Hamiltonian formalism, and the Hamilton's equations previously presented in the literature. We study the system of differential equations at the linear level, and show that the principal symbol has a sector with imaginary eigenvalues, which renders the system not hyperbolic. This situation persists by taking spatial derivatives in either one or three coordinate directions, and it should be interpreted as a problem of the specific gauge choice instead of a general problem with TEGR. The first practical use of Hamilton's equations in this work can be extended for proving well-posedness in spherical symmetry, and establish numerical relativity setups in TEGR.",
New submissions,Cosmic evolution from Lorentz-violating bumblebee dynamics and Tsallis holographic dark energy,"E. M. Siquieri,D. S. Cabral,A. F. Santos",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, the behavior, evolution, and expansion of the universe are investigated within a Lorentz-violating framework driven by Tsallis holographic dark energy. The cosmological extension is implemented through a spontaneously symmetry-breaking Bumblebee field, which is assumed to play a fundamental role in the dynamics of the universe. Estimates for key Lorentz-violating quantities are obtained, and the evolution of the Hubble parameter is analyzed from the early universe era to the present epoch. This formulation provides an alternative perspective on the Hubble tension.",
New submissions,"Observable Optical Signatures, Particle Dynamics and Epicyclic Frequencies of Mod(A)Max Black Holes","Faizuddin Ahmed,Ahmad Al-Badawi,Edilberto O. Silva",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we investigate the observable optical signatures of the Mod(A)Max black hole spacetime. We analyze key optical features, including the photon sphere, black hole shadow, and photon trajectories, and examine how these observables depend on the underlying geometric parameters, such as the electric charge and the Mod(A)Max coupling parameter. We further study the dynamics of neutral test particles in the vicinity of the black hole by deriving the effective potential within the Hamiltonian formalism. Using this potential, we obtain the specific energy and specific angular momentum for test particles on circular orbits of fixed radius, as well as the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), and explore how the geometric parameters influence these quantities and the ISCO radius. Finally, we derive the epicyclic (azimuthal, radial, and vertical) frequencies to analyze quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) exploring how the geometric parameters influences these and discuss their physical implications.",
New submissions,Radial perturbations of neutron stars in Scalar-Vector-Tensor (SVT),Hamza Boumaza,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate the equilibrium configurations and the radial perturbations of neutron stars in a subclass of Scalar-Vector-Tensor (SVT) theories. By solving the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in SVT theories for several values of the modified gravity parameter, we examine the impact of the spontaneous scalarization of charged neutron star (NSs), which arises from the coupling of the scalar field to the electromagnetic tensor and double-dual Reimann tensor, $L^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F_{\mu\nu}F_{\alpha\beta}$. Then we extend our study by deriving the action at quadratic order in linear perturbations of radial type and computing scalar quasinormal modes (QNMs)as well as the normal modes (NMs) showing the coincidence of stability and maximum mass points in generlar relativity (GR) is still present in this modified theory.",
New submissions,Complete asymptotics in the formation of quiescent big bang singularities,"Andrés Franco-Grisales,Hans Ringström",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"There are three categories of mathematical results concerning quiescent big bang singularities: the derivation of asymptotics in a symmetry class; the construction of spacetimes given initial data on the singularity; and the proof of big bang formation in the absence of symmetries, including the proof of stable big bang formation. In a recent article, the first author demonstrated the existence of developments corresponding to a geometric notion of initial data on a big bang singularity. Moreover, this article, combined with previous articles by the second author, gives a unified and geometric perspective on large classes of seemingly disparate results in the first two categories. Concerning the third category, Oude Groeniger et al recently formulated a general condition on initial data ensuring big bang formation, including curvature blow up. This result, among other things, generalises previous results on stable big bang formation. However, it does not include a statement saying that the solutions induce initial data on the singularity. Here we tie all three categories of results together by demonstrating that the solutions of Oude Groeniger et al induce data on the singularity. However, the results are more general and can potentially be used to derive similar conclusions in other gauges.",
Cross submissions,Impact of Perfect Fluid Dark Matter on the Appearance of Rotating Black Hole,"Huang Yu-Xiang,Guo Sen,Liang En-Wei,Lin Kai",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Understanding how dark matter affects the immediate environment of black holes (BHs) is crucial for interpreting horizon-scale observations. We study rotating BHs surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), exploring their observable features through both analytical and numerical approaches. Using the existence criterion of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), we first derive joint constraints on the PFDM intensity parameter~k and the spin parameter~a. Within the resulting physically allowed parameter regime, we perform high-resolution, general-relativistic ray-tracing simulations of thin accretion disks at 87~GHz and 230~GHz, capturing the detailed brightness morphology and photon ring structure shaped by PFDM. By incorporating angular diameter measurements of M87^{*} and Sgr~A^{*} from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), we further narrow down the viable parameter space and directly compare synthetic images with EHT observations of M87^{*}. We find that the inclusion of PFDM improves the agreement with the observed compact shadow and asymmetric brightness distribution, suggesting that dark matter may leave observable imprints on horizon-scale images. Our results position PFDM as a physically motivated extension to the Kerr geometry and highlight a promising astrophysical pathway for probing dark matter near BHs with current and future VLBI campaigns.",
Cross submissions,Model-Agnostic Population Inference for Gravitational-Wave Astronomy: From LIGO to LISA,"Yi-kun Li,Cheng Cheng,Lang Cui,Yun Fang",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inferring the intrinsic population of compact binary mergers is complicated by detector selection biases and measurement uncertainties. Traditional parametric methods are limited by the need to presuppose functional forms, introducing model-dependent biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an inference framework powered by deep generative modeling. We develop a flexible, data-driven population model using a Correlated Compound-Mixture Density Network. This architecture integrates mixture models to handle multimodality, Gaussian copulas for parameter dependencies, and a library of flexible marginal distributions. The network is trained to approximate the posterior distribution of the population's hyperparameters using amortized variational inference with Normalizing Flows on catalogs of gravitational-wave events. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities in two distinct regimes. First, using simulated catalogs of supermassive black hole binary mergers for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we show that the method accurately recovers complex three-dimensional distributions and absolute merger rates from sparse datasets, effectively correcting for selection effects and measurement uncertainties. Second, we validate the framework on real observational data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog, successfully inferring the population of stellar-mass binary black holes using an injection-based selection effect correction. Our results confirm that the method is robust, scalable, and applicable across different detector sensitivities and source populations.",
Cross submissions,An autoencoder-based surrogate waveform model for quasi-circular binary-black-hole mergers,"Anastasios Theodoropoulos,Nino Villanueva,Osvaldo Gramaxo Freitas,Tiago Fernandes,Solange Nunes,Alejandro Torres-Forne,Jose A. Font,Antonio Onofre,Jose D. Martin-Guerrero",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The generation of accurate waveforms from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a major effort in Gravitational-Wave Astronomy. In recent years, machine-learning-based surrogate models for BBH waveforms have been proposed. Those offer the potential to dramatically accelerate waveform generation while maintaining accuracy competitive with that of traditional waveform approximants. In this work, we investigate the viability of autoencoders as generative models for gravitational-wave signals from quasi-circular BBH mergers. We introduce AESur3dq8, a novel surrogate waveform model based on autoencoders that enables the rapid and accurate construction of large template banks, producing millions of waveforms in under a second using modest computational resources. The model is trained on the numerical-relativity-informed surrogate NRHybSur3dq8 and subsequently fine-tuned using the SXS catalog of BBH simulations. We demonstrate that waveforms generated by AESur3dq8 achieve mismatches of order $10^{-4}$ with respect to Numerical Relativity waveforms, and that parameter estimation performed with these templates yields results fully consistent with those reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration for observed gravitational-wave events.",
Cross submissions,"Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian",Kirill Russkov,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.",
Cross submissions,Running Love Numbers of Charged Black Holes,"Sergio Barbosa,Sylvain Fichet,Lucas de Souza",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Loops of virtual particles from the vacuum of quantum field theory (QFT) render black holes tidally deformable. We compute the static tidal response of unspinning charged black holes at arbitrary radius, using the perturbative formalism developed in2501.18684. Since the gravitational and electromagnetic tidal responses mix, we generalize the notion of Love numbers to Love matrices. We derive the coupled equations of motion for the metric and electromagnetic fluctuations around purely electric and magnetic backgrounds. For large charged black holes, which are described by the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity, we compute the full set of Love matrices induced by an arbitrary tower of $F^{2n}$ operators. We find that, although quantum corrections break electromagnetic duality, the Love matrices in electric and magnetic backgrounds are related by a $Z_2$ symmetry under electric-magnetic exchange. Going beyond EFT, we compute the Love matrices of small magnetic black holes. We show that the running of the Love matrices is governed by the running of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling, and we derive the correspondence between Love and $U(1)$ beta functions for arbitrary harmonics. The overall picture that emerges is that the QFT-induced tidal response of magnetic black holes saturates in the strong-field regime. These results imply that nearly-extremal magnetic black holes charged under an Abelian dark sector could be probed by gravitational-wave observations.",
Cross submissions,Nonperfect Carrollian Fluids Through Holography,Felipe Diaz,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We embed the covariant, gauge-invariant gravitational radiation criteria of Fernández-Álvarez and Senovilla, based in terms of conformal geometry and the Bel-Robinson tensor, into the hydrodynamic framework of gauge/gravity duality. This construction uncovers a direct correspondence between bulk gravitational waves and dissipative processes in the boundary theory, from which a natural notion of entropy production emerges. We further analyze a smooth flat limit in which the dual fluid becomes Carrollian, with dissipation governed by Carroll-covariant tensors. As an example, we apply our framework to the Robinson-Trautman family of solutions.",
Cross submissions,Has Kronos devoured Planet Nine and its epigones?,Lorenzo Iorio,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Space Physics (physics.space-ph),"The Planet Nine hypothesis encompasses a body of about 5-8 Earth's masses whose orbital plane would be inclined to the ecliptic by one or two tens of degrees and whose perihelion distance would be as large as about 240-385 astronomical units. Recently, a couple of his epigones have appeared: Planet X and Planet Y. The former is a sort of minor version of Planet Nine in that all its physical and orbital parameters would be smaller. Instead, the latter would have a mass ranging from that of Mercury to the Earth's one and semimajor axis within 100-200 astronomical units. By using realistic upper bounds for the orbital precessions of Saturn, one can get insights on their position which, for Planet Nine, appears approximately confined around its aphelion. Planet Y can be just a Mercury-sized object at no less than about 125 astronomical units, while Planet X appears to be ruled out. Dedicated data reductions by modeling such perturber(s) are required to check the present conclusions, to be intended as hints of what might be detectable should planetary ephemerides include them. A probe on the same route of Voyager 1 would be perturbed by Planet Nine by about 20-40 km after some decades.",
Cross submissions,A structural criterion for asymptotic states in Supersymmetry,"Stefano Bellucci,Stefania De Matteo",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In quantum field theory, the algebraic existence of a field does not guarantee the existence of a corresponding localized asymptotic particle state. This distinction is well established in the presence of infrared effects, long-range correlations, and environmental interactions, and becomes particularly relevant in supersymmetric theories, where fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom are constrained at the algebraic level but need not share identical asymptotic behavior. In this work we introduce a minimal and predynamical localization criterion that distinguishes algebraically allowed degrees of freedom from those capable of forming stable, phasecoherent asymptotic states. The criterion is formulated in terms of long-time stability under slow structural fluctuations of an effective background, without modifying the underlying field equations or introducing new physical interactions. We show that fermionic and scalar fields respond qualitatively differently to such structural effects. While fermionic modes may retain asymptotic stability, scalar modes generically exhibit decoherence and damping, preventing their interpretation as localized one-particle states. This provides a conservative and model-independent perspective on how supersymmetric algebraic structures may coexist with an asymmetric observable particle spectrum. The analysis is intentionally non-constructive and does not rely on specific supersymmetrybreaking mechanisms, cosmological assumptions, or new dynamical ingredients. Rather, it clarifies localization as an independent structural requirement for particle existence within standard quantum field theory.",
Cross submissions,Replica Phase Transition with Quantum Gravity Corrections,"Jun Nian,Yuan Zhong",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Motivated by bulk replica wormholes, we study the boundary effective theory that describes the near-horizon fluctuations of a near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole. This theory consists of a Schwarzian mode and a $U(1)$ phase mode. We compute the partition function of this boundary theory on replica geometries, from which the entropy is derived. Our analysis reveals a rich phase structure, in which the dominance of connected or disconnected replica configurations leads to a phase transition controlled by the temperature and the coupling constants $C$, $K$, and $\mathcal{E}$ of the 1d effective theory.",
Cross submissions,Black Hole Interior and Quantum Error Correction with Dynamical Gravity,"Akihiro Miyata,Tomonori Ugajin",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"According to the island formula, information in the code subspace defined in the black hole interior is embedded in the Hawking radiation after the Page time. At first sight, this embedding suggests that operations acting on the Hawking radiation could modify the information in the code subspace, potentially leading to an apparent violation of causality. Indeed, in previous studies based on the PSSY model, which incorporates only the topological degrees of freedom of gravity, it was shown that when the error is sufficiently large, a violation of causality can arise, as indicated by a nonvanishing mutual information. In this paper, we investigate the situation in which dynamical gravity also acts on the Hawking radiation. In this case, operations on the Hawking radiation induce nontrivial backreaction on the bulk spacetime appearing in the gravitational path integral for the mutual information -- an effect that is absent when the Hawking radiation is non-gravitating. We find that this backreaction renders the relevant mutual information vanishing. This result implies that, in theories with dynamical gravity, the apparent violation of causality is resolved.",
Cross submissions,Detectability and Model Discriminability of the Dark Ages 21 cm Global Signal,"Shintaro Yoshiura,Fumiya Okamatsu,Tomo Takahashi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen atom is almost the only way to directly probe the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages 21 cm signal, observed at frequencies below 50 MHz, can serve as a powerful probe of cosmology, as the standard cosmological model predicts a well-defined 21 cm spectral shape. In this work, we assess the detectability and model-selection power of 21 cm observations assuming physically motivated foregrounds, optimistic error levels, and several observing strategies for the signals predicted in various cosmological models. Using a Bayesian evidence-based comparison, we find that wide-band observations covering 1-50 MHz can identify the evidence of non-zero 21 cm signals from models considered in this paper except the one with a smooth spectrum that peaks at lower frequencies. In particular, observations below 15 MHz are essential to avoid degeneracies with the foreground. Furthermore, even with observations measured at 5 MHz intervals over the frequency range 1-50 MHz, the 21 cm signal can be identified if the errors are sufficiently small. This indicates that the intrinsic 21 cm spectral shape can be captured without foreground degeneracy even with a limited number of frequency channels.",
Cross submissions,Factorized neural posterior estimation for rapid and reliable inference of parameterized post-Einsteinian deviation parameters in gravitational waves,"Yong-Xin Zhang,Tian-Yang Sun,Chun-Yu Xiong,Song-Tao Liu,Yu-Xin Wang,Shang-Jie Jin,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO has strikingly confirmed general relativity (GR), but testing GR via GWs requires estimating parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) deviation parameters in waveform models. Traditional Bayesian inference methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provide reliable estimates but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, failing to meet the real-time demands and surging data volume of future GW detectors. Here, we propose a factorized neural posterior estimation framework: we construct independent normalizing flow models for each of the nine ppE deviation parameters and effectively integrate prior information from other source parameters via a conditional embedding network. Leveraging a hybrid neural network with a convolutional neural network and a Residual Neural Network for feature extraction, our method performs rapid and statistically reliable posterior inference directly from binary black hole signals. Compared to conventional MCMC, our approach achieves millisecond-scale inference time with a speedup factor of $9 \times 10^4$. Comprehensive validations show that the posterior estimates pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and achieve empirical coverage probabilities close to theoretical targets. This work demonstrates the great potential of deep learning for GW parameter estimation and provides a viable technical solution for real-time GR tests with next-generation detectors.",
Cross submissions,A single field inflationary potential consistent with recent observations,Md. Wali Hossain,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Current observations indicate that an inverse exponential form of the inflaton potential provides an excellent description of single-field inflation. This potential fits the SPA$+$BK$+$DESI data sets well with in the $1\sigma$ bound in the $n_{\rm s}$-$r$ plane, thereby offering a simple and observationally viable single field inflationary scenario. To describe post-inflationary evolution and reheating, we extend the inverse exponential potential by adding a steep exponential term that remains negligible during inflation but becomes important afterwards. The resulting full potential develops a minimum after the end of inflation, leading to oscillations of the scalar field and consequently reheating of the Universe. We find that the maximum reheating temperature attainable in this scenario is of order $10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. The inverse exponential potential therefore emerges as a compelling candidate for early-Universe inflation, combining theoretical simplicity with robust observational viability.",
Cross submissions,Vacuum initial data with minimal decay and borderline decay,"Dawei Shen,Jingbo Wan",Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In this note, we show that the conical solution-operator method of Mao-Tao in [Localized initial data for Einstein equations] applies to a simple construction of vacuum asymptotically flat initial data at minimal and borderline decay thresholds, corresponding to the global and exterior stability of Minkowski spacetime proved by the first named author in [Global stability of Minkowski spacetime with minimal decay] and [Exterior stability of Minkowski spacetime with borderline decay].",
Cross submissions,Shear subdiffusion in non-relativistic holography,"Yan Liu,Zhi-Ling Wang,Xin-Meng Wu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study shear fluctuations in non-relativistic holographic systems coupled to torsional Newton-Cartan geometry, using asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity. We identify a universal subdiffusive shear mode characterized by the quartic dispersion relation $\omega=-iD_4 k^4$, in sharp contrast to the conventional hydrodynamic diffusion. We derive this result analytically through a systematic higher-order matched asymptotic expansion connecting near-horizon and far-region solutions, and we verify it with direct numerical quasinormal mode calculations. Our numerics demonstrate that the first non-hydrodynamic mode is purely imaginary and gapped, following the dispersion relation $\omega=-i\omega_0-i D k^2$, and that both the hydrodynamic and the first non-hydrodynamic modes pass through pole-skipping points. These results highlight Lifshitz holography as an efficient framework for anomalous transport in strongly coupled non-relativistic quantum matter.",
Cross submissions,Universal Relations and Correlation Analysis of Proto-Neutron Star Properties in Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity,Sayantan Ghosh,Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Proto-neutron stars (PNSs) are the hot, lepton-rich remnants of the core collapse supernovae, which go through a cooling phase and become cold, stable Neutron stars (NSs). Since PNSs are also superdense objects with strong gravitational fields, we can use them to probe general relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime, similar to NSs. In this study, we analyze the macroscopic properties like mass, radius, compactness, tidal deformability, $f$-mode oscillations and gravitational binding energy of PNSs using four different relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs) with fixed entropy per baryon ($S$ =1, 2) and varying the lepton fractions ($Y_l$). The variation of $S$ and $Y_l$ has a noticeable effect on these properties. Extending our study beyond GR, we explore these effects within the framework of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG). This modified gravity theory adds the squared energy-momentum terms to the field equations with a free parameter $\alpha$. In the weak-field regimes, EMSG remains indistinguishable from GR, but in the strong-field regimes, such as PNSs or NSs, it shows measurable deviations. Varying the free parameter $\alpha$, we observe significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the PNSs. After that, we focus on the universal relations of the macroscopic properties and the correlations of the universal relations. We find that, despite significant changes in the macroscopic properties induced by the variations of $S$, $Y_l$ and $\alpha$, the correlations remain strong and nearly unaffected.",
Cross submissions,Quantum clock and Newtonian time,"Dorje C. Brody,Lane P. Hughston",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"An extension of standard quantum mechanics is proposed in which the Newtonian time parameter appearing in the unitary evolution operator is replaced with the time shown by a `quantum clock'. A quantum clock is defined by the following properties: (a) the time that the clock shows is non-decreasing, (b) the clock ticks at random with random tick sizes, and (c) on average the clock shows the Newtonian time. We show that the leading term in the evolution equation for the density matrix associated with any quantum clock model gives the von Neumann equation. Modifications to the von Neumann equation are worked out in detail in a parametric family of examples for which the tick sizes have a gamma distribution. The leading correction to the von Neumann equation is given by the Lindblad equation generated by the Hamiltonian, but there are higher-order terms that generalize the von Neumann equation and the Lindblad equation. Lower bounds on the parameters of these quantum clock models are derived by use of the precision limit of an atomic clock.",
Cross submissions,LISA Non-Linear Dynamics and Tilt-To-Length Coupling,"Lavinia Heisenberg,Henri Inchauspé,Sarah Paczkowski,Ricardo Waibel",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"For the LISA mission, Tilt-To-Length (TTL) coupling is expected to be one of the dominant instrumental noise contributions after laser frequency noise is suppressed based, on assumptions on the size of the coupling and angular jitter levels. This work uses for the first time a closed-loop, non-linear, and time-varying dynamics implementation to simulate detailed angular jitters for the spacecraft and optical benches. In turn, this gives an improved expectation of the TTL contribution to the interferometric output. It is shown that the TTL coupling impact is limited given current estimates on the size of coupling coefficients. A time-domain Least Squares estimator is used to infer the TTL parameters from the simulated measurements. The bias and correlations limit the estimator in the case of regular datasets with amplified TTL coefficients to a relative error of $10\%$, but the subtraction of the TTL signal still works well. For lower readout noises, the estimation error diverges, which can be mitigated using a regularization term. Alternatively, using sinusoidal maneuvers improves the inference to a high accuracy of $0.1\%$ for TTL coefficients around the expected level, removing all correlations in the inferred parameters. This validates the maneuver design by Wegener et al. (2025) in this closed-loop setting.",
Cross submissions,Black Hole Evaporation as a Topological Tunneling,Victor H. Alencar,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present the quantization of the electromagnetic field near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole using Euclidean path integrals. Our result for the vacuum energy describes a black hole surrounded by a finite volume of photons at $T_{H} = \frac{1}{8\pi G M}$, the black hole quantum atmosphere. The total entropy includes contributions from this atmosphere, and the Bekenstein entropy, which arises from the Gibbons--Hawking--York boundary term, which encodes topological information. We show that the contribution of the quantum atmosphere to the black hole specific heat is positive, indicating that the system may become thermodynamically stable.By analyzing homology groups, we show that the black hole evaporation is a tunneling between topologically distinct spacetimes: Schwarzschild ($\chi = 2)$ transitions to the flat spacetime ($\chi = 1$) via Hawking radiation, where $\chi$ is the Euler characteristic, a topological invariant. This process resembles instanton-driven tunneling in Yang-Mills theories, where topologically non-trivial solutions dominate the vacuum amplitude. In our case, the Gibbons--Hawking--York term dominates the transition amplitude, which induces the evaporation process. These results corroborate the Parikh-Wilczek picture of Hawking radiation and the interpretation of Euclidean black holes as gravitational instantons.",
