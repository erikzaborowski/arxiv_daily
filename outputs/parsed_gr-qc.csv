New submissions,Static AdS Black Holes Surrounded by Strings and Quintessence-like Field within Rastall Gravity Framework,"Allan. R. P. Moreira,Faizuddin Ahmed,Abdelmalek Bouzenada",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we tested the physical properties of Rastall black holes in the presence of string clouds and quintessence. The modified spacetime geometry arising from the Rastall framework is first established, providing the basis for analyzing the geodesic structure. We study null geodesics in detail, testing photon trajectories, the conditions for photon spheres, BH shadows, the associated effective radial force, and the topological features of photon rings. Also, the analysis is further tested to timelike geodesics, where we investigate the motion of massive particles and determine the innermost stable circular orbits. In this case, we discuss the thermodynamic behavior of the system, show the effects of Rastall gravity, strings, and quintessence on the BHs stability and thermal characteristics. In this context, our results improve and show of how modifications to general relativity and surrounding matter distributions influence both the dynamical and thermodynamical aspects of BHs.",
New submissions,General form of $f(R)$ and $(2+1)$-dimensional charge/non-charge black hole solutions,G.G.L. Nashed,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We introduce novel black hole (BH) solutions, charge/non-charge, within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that does not inherently include a cosmological constant, using equal/diffirent metric ansatzs. Remarkably, these solutions exhibit asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) or de Sitter (dS) behavior, depending on their parameter values. Unlike the BTZ solutions of General Relativity, which feature a causal singularity and constant scalar invariants, our solutions display strong spacetime singularities, as shown by their scalar invariants. We construct $f(R)$ functions that behave as polynomial functions, emphasizing the unique nature of these solutions. We demonstrate the stability of these solutions in two ways: first, by showing that their heat capacity is positive, which ensures thermodynamic stability; and second, by proving that the second derivative of $f(R)$ is positive, meeting the Ostrogradski criterion for dynamical stability. Furthermore, the solutions satisfy the first law of thermodynamics, confirming their consistency with fundamental thermodynamic principles.",
New submissions,On the formation of gravastars,"Daniel Jampolski,Luciano Rezzolla",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Regular black holes and horizonless black-hole mimickers offer mathematically consistent alternatives to address the challenges posed by standard black holes. However, the formation mechanism of these alternative objects is still largely unclear and constitutes a significant open problem since understanding their dynamical formation represents a first step to assess their existence. We here investigate, for the first time and without invoking deviations from general relativity, the dynamical formation of a well-known horizonless black-hole mimicker, namely, a gravastar. More specifically, starting from the collapse of a uniform dust sphere as in the case of the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, a gravastar can form from the nucleation and expansion of a de-Sitter region with initial zero size at the center of the collapsing sphere. Furthermore, the de-Sitter expansion naturally slows down near the Schwarzschild radius, where it meets the collapsing dust surface and gives rise to a static equilibrium. Interestingly, we also find a maximum initial compactness of the collapsing star of $\mathcal{C}= 3/8$, above which the collapse to a black hole is inevitable.",
New submissions,Neutron star evolution with BDNK viscous hydrodynamics framework,"Harry L. H. Shum,Fernando Abalos,Yago Bea,Miguel Bezares,Pau Figueras,Carlos Palenzuela",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"The recently proposed first-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics formulation by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (commonly known as the BDNK formulation) has been shown to be causal, stable, strongly hyperbolic, and thus locally well-posed. It is now a viable new option for modelling out-of-equilibrium effects in fluids, and has attracted wide attention in its potential applications to astrophysical systems. In this work, we present the first non-linear numerical simulation of spherically symmetric neutron stars using the BDNK formulation under the Cowling approximation. Using a simplified equation of state, we show that stable evolutions can be constructed within a restricted parameter space up to the simulation time we explored. From these simulations, we analyse the frequency content of the quasi-normal modes and the decay rate of the fundamental mode. This analysis serves as a first step towards constructing a fully consistent model of neutron stars using the BDNK formulation.",
New submissions,On Scalar Cosmological Perturbations in Non-Minimally Coupled Weyl Connection Gravity,"M. Lima,C. Gomes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze a theory with non-minimal matter-curvature coupling, considering non-metricity properties with a Weyl connection. This model has the advantage of an extra force term which can mimic dark matter and dark energy, and simultaneously follow Weyl's idea to unify gravity and electromagnetism. Indeed, Schwarzschild-like and Reissner-Nordstrom-like black hole solutions exist in this model, leading to new features, such as an additional horizon, due to the non-metricity vector. We derive the cosmological field equations, considering a minimal coupling, and discuss preliminary results on the scalar cosmological perturbations in this model.",
New submissions,Singularity and differentiability at the origin of regular black holes,"Tommaso Antonelli,Marco Sebastianutti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The divergence of curvature invariants at a given point signals the incompleteness of the spacetime, and the derivative order of these diverging invariants determines the differentiability class of the considered spacetime. We hereby focus on a general static and spherically symmetric geometry and determine, in the full non-linear regime and in a model independent way, the conditions that the metric functions must satisfy in order to achieve regularity at the origin. This work is structured around a central theorem, which relates the regularity of the spacetime at the origin to the parity of the metric functions. The detailed proof of this theorem constitutes the main result of the paper.",
New submissions,Constraining the rotating Simpson-Visser spacetime from the observed quasi-periodic oscillations in black holes,"Anirban Dasgupta,Indrani Banerjee",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Regular black holes (BHs) which are singularity-free alternatives to the standard black hole paradigm in General Relativity (GR), offer effective models for probing the interface between classical and quantum gravity. They serve as promising candidates for exploring the nature of strong gravity and potential extensions of GR by providing testing grounds to understand how quantum corrections might manifest in astrophysical black holes. In the present work, we investigate the regular BH scenario described by the Simpson-Visser (SV) spacetime and explore its imprints on the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the black hole power spectrum. The Simpson-Visser spacetime represent the simplest, globally regular extensions of the Schwarzschild scenario, through the presence of a regularizing parameter. We explore the imprints of the regularizing parameter on the orbital and epicyclic frequencies associated with the motion of test particles in the rotating SV spacetime. Models aimed to explain the observed HFQPOs often invoke these fundamental frequencies and hence can potentially constrain the regularizing parameter from the available HFQPO data. We test eleven well-established HFQPO models against available observations from six black hole sources, obtaining spin constraints that, when compared with previous independent estimates, help identify the observationally favored models for each source. Based on the present data, we report that the observationally favored models cannot discriminate between the Kerr and the Simpson-Visser scenario. This when coupled with the large discrepancy in previous spin estimates of these sources, may plausibly indicate some deviation from GR in the strong gravity regime near BHs which requires further investigation.",
New submissions,Theory space and stability analysis of General Relativistic cosmological solutions in modified gravity,"Saikat Chakraborty,Piyabut Burikham",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Some aspects of two General Relativistic cosmological solutions, an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ ($j$ is cosmographic jerk parameter), and a specifically designed toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ ($q$ is cosmographic deceleration parameter, $0<|\varepsilon|<1$) that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario as suggested by DESI DR2, are studied within the context of $f(R)$ gravity, by portraying them as a \emph{flow} in the 2-dimensional \emph{theory space} spanned by the quantities $r=\frac{R f'}{f}, m=\frac{R f''}{f'}$. For the $f(R)$ theories exactly reproducing a background $\Lambda$CDM-like expansion history $j=1$, it is shown by means of a \emph{cosmographic} reconstruction approach that the curvature degree of freedom need not necessarily behave like an effective cosmological constant, and that cosmologies under different possible such theories lead to different possible values of $\Omega_{m0}$. With the theory space analysis, it is also shown that $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(R)$ cosmologies that asymptote to General Relativistic $\Lambda$CDM in the limit $q\to1/2$, are prone to instability under small homogeneous and isotropic perturbation, casting a doubt on achieving an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ within $f(R)$ gravity. Regarding the toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario, it is shown that possible underlying $f(R)$ theories that admit it as a solution are inevitably plagued by tachyonic instability ($f''(R)<0$). All the above physically interesting conclusions are derived without explicitly reconstructing, even numerically, the functional form of the underlying $f(R)$, which demonstrates the edge of the $r$-$m$ theory space analysis over the traditional explicit reconstruction approach.",
New submissions,The Weyl Geometric Gravity black hole in light of the Solar System tests,"Mohsen Khodadi,Tiberiu Harko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The Weyl geometric gravity theory, in which the gravitational action is constructed from the square of the Weyl curvature scalar and the strength of the Weyl vector, has been intensively investigated recently. The theory admits a scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field equations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As compared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution contains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate, respectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and obtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole at the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general relativity (gravitational redshift, the Eötvös parameter and the universality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion precession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo delay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be fully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic tests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution.",
New submissions,Charged Rotating Casimir Wormholes,"Remo Garattini,Athanasios G. Tzikas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the conditions necessary for the existence of a rotating traversable wormhole by introducing a Casimir source and an external electric field. A viable wormhole solution emerges when the rotation is constant, corresponding to that of an observer in a zero angular momentum frame. Furthermore, a radially dependent rotation is also a feasible solution, provided the angular velocity decreases exponentially as one moves away from the throat.",
New submissions,Proper-Time Approach in Asymptotic Safety via Black Hole Quasinormal Modes and Grey-body Factors,"Bekir Can Lütfüoğlu,Erdinç Ulaş Saka,Abubakir Shermatov,Javlon Rayimbaev,Inomjon Ibragimov,Sokhibjan Muminov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the quasinormal mode spectrum and grey-body factors of black holes in an effectively quantum-corrected spacetime, focusing on the influence of near-horizon modifications on observable quantities. Employing scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields, we analyze the perturbation equations and extract the fundamental quasinormal frequencies using both the 6th-order WKB method with Padé resummation and time-domain integration. Our results show that quantum corrections near the horizon significantly affect the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes, particularly for low multipole numbers and in the near-extremal regime. We also verify the robustness of the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors by comparing WKB results with those reconstructed from the dominant quasinormal modes. Across all field types and parameter ranges considered, the WKB method proves accurate within a few percent, confirming its reliability in probing the impact of near-horizon physics. These findings support the use of quasinormal ringing and Hawking radiation spectra as sensitive tools for testing quantum modifications of black hole spacetimes.",
New submissions,Grey-Body Factors for Scalar and Dirac Fields in the Euler-Heisenberg Electrodynamics,Zainab Malik,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study grey-body factors of neutral scalar and Dirac fields in the background of charged black holes arising in the Einstein--Euler--Heisenberg (EEH) theory. The Euler--Heisenberg corrections, which represent nonlinear electrodynamical effects due to vacuum polarization, modify the effective potential barrier surrounding the black hole and thereby affect the transmission probabilities for Hawking quanta. Using the sixth-order WKB method, and verifying our results against the recently proposed correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes, we compute the frequency-dependent grey-body spectra for various values of the black hole charge and EEH coupling. We find that the nonlinear coupling systematically lowers the effective potential barrier, enhancing the transmission probability. This work represents the first step toward incorporating nonlinear QED effects into the study of Hawking evaporation, focusing here on neutral test fields.",
Cross submissions,Simultaneous Speedmeter and Position-Meter Response in a Single Tabletop Interferometer,"Mikhail Korobko,Xiang Li,Torben Sobottke,Yiqiu Ma,Yanbei Chen,Roman Schnabel",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"Quantum radiation-pressure noise (QRPN) limits the low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors. The established method for suppressing QRPN is the injection of frequency-dependent squeezed light. It requires long-baseline filter cavities introducing substantial experimental complexity. A completely different interferometer concept is the speedmeter. It avoids QRPN at the source by measuring test mass speed instead of position. While extensively researched theoretically, speedmeters are yet to be demonstrated with a moving test mass in an optomechanical setting. In this work, we present the first experimental observation of speedmeter behavior in a system with a movable test mass. We realize a novel hybrid readout cavity configuration that enables simultaneous extraction of position and speed signals from two distinct output ports. We compare the optical transfer functions associated with each channel and observe the expected scaling behavior that distinguishes a speedmeter from a position-meter. We support our observations with a detailed theoretical model, showing how the hybrid readout cavity implements key speedmeter features. Our results underscore the relevance of the speedmeter concept as an alternative for mitigating QRPN in future detectors and lay the groundwork for further experimental exploration.",
Cross submissions,Living on the edge: a non-perturbative resolution to the negativity of bulk entropies,"Stefano Antonini,Luca V. Iliesiu,Pratik Rath,Patrick Tran",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Lin, Maldacena, Rozenberg, and Shan (LMRS) presented a new information paradox in black hole physics by noticing that the entanglement and Rényi entropies in a two-sided black hole can become negative when the geometry contains a very large number of matter excitations behind the black hole horizon. While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS two-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact persists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large number of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and Rényi entropies in ordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a necessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of black holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement negativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more general non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral. We then interpret this result from the point of view of a dual matrix integral, which we use to extend our analysis beyond the regime of validity of the genus re-summation performed in the gravitational path integral. In this regime, positivity is rescued by new saddles of the matrix integral, a one-eigenvalue instanton and a two-eigenvalue instanton. Finally, we formulate a similar puzzle and its resolution using random tensor network techniques.",
Cross submissions,Potential for Lunar Interior Science by the Gravitational-Wave Detector LILA,"Mark P. Panning,Philippe Lognonné,Teviet Creighton,James Trippe,Volker Quetschke,Josipa Majstrorović,Karan Jani",Geophysics (physics.geo-ph); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), a concept for measuring sub-Hz gravitational waves on the Moon, would use laser strainmeters to obtain extremely sensitive strain measurements from 1 mHz to 1 Hz. With proposed strain sensitivities, LILA would also be able to measure the normal modes of the Moon from 1-10 mHz at high signal-to-noise ratio. Such measurements would enable significant advances in our understanding of both the spherically symmetric and even 3D deep internal structure of the Moon. Strainmeter measurements may even be able to detect the translational mode of the solid inner core of the Moon at frequencies below 0.1 mHz. Inertial seismometers, on the other hand, are unlikely to reach the performance of $\sim10^{-16}$ m/s$^2$/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ required to reliably detect normal modes below 5-10 mHz, even with optimistic assumptions on future projected performance.",
Cross submissions,Collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores leading to a black hole and a massive disk as a source of gravitational waves,"Masaru Shibata,Sho Fujibayashi",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We derive models of rotating very massive stellar cores with mass $\approx 10^2$--$10^4M_\odot$ which are marginally stable to the pair-unstable collapse, assuming that the core is isentropic and composed primarily of oxygen. It is shown that the cores with mass $\lesssim 10^3M_\odot$ can form a massive disk with the mass more than 10% of the core mass around the formed black hole if the core is rotating with more than 30% of the Keplerian limit. We also indicate that the formation of rapidly spinning massive black holes such as the black holes of GW231123 naturally accompanies the massive disk formation. By using the result of our previous study which showed that the massive disk is unstable to the non-axisymmetric deformation, we predict the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves and show that the collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores can be a promising source of gravitational waves for Einstein Telescope. The detection of such gravitational waves will provide us with important information about a formation process of intermediate mass black holes.",
Cross submissions,Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory,"Kazuya Mameda,Naoki Yamamoto",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.",
Cross submissions,Detecting milli-Hz gravitational waves with optical resonators,"G. Barontini,X. Calmet,V. Guarrera,A. Smith,A. Vecchio",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph),"We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.",
Cross submissions,Dualities in Physics,"Sebastian De Haro,Enrico Cinti",History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"For more than half a century, dualities have been at the heart of modern physics. From quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum gravity, dualities have proven useful in solving problems that are otherwise quite intractable. Being surprising and unexpected, dualities have been taken to raise philosophical questions about the nature and formulation of scientific theories, scientific realism, emergence, symmetries, explanation, understanding, and theory construction. This book discusses what dualities are, gives a selection of examples, explores the themes and roles that make dualities interesting, and highlights their most salient types. It aims to be an entry point into discussions of dualities in both physics and philosophy. The philosophical discussion emphasises three main topics: whether duals are theoretically equivalent, the view of scientific theories that is suggested by dualities (namely, a geometric view of theories), and the compatibility between duality and emergence.",
Cross submissions,$η_{\rm w}$-meson from topological properties of the electroweak vacuum,"Gia Dvali,Archil Kobakhidze,Otari Sakhelashvili",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We further scrutinize the evidence for a recently suggested pseudo-scalar particle, the electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson. Its existence is demanded by matching the removal of the weak vacuum angle $\theta_{\rm w}$ by the anomalous $B+L$ - symmetry with a massive pole in the topological susceptibility of the vacuum. We specifically focus on the possibility of the emergence of $\eta_{\rm w}$ as a collective excitation of the phase of the condensate of the 't Hooft fermion determinant, generated by the electroweak instantons, which breaks the $B+L$ - symmetry spontaneously. We argue that the generation of the 't Hooft vertex is in one-to-one correspondence with its non-zero vacuum expectation value which is cutoff insensitive. We outline certain puzzles about the nature of the emergent $\eta_{\rm w}$ which require further investigations.",
Cross submissions,Analytic derivation of GW spectrum from bubble collisions in FLRW Universe,Masaki Yamada,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We generalize the analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum from bubble collisions during a cosmological first-order phase transition, under the thin-wall and envelope approximations, by incorporating the effect of cosmic expansion in the FLRW metric. Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the flat-spacetime limit. The latter expansion reveals that the flat-spacetime approximation breaks down for $\beta / H_* \lesssim 10$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion. Furthermore, the next-to-leading-order term contributes about a $10\%$ correction for $\beta / H_* \sim 140$, a typical value for the electroweak phase transition.",
Cross submissions,Dynamical Similarity in Multisymplectic Field Theory,"Callum Bell,David Sloan",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformations may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends this symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories described within the covariant De-Donder Weyl formalism. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are discussed; in the former case, the Lagrangian is introduced as a bundle morphism $\mathcal{L}:J^1E\rightarrow\wedge^mM$, whilst the Hamiltonian description takes as its multiphase space the restricted multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$. The contact reduction process is implemented in a number of particular cases, and it is found that the geometry of the reduced space admits an elegant physical interpretation.",
Cross submissions,Frequency shifts due to relativistic effects and retardation in continuous variable quantum key distribution,"Emanuel Schlake,Jan P. Hackstein,Roy Barzel,Eva Hackmann,Dennis Rätzel,Claus Lämmerzahl",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Space-based quantum communication naturally involves satellites and ground stations exchanging optical signals at high altitudes and large relative velocities. Starting from general relativistic considerations, we systematically separate the frequency shift into longitudinal Doppler contributions, relativistic corrections, and corrections from the propagation delay (retardation). We find the relativistic corrections to the Keplerian satellite orbits to be negligible on the considered timescale, compared to the gravitational and special relativistic time dilation contributions to the frequency shift. Somewhat surprisingly, we find the contribution from the retardation effect to be on the same order of magnitude as the relativistic contributions. To analyze the significance of these effects, we investigate secret key rates for a continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol for various configurations of satellite orbits and ground stations. We find that the corrections from relativistic effects and retardation significantly impact the communication performance and should be taken into account.",
Cross submissions,Quantum Properties of Non-Dirichlet Boundary Conditions in Gravity,"Patrick Draper,Manthos Karydas,Hao Zhang",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Euclidean path integral for gravity is enriched by the addition of boundaries, which provide useful probes of thermodynamic properties. Common boundary conditions include Dirichlet conditions on the boundary induced metric; microcanonical conditions, which refers to fixing some components of the Brown-York boundary stress tensor; and conformal conditions, in which the conformal structure of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are fixed. Boundaries also present interesting problems of consistency. The Dirichlet problem is known, under various (and generally different) conditions, to be inconsistent with perturbative quantization of graviton fluctuations; to exhibit thermodynamic instability; or to require infinite fine-tuning in the presence of matter fluctuations. We extend some of these results to other boundary conditions. We find that similarly to the Dirichlet problem, the graviton fluctuation operator is not elliptic with microcanonical boundaries, and the non-elliptic modes correspond to ``boundary-moving diffeomorphisms."" However, we argue that microcanonical factorization of path integrals -- essentially, the insertion of microcanonical constraints on two-sided surfaces in the bulk -- is not affected by the same issues of ellipticity. We also show that for a variety of matter field boundary conditions, matter fluctuations renormalize the gravitational bulk and boundary terms differently, so that the classical microcanonical or conformal variational problems are not preserved unless an infinite fine-tuning is performed.",
