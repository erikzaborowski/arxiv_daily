New submissions,Letelier black hole immersed in an electromagnetic universe,"Ahmad Al-Badawi,Faizuddin Ahmed,İzzet Sakallı",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings and immersed in an electromagnetic universe. By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-\alpha)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order.",
New submissions,Enhanced energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in Kerr-AdS spacetime,"Bo Zhao,Chao-Hui Wang,Shao-Wen Wei",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we study the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes following the magnetic reconnection process. The parameter space regions that satisfy the energy extraction condition, as well as the efficiency and power of the extracted energy, are analyzed. The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts. Our results highlight the crucial role of the cosmological constant in energy extraction via magnetic reconnection.",
New submissions,More on the relativistic images produced in gravitational lensing,"Angelika Ghazale,Oliver F. Piattella",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the gravitational lensing properties and the formation of relativistic images associated with black holes modeled by the Reissner-Nordström and Kerr space-time geometries. In particular, we perform numerical computations of the deflection angles, image angular positions, magnification factors (including demagnification), and time delays between distinct images, and we systematically quantify the dependence of these observables on the electric charge and spin parameters of the black hole.",
New submissions,Radiation reaction force for scalar-tensor theories in effective-one-body formalism,"Tamanna Jain,Piero Rettegno",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Whilst most of the binary configurations in modified theories of gravity are studied under quasi-circular orbit limit, eccentricity effects could play a significant role in future gravitational wave detections. We derive the gravitational radiation-reaction force for nonspinning eccentric orbits within the effective-one-body (EOB) description for the massless scalar-tensor theories up to 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The effects in such theories start at $1/c^3$ and interestingly, the 1.5PN order effect is due to the radiation reaction square effects which is a conservative effect. The results derived here can be implemented in the quasi-circular EOB-based waveform models to construct waveform templates for generic orbit binaries within massless scalar-tensor theories of gravity.",
New submissions,Asymptotic charges of a quadrupolar naked singularity,"Edgar Gasperin,Mariem Magdy",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The purpose of this article is to compute the asymptotic charges of a vacuum solution to the Einstein field equations describing a naked singularity with a non-vanishing quadrupole moment, known in the literature as the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime (q-metric). In addition to the well-known asymptotic quantities such as the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum, the BMS charges and NP constants of this spacetime are computed. Explicit calculations of the latter are relatively scarce in the literature. Moreover, it has been proven that the NP constants of asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and algebraically special spacetimes vanish (for instance, those of the Kerr spacetime). A by-product of the present analysis is to show that the algebraically special condition in the aforementioned result appears to be crucial, since the q-metric provides a counterexample to the conjecture that all asymptotically flat, stationary, vacuum, and asymptotically algebraically special spacetimes (a weaker version of the algebraically special condition) have vanishing NP constants.",
New submissions,Probing the Scalar Hair of Rotating Horndeski Black Holes through Thick Disk Images,"Qian Wan,Yehui Hou,Minyong Guo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Horizon-scale images of black holes provide a potential probe of fundamental physics, including tests of gravity and black hole hair. To assess the impact of scalar hair on accretion-flow imaging self-consistently, we construct an analytical model of a geometrically thick, magnetized disk around a rotating hairy black hole in Horndeski theory and analyze its 230 GHz image morphology. We find that scalar hair modestly alters the inflow and magnetic-field structure but strengthens gravitational redshift, markedly reducing the total flux and lensed ring brightness through relativistic transfer and spectral-shift effects. Moreover, we highlight a previously unexplored channel: the maximum interferometric diameter of the first photon ring responds strongly to the hair parameter but shows little dependence on accretion-flow details, making it a promising observable for constraining black-hole hair with future space-based interferometry.",
New submissions,Non-singular cosmologies matching regular black holes,"Shulan Li,Jian-Pin Wu,Xian-Hui Ge",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We construct a new non-singular cosmological model matched to a Minkowski-core regular black hole by means of a modified Oppenheimer--Snyder framework. Its dynamics is studied in both dust-only and scalar-field scenarios, and compared with that of two other non-singular models as well as the classical standard cosmology. The results show that, although all three non-singular cosmologies share identical late-time behavior and allow for a natural embedding of inflation in the scalar-field setting, they exhibit qualitatively distinct non-singular features at very early times. In particular, the new cosmology approaches Minkowski spacetime in the limits of both the infinite past and the infinite future, thereby manifesting an intriguing symmetry between the two asymptotic regimes.",
New submissions,Hamiltonian gravity with fermions,Erick I. Duque,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Fermions are coupled to the Einstein-Cartan system in the canonical formulation, including the cosmological, the Barbero-Immirzi, and the non-minimal coupling constants. The resulting ten first-class constraints generate gauge transformations that are on-shell equivalent to spacetime diffeomorphisms and SL(2,C) transformations. The gravitational second-class constraints receive fermionic contributions, which can be implemented by use of Dirac brackets or by solving them directly. Furthermore, we identify new fermionic (second-class) constraints that are necessary to recover the Dirac-fermion theory by relating the momenta to the configuration variables on dynamical solutions; this fermionic phase-space reduction is accomplished by use of corresponding Dirac brackets. The theory remains well-defined off the second-class constraint surfaces with ten additional degrees of freedom - six of which are gravitational and the remaining four are fermionic. Discrete (CPT) symmetries as well as implications for canonical quantization and modified theories of gravity with fermions are discussed.",
New submissions,Geometric Constraints on Quantum Gravity-Inspired Dispersion Relations,Gines R. Perez Teruel,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Modified dispersion relations (MDRs) arise in many quantum-gravity approaches, often in non-polynomial or non-analytic form beyond the reach of effective field theory (EFT). Logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs appear in causal set theory, nonlocal gravity and $\kappa$-Poincaré models, while Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) yields polymeric (sine), holonomy, inverse-triad and semiclassical corrections. Using the geometric framework of Ref.~\cite{GRP}, we analyse the intrinsic curvature of the associated energy--momentum surfaces, where negative curvature ensures hyperbolic and stable propagation, and curvature sign changes or critical points indicate kinematical instabilities or new invariant scales. We apply this method exhaustively to all major MDRs derived in LQG and find that they remain strictly hyperbolic in the entire phenomenologically relevant regime, with no elliptic patches or critical branching. The same framework provides universal constraints on representative logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric MDRs beyond EFT. Thus, geometric criteria yield a unified and coordinate-independent assessment of stability, thresholds and invariant scales, and demonstrate the robustness of MDRs emerging from LQG.",
New submissions,Ideal Fluids In Born-Infeld Inspired Gravity,J. Kluson,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),In this short note we study Born-Infeld Inspired Gravity together with an action functional for ideal fluid. We obtain corresponding equations of motion and also determine canonical form of this action.,
New submissions,Computing nonlinearity ratios using second order black hole perturbation theory,"Jasveer Singh,Vardarajan Suneeta",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We revisit an analytical approximation scheme for computing nonlinearity ratios involving quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs). We compute these ratios for the general case when the QQNM is not one of the linear QNMs, for the $(l,m)$ channel $(2,2) \times (2,2) \to (4,4)$. We find an excellent match with numerical simulations. We also discuss where and why the method can fail, for example, for the channel $(2,0) \times (2,0) \to (2,0)$ where we can only get crude estimates for the nonlinearity ratio. Motivated by recent studies on nonlinear ringdown at the horizon, we also compute the nonlinearity ratios at the horizon. We find that the ratio both at the horizon and infinity is insensitive to different choices of regularization of the source term in the second order perturbations. We also discuss amplitudes of QQNMs sourced by linear overtones. Finally, we discuss the issues that must be resolved within this method to do precision analysis of nonlinear ringdown.",
New submissions,Gravitational scattering of solitonic boson stars: Analytics vs Numerics,"Thibault Damour,Tamanna Jain,Ulrich Sperhake",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the scattering of boson-star binaries, taking into account three effects: point-mass gravitational, tidal, and short-range scalar-field interactions. We compare analytic results to the scattering angle extracted from four sequences of numerical-relativity simulations at fixed energy and varying impact parameter. The very good agreement exhibits the attractive (repulsive) effect of in-phase (out-of-phase) binaries, wich dominates at small impact parameters. We thus obtain the first effective-one-body potential, central for the construction of analytic gravitational-wave templates.",
New submissions,Realistic classical charge from an asymmetric wormhole,"Vladimir Dzhunushaliev,Vladimir Folomeev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Within Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory, we consider a wormhole solution supported by a complex non-phantom spinor field with a bare mass of the order of the Planck mass (which provides a nontrivial spacetime topology and an intrinsic angular momentum), an electric field (which provides a charge of the system), and a magnetic field. This solution describes an asymmetric wormhole connecting two different asymptotically flat spacetimes (two universes) in which there are in general different observed masses and charges. It is shown that, by suitably adjusting the values of free system parameters, at one end of the wormhole, one can obtain the values of the observed mass and charge typical of the Standard Model particles, whereas at the other end of the wormhole these physical quantities acquire the Planck values. Such a configuration incarnates Wheeler's idea of ``mass without mass'' and ``charge without charge'', and can be thought of as a model of a classical charge possessing a spin.",
New submissions,Imprints of Dark Matter on the Shadow and Polarization Images of a Black Hole Illuminated by Various Thick Disks,"Muhammad Israr Aslam,Rabia Saleem,Chen-Yu Yang,Xiao-Xiong Zeng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Based on two distinct thick accretion flow disk models, such as a phenomenological RIAF-like model and an analytical Hou disk model, we investigate the impact of relevant parameters on the visual characteristics of the Schwarzschild black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). We impose a general relativistic radiative transfer equation to determine the synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. In the RIAF-like model, we notice that the corresponding photon ring and central dark region are expanded with the aid of the PFDM parameter $\eta$, with brightness asymmetries originating at higher inclination angles and closely tied to flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The fundamental difference between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that anisotropy introduces vertical distortions in the higher-order images, resulting in an elliptical appearance. For the Hou disk model, the observed images produce narrower rings and dark interiors, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and changes with the variations of the inclination angle and PFDM parameter $\eta$, which reflects the spacetime signature. All these results indicate that the observed intensity and polarization characteristics in the framework of thick disk models may serve as valuable probes of underlying spacetime geometry and the accretion-dynamics close to the horizon.",
New submissions,Kiselev Black Holes in Anti-de Sitter Spacetime Are Not Viable,"Jiayi Xia,Yen Chin Ong",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"While the Kiselev black hole solution does not describe a perfect fluid quintessence, it is possible that dark energy fluid is not isotropic, and so one may hope that the solution may still describe at least locally a black hole embedded in such a dark energy fluid environment. Taking into account that the accelerated expansion of the Universe is caused by a dynamical dark energy fluid, and the actual underlying cosmological constant is negative as has been sometimes suggested, we show that the Kiselev solution is untenable as it is unstable against brane nucleation instability.",
New submissions,A comprehensive analysis of Barrow holographic Chaplygin gas model reconstruction and its cosmological consequences,"Sanjeeda Sultana,Chayan Ranjit,Surajit Chattopadhyay",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the current study, we have reconstructed variable modified Chaplygin gas in the Barrow holographic dark energy framework motivated by many recent studies. We have validated the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the reconstructed model. The permissible values of the reconstructed model have been determined by the recent astrophysical and cosmological observational data. The Hubble parameter is presented in terms of the observable parameters and redshift $z$ and other model parameters. From the Stern data set and joint data set of Stern with BAO and CMB observations, the bounds of the model parameters $(B_{0}, \Omega_{bhd0})$ are obtained by the $\chi^{2}$ minimization procedure. The best-fit value of the distance modulus $\mu(z)$ against redshift $z$ is obtained for the reconstructed model and it is consistent with the SNe Ia union2 sample data.",
New submissions,Accretion of Generalized Chaplygin Gas onto Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes,"Luis F. Reis,Mario C. Baldiotti,Orfeu Bertolami",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the accretion of cosmic dark fluids, responsible for driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, onto cosmologically coupled black holes. More specifically, we focus on the accretion of the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG). To incorporate the global features of the GCG into this analysis, we employ the McVittie metric, which describes a black hole embedded in an expanding cosmological background. Within this framework, accretion is studied while consistently accounting for the backreaction on the metric components. Using a perturbative approach, we derive an expression for the effective black hole mass and for the evolution of both the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons under accretion. The analysis is performed in two distinct cosmological regimes: first, a matter-dominated era, and subsequently, a de Sitter era. In both cases, it is possible to determine analytically the instant in which accretion begins. For the matter-dominated era, the analytical expression shows that the greater the amount of matter available for accretion, the longer the accretion takes to start.",
New submissions,A Model-Independent Framework for Gravitational-Wave Reconstruction of Binary Black Hole Hyperbolic Encounters in Ground-Based Interferometers,"Peter Lott,Heleen Amedi,Jay Graves,Yeong-Bok Bae,Margaret Millhouse,Laura Cadonati",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Binary black hole hyperbolic encounters represent a dynamical interaction in which two black holes undergo a close fly-by, emitting gravitational-wave bremsstrahlung in the form of a short-duration, single-cycle transient. These events are expected to occur in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters and both active and quiescent galactic nuclei. In this work, we constrain the detection sensitivity for hyperbolic encounters of black hole pairs with a range of asymmetric masses. We employ BayesWave, a wavelet-based morphology-independent algorithm to characterize hyperbolic encounter waveforms in simulated detector noise; for this study, we explore the use of exponential shapelets. We find that a typical hyperbolic orbit with total mass $20 M_{\odot}$ can be detected up to distance $d_L \sim 40 - 200$ Mpc, and we forecast the possibility of detection by ground-based current and future gravitational wave interferometers.",
New submissions,Consistent Regularization of Signature-Changing BTZ Black Holes,Farzad Milani,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Spacetime singularities pose a fundamental challenge to classical and quantum gravity. We develop a mathematically consistent framework for signature-changing black holes by revisiting the $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ metric, which undergoes a Lorentzian-to-Euclidean transition at the horizon. We identify and resolve a critical inconsistency in previous regularization schemes concerning second-order distributional terms $\varepsilon''(r)$, introducing a \emph{modified Hadamard regularization} that is rigorously defined within distribution theory. This yields a vacuum solution without surface layers or impulsive waves. Geodesic analysis shows that infalling observers require infinite proper time to reach the horizon, and curvature remains finite everywhere. Furthermore, we establish the physical viability of the solution by proving its linear stability, demonstrating consistent quantum scalar field propagation across the horizon, and reinterpreting the $r=0$ singularity as a removable topological boundary. Our work places signature change and the associated \emph{atemporality} on a solid foundation as a robust mechanism for singularity resolution.",
New submissions,Gravitational Memory Effect in the Massless Vector Field,"Pouneh Safarzadeh Ilkhchi,Amin Rezaei Akbarieh,Shaoqi Hou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze the infrared structure and memory effects of a massless vector tensor theory with non minimal curvature coupling in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Using Bondi Sachs expansions, we identify the independent radiative data and derive the effective Bondi mass aspect, whose balance law receives an additional positive definite flux from the vector sector. This leads to modified displacement, spin, and center of mass memory (CM) expressions, where the gravitational contributions retain their General Relativity (GR) form and the vector field enters only through well defined flux terms. We also describe persistent vector memory effects associated with the leading angular vector mode, which are gauge invariant but do not affect the leading tidal observables. The BMS transformations act kinematically as in GR. Tensor vacua remain supertranslation degenerate, whereas the vector vacuum, defined by the vanishing vector field, is nondegenerate. All results reduce continuously to GR when the coupling is removed, isolating the precise channels through which vector curvature interactions modify the infrared dynamics.",
New submissions,Some considerations on BEC analogue black holes,"Roberto Balbinot,Alessandro Fabbri",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, dedicated to the memory of A. Aurilia, we will review some basic features of Hawking's black hole radiation and compare them with the corresponding ones present in Bose-Einstein condensate analogue black holes.",
New submissions,Horizon Data: Existence Results and a Near-Horizon Equation on General Null Hypersurfaces,"Miguel Manzano,Marc Mars",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g)$, a horizon is a null hypersurface where the deformation tensor $\mathcal{K}:=£_{\eta}g$ of a null and tangent vector $\eta$ satisfies certain restrictions. In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \textit{$\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation"" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $\Lambda$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section.",
New submissions,"Gravitational lensing inside and outside of a marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits",Naoki Tsukamoto,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It is believed that rays bent inside and outside photon spheres could affect partially the black hole shadow images by the Event Horizon Telescope and the rays near photon spheres would be detected by near-future space observations. The features of the rays near the photon spheres in not only black hole spacetimes but also exotic spacetimes would be important since one will need them to exclude black-hole mimickers. The deflection angles of the rays deflected by photon spheres diverge logarithmically and we can treat them by a strong-deflection-limit analysis. The error of the strong-deflection-limit analysis becomes large if antiphoton spheres exist in the spacetimes and the analysis breaks down when the photon spheres and the antiphoton spheres degenerate to form a marginally unstable photon sphere. This is because the deflection angles of the rays bent by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverge in powers. In this paper, we extend Eiroa, Romero, and Torres's method to gravitational lensing of rays inside and outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits and we apply it to a Reissner-Nordström spacetime and a Hayward spacetime with the marginally unstable photon sphere. We have also confirmed that the deflection angles in the strong deflection limits by the method converge correctly to the deflection angle without approximations, while there are the mismatches of the coefficient of the power-divergent term of the deflection angles of the rays deflected just outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a semi-analytic calculation by the author previously.",
New submissions,Quasinormal modes of Reissner-Nordström-AdS black holes under physical field-vanishing boundary conditions,"Hui-Fa Liu,Qi Su,Ding-fang Zeng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Boundary conditions play a key role in determining the perturbation behavior of a black hole. Motivated by two guiding principles for single-field perturbations -- the non-deformation of the boundary metric and the vanishing of electromagnetic energy flux at the AdS boundary -- we impose a boundary condition for Reissner-Nordström-AdS (RN-AdS) black holes requiring both the metric and electromagnetic field-strength perturbations to vanish at the AdS boundary, which we term the physical field-vanishing (PFV) condition. Using the formulas for perturbation reconstruction, we translate the PFV condition into boundary conditions on the master functions: Dirichlet-type for odd-parity modes and Robin-type for even-parity modes. With these boundary conditions, we compute the quasinormal frequencies of RN-AdS black holes and identify new spectral features. The PFV prescription introduced here could be applied to other multifield perturbation systems in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.",
New submissions,Stellar Objects From Quantum Gravity,"Salvatore Samuele Sirletti,Piero Nicolini,Mariafelicia De Laurentis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper explores the theoretical implications of quantum gravity by analyzing compact stellar objects, presenting three distinct models that serve as alternatives to traditional black holes. These models are characterized by their extreme compactness and incorporation of a quantum core, successfully avoiding the curvature singularities typically associated with classical general relativity. Central to these models is the noncommutative parameter, which plays a crucial role in determining stellar properties and enables the exploration of various astrophysical regimes. While pure Planckian effects pose significant challenges for observational detection, our findings suggest that lower energy scales may reveal exotic stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses that lack classical counterparts, potentially providing the first experimental evidence of non-classical gravity. We propose that the metrics derived in this study can be tested against known neutron stars, offering promising avenues for future research aimed at understanding the interplay between quantum effects in gravity and stellar evolution, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of the universe's fundamental properties.",
New submissions,Search for Peak Structures in the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1-O4a Datasets,"Catalina-Ana Miritescu,Mario Martinez,Oriol Pujolas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a dedicated search for gravitational-wave backgrounds with nontrivial peak structures using data from the first three and the initial part of the fourth observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. The analysis is motivated by a variety of early-Universe models characterized by signals with multiple peaks. We introduce a model independent parameterization of double-peaked spectra based on the superposition of two normalized broken power laws and perform a Bayesian inference study using the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA isotropic cross-correlation data. While no statistically significant evidence for a multi-peak background is found, the analysis provides constraints on the inter-peak slopes in correlation with the signal amplitude. These results exhibit LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's ability to probe signals beyond a single peak structure and establish a foundation for future targeted searches for nontrivial gravitational waves background spectral shapes in future observing runs and the advanced detector era.",
New submissions,Cauchy data for multiple collapsing boson stars,"Elena Giorgi,Dawei Shen,Jingbo Wan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"We construct Cauchy initial data for the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon (EMKG) system, which evolves in finite time into spacetimes containing multiple trapped surfaces. From a physical perspective, this corresponds to preparing multiple well-separated boson stars, each of which collapses to form a spacelike black hole region. In particular, this extends the result of the second and third named authors on the formation of multiple trapped surfaces in vacuum to the EMKG system.",
New submissions,On extremal black holes,"Chiara Coviello,Ruth Gregory",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We take a fresh look at the viability of physically realistic extremal black holes within our (non-supersymmetric) low energy physics. By incorporating prefactors and volume effects, we show that Schwinger discharge in charge neutral environments is far more efficient than commonly assumed. Using ionization estimates for neutral hydrogen, we obtain a new and robust lower bound on the mass of an extremal electrically charged black hole, exceeding $10^{14} M_\odot$. For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible. Finally, we suggest that an extremal Kerr black hole could shed angular momentum via superradiant scattering from the stochastic gravitational wave background. Taken together, our results provide a unified picture that extremal black holes of any type are unlikely to persist in our universe.",
New submissions,Explicit and universal formula for thermodynamic volume in extended black hole thermodynamics,"Yong Xiao,Yu-Xiao Liu,Yu Tian,Hongbao Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In extended black hole thermodynamics, the cosmological constant and other couplings are treated as thermodynamic variables, yielding a first law $\tilde{\delta}M=T\tilde{\delta}S+\Omega\tilde{\delta}J+\mathcal{V}\tilde{\delta}P+\cdots$, where $P\equiv -\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi}$. A long-standing conceptual gap in this framework is that, unlike $M$, $T$, $S$, $\Omega$, and $J$, the thermodynamic volume $\mathcal{V}$ lacks a first-principles definition and can only be deduced from other thermodynamic quantities. This deficiency indicates that the underlying origin of $\mathcal{V}$ has remained poorly understood. In this work, we resolve this issue and provide an explicit universal formula for $\mathcal{V}$. We demonstrate that it universally decomposes into two contributions, one arising from the explicit dependence of the action on the couplings and the other from the response of the fundamental dynamical fields. This clarifies the physical meaning of thermodynamic volume and places it on the same footing as other intrinsic thermodynamic quantities.",
New submissions,No Love for black holes: tightest constraints on tidal Love numbers of black holes from GW250114,"M. Andrés-Carcasona,G. Caneva Santoro",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Tidal Love numbers of black holes, zero in classical general relativity for Kerr black holes in vacuum, become non-vanishing in the presence of exotic matter or in alternative theories of gravity, making them a powerful probe of fundamental physics. The gravitational-wave event GW250114, observed with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio, provides a unique opportunity to test this prediction. By analyzing this event, we conclude that the data is consistent with the binary black hole hypothesis, and we place a 90\% upper limit on the effective tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} < 34.8$. These bounds imply that any environment surrounding the black holes must contribute less than $\sim 7\times 10^{-3}$ of their mass, and they rule out some models of boson stars. Our findings provide the strongest observational constraints yet on black hole tidal deformability and show that the data remain fully consistent with the Kerr black hole prediction of vanishing tidal Love numbers.",
New submissions,Quantum Recoherence in Presence of Excited States in the Early Universe,"Mattia Cielo,Simone Scarlatella,Gianpiero Mangano,Ofelia Pisanti,Louis Hamaide",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the quantum-to-classical transition of primordial perturbations within a two-field inflationary framework where an adiabatic mode interacts with an entropic environment. In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum. This sensitivity to initial conditions highlights the non-generic nature of full recoherence in the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations.",
Cross submissions,Spatial Phonons: A Phenomenological Viscous Dark Energy Model for DESI,Muhammad Ghulam Khuwajah Khan,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore a phenomenological model of dark energy in which space is treated as an elastic brane with uniform tension $T_s$ supporting a longitudinal phonon fluid. The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $\phi^I$ and an invariant $b = \sqrt{\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\kappa$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = \kappa/\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $\tau(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $H\tau(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \sim H_\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $\Lambda$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $\kappa \ \simeq \ \varepsilon \ \simeq \ 1/3$ and $H_\star/H_0 \ \simeq \ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements.",
Cross submissions,General-Relativistic Path Effects and the Local Hubble Expansion,Said Laaroua,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop an effective mapping for low-redshift photon propagation that captures the leading path-dependent deviations from the standard FLRW redshift. Instead of relying on exact integrations of the Sachs optical equations, we introduce a minimal deformation of the redshift relation z_eff(z) = z minus alpha times f(z), where alpha is a small amplitude and f(z) suppresses the correction at z greater than approximately 0.1. This mapping does not modify the background expansion but encapsulates the leading contribution of inhomogeneous tidal fields to the accumulated Sachs redshift. We derive the implications for the luminosity distance, the low-redshift Hubble relation, and the directional dependence associated with local structure. The framework provides a clean general-relativistic description of path-dependent redshift drift and yields concrete predictions for forthcoming low-redshift surveys.",
Cross submissions,Cosmology of Gravi-Axions,"Stephon Alexander,Gregory Gabadadze,Leah Jenks,Nicolás Yunes",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We show how a mass term for gravitational axions (''gravi-axions'') with a Chern-Simons coupling to gravity can naturally arise due to non-perturbative contributions from Euclidean wormholes, breaking the continuous shift symmetry of the standard theory. The induced mass can be generated in a cosmologically relevant range to be the dark matter or dark energy of the universe for a reasonable and well-motivated range of the symmetry breaking scale. Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory. Finally, we find that, for late-time, astrophysical compact objects, cosmologically relevant gravi-axions behave as minimally-coupled, massive scalar fields.",
Cross submissions,Finite Gauss-Sum Modular Kernels: Scalar Gap and a Pure AdS$_3$ Gravity No-Go Theorem,Miguel Tierz,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We obtain closed-form expressions for the $ST^nS$ modular kernels of non-rational Virasoro CFTs and use them to construct fully analytic modular-bootstrap functionals. At rational width $\tau$, the Mordell integrals in these kernels reduce to finite quadratic Gauss sums of $\operatorname{sech}/\sec$ profiles with explicit Weil phases, furnishing a canonical finite-dimensional real basis for spectral kernels. From this basis we build finite-support ""window"" functionals with $\Phi(0)=1$ and $\Phi(p)>0$ on a prescribed low-momentum interval. Applied to the scalar channel of the $ST^1S$ kernel, these functionals yield a rigorous analytic bound on the spinless gap. As a second application we prove an analytic no-go theorem for pure AdS$_3$ gravity: no compact, unitary, Virasoro-only CFT$_2$ can have a primary gap above $\Delta_{\rm BTZ}=(c-1)/12$, because a strictly positive ""Mordell surplus"" in the odd-spin $ST$ kernel forces an odd-spin primary below $\Delta_{\rm BTZ}$.",
Cross submissions,Existence and bounds of nonlinear singularity-free cosmological solutions in a string-inspired gravity,"Chihang He,Chao Liu",Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We provide a rigorous proof for the existence of homogeneous, isotropic and globally singularity-free cosmological solutions in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity with exponential coupling. While numerical studies suggested such solutions exist, a formal proof remained elusive. By employing a novel ``power identity method'' and overcoming significant challenges posed by the strong nonlinearities of the exponential coupling, which are not present in the quadratic coupling analyzed in our companion paper \cite{he2025proofssingularityfreesolutionsscalarization}, we establish a FLRW solution valid for all time $t\in(-\infty,+\infty)$, where the Hubble parameter remains positive and vanishes asymptotically, while the scalar field evolves monotonically. This result align with numerical simulations and offer a firm mathematical foundation for singularity-free cosmology in a string-inspired setting.",
Cross submissions,Instability thresholds for de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes in holographic semiclassical gravity,"Akihiro Ishibashi,Kengo Maeda,Takashi Okamura",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the stability of $d$-dimensional ($d=3,4,5$) de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity sourced by a strongly coupled quantum field with a gravity dual. Our stability results are derived from a careful analysis of the $d$-dimensional Lichnerowicz equation with mass-squared $m^2$ and of semiclassical equations involving the dimensionless parameter $\gamma_d$. For $d=3$, we find that Minkowski spacetime is always unstable against perturbations, whereas de Sitter spacetime becomes stable when a dimensionless parameter $\gamma_3$ exceeds a critical value. In $d=4$, both de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes become unstable when the parameter $\gamma_4$ exceeds its critical value. In contrast, in $d=5$, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes remain stable for almost all values of the parameter $\gamma_5$, except for a regime in which higher-curvature corrections become comparable to the Einstein tensor.",
Cross submissions,Constraints on Chiral-Quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 and impact on unifying dark energy with inflation,"Andronikos Paliathanasis,Tommaso Mengoni,Genly Leon,Orlando Luongo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The recent data release DR2 from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has reinforced compelling evidence supporting the dynamical nature of dark energy. In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics.",
Cross submissions,Probing a minimal dark gauge sector via microlensing of compact dark objects,"Juan Barranco,Argelia Bernal,Víctor Jaramillo,Darío Núñez,Milton Ruiz",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We introduce a minimal Dark Standard Model (DSM) consisting of a single spin-0 particle with dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and completely decoupled from the visible sector. Characterized only by the scalar mass $\mu$ and the dark charge $q$, this framework naturally gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including stable solitonic configurations that behave as dark ""mini-MACHOs"". We numerically build and evolve these gauged scalar-field solitons, derive their mass-radius relations, and identify a critical charge beyond which no gravitationally bound configurations exist. By combining these results with microlensing surveys that exclude compact objects heavier than the asteroid-mass scale ($M\lesssim 10^{-11}M_\odot$), we obtain the constraint $\mu\gtrsim 10\,\rm eV$ for viable configurations, depending on $q$. Our results represent a step forward in showing that purely gravitational observations can constrain the internal parameters of a dark gauge sector, and provide a framework for exploring broader DSM scenarios through future probes such as gravitational wave detections.",
Cross submissions,No boundary density matrix in elliptic de Sitter dS/$\mathbb{Z}_2$,"Raphaël Dulac,Zixia Wei",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Elliptic de Sitter (dS) spacetime dS$/\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a non-time-orientable spacetime obtained by imposing an antipodal identification to global dS. Unlike QFT on global dS, whose vacuum state can be prepared by a no-boundary Euclidean path integral, the Euclidean elliptic dS does not define a wavefunction in the usual sense. We propose instead that the path integral on the Euclidean elliptic dS defines a no-boundary density matrix. As an explicit example, we study the free Dirac fermion CFT in two-dimensional elliptic dS and analytically compute the von Neumann and the Rényi entropies of this density matrix. The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT. We also comment on a striking feature of free QFT in elliptic dS: its global Hilbert space is one-dimensional, wheres the Hilbert space associated to each observer is a nontrivial Fock space.",
Cross submissions,Images of shadow and thin accretion disk around Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter,"Haiyuan Feng,Ziqiang Cai,Hao-Peng Yan,Rong-Jia Yang,Jinjun Zhang",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigated the shadow and optical appearance of Bardeen black hole (BH) immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter (PFDM). Using the EHT data, we find that the DM parameter is restricted to a narrow allowed range, confined to values of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$. Additionally, we observed that increasing the DM parameter substantially enlarges the photon sphere, the critical impact parameter, and thus the shadow radius, whereas the magnetic charge $g$ produces only negligible corrections. The DM component also modifies the optical appearance of the accretion disk: higher $b$ systematically suppresses the observed radiation intensity and reduces image brightness, while changes in $g$ yield only marginal effects. Subsequently, using the Novikov-Thorne thin disk model, we analyze primary and secondary images, observed flux, and redshift patterns, showing that PFDM noticeably alters image size and brightness whereas magnetic charge has a negligible influence. No blueshifted regions appear in any configuration. These results highlight several promising observational signatures for testing DM environments and nonlinear electrodynamic effects around BHs.",
Cross submissions,Nonlinear Orbital Variations in Binary Radio Pulsars from Lense-Thirring Precession,Emmanuel Fonseca,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A future measurement of Lense-Thirring (LT) precession using a binary radio pulsar is expected to yield the pulsar's moment of inertia ($I_{\rm p}$). However, most of the known pulsar-binary systems expected to provide this opportunity will exhibit linear variations in the orbital elements due to LT precession that are difficult to separate from variations induced by other mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that the pulsar-timing signature of LT precession for an arbitrary orbital orientation produces nonlinear orbital variations; if detected, these nonlinear variations provide a means to constrain $I_{\rm p}$ without the need for timing-independent measurements of orbital geometry or distance. We show through simulations that these signatures are indeed detectable in pulsar-binary systems with an appropriate combination of timing precision and orbital geometry. Our simulations also show that nonlinear orbital variations from LT precession are expected to be detectable in PSR J1757$-$1854 after only 15 yr of dedicated timing.",
Cross submissions,AdS gravastar and its signatures from dual conformal field theory,"Heng-Yu Chen,Yasuaki Hikida,Yasutaka Koga",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Quantum gravity effects are expected to resolve the black hole singularity and the effects may deform the region near but outside the horizon. Applying AdS/CFT correspondence, we see their signatures from the viewpoint of dual conformal field theory. As a regularized geometry, we consider AdS gravastar constructed by gluing AdS-Schwarzschild and de Sitter spacetime. The retarded Green functions of dual conformal field theory have bulk-cone singularities associated with null trajectories in the bulk and we obtain the singularities specific to a horizon-less geometry. We also observe echoes coming from waves reflected behind the photon sphere. The existence of echoes implies the modification of geometry inside the photon sphere.",
Cross submissions,Asymptotic Weyl Symmetry and Its Anomaly in a Curved Spacetime,"Jeongwon Ho,O-Kab Kwon,Sang-A Park,Sang-Heon Yi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore an unusual symmetry in a field theory on a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime, which has an interesting interpretation as an approximate asymptotic Weyl symmetry. Unlike the conventional Weyl symmetry, the boundary term under the variation plays a crucial role in understanding for its anomaly. After converting a two-dimensional field theory on curved spacetime to an inhomogeneous field theory, we obtain the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor. Then, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect in the bubble wall expansion at the zero temperature.",

Most,Anima Anandkumar",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Modeling how supermassive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies is notoriously hard because the relevant physics spans nine orders of magnitude in scale-from milliparsecs to megaparsecs--making end-to-end first-principles simulation infeasible. To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors.",

Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram. By resolving degeneracies with 3-dimensional Mass-Radius-Pressure diagrams, we provide a complete topological view of the ensemble. This work supplies a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting multi-messenger astronomical observations and constraining the properties of dark matter.",

Our derivations apply to general multi-fluid cases, and here we take dark matter admixed neutron star models for example, demonstrating a stability boundary distinct from the single-fluid case. Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars. This group includes twin stars with identical masses and radii but different interior structures. These results can help interpret compact star observations and constrain dark matter properties through astrophysics.",
Cross submissions,Towards a complete description of multiple D$p$-brane systems: Multiple D$0$ Story,Unai D.M. Sarraga,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In this thesis, we address the problem of constructing the complete supersymmetric description of systems of $N$ nearly coincident Dirichlet $p$-branes (multiple D$p$-brane or mD$p$). A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $\kappa$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory.",

One field of particular interest that these particles can be used to investigate is quantum mechanics. Previous research has yet to set an absolute upper bound on the size of objects that can be prepared in a quantum superposition. Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics. We shall cover the scientific motivation behind these investigations, then summarize the current status of our designs for the satellite. We will then review the aspects of the payload that require further development, then summarize the current estimates of the payload's requirements.",
