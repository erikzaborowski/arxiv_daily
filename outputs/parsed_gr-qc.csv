New submissions,Gravitational wave cosmology : an introduction,"Grégoire Pierra,Simone Mastrogiovanni",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"This chapter introduces gravitational wave cosmology, focusing on the use of gravitational waves as standard sirens to probe the expansion history of the Universe. It presents and explains the methodologies behind bright and dark siren analyses, including their respective data requirements and underlying assumptions. Particular attention is given to the theoretical foundations of these approaches, the statistical frameworks used to interpret gravitational-wave events, and the treatment of selection effects. Examples and applications are provided for each method, with the aim of offering a clear and accessible introduction to the tools and concepts enabling cosmological inference from gravitational-wave observations.",
New submissions,"Large scale structure constraints and matter power spectrum in $f (Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity","Praveen Kumar Dhankar,Albert Munyeshyaka,Saddam Hussain,Tom Mutabazi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the present work, we take into account the dynamical system analysis to investigate the matter power spectrum within the framework of the $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravitational theory. After obtaining autonomous dynamical system variables for two different particular pedagogical choices of $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ models (A and B), we derive the full system of perturbation equations using the $1+3$ covariant formalism to study the matter fluctuations. We present and solve the energy density perturbation equations to obtain the energy density contrast, which decays with redshift for both models for a particular choice of model parameters. After obtaining the numerical results of the density contrast, we computed the matter spectra for each model and conducted a comparative analysis with the $\Lambda$CDM. Furthermore, by employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis,the model parameters were constrained using a combination of different observational data sets to improve the robustness and accuracy of the parameter estimation. Our results indicate that only model A can be compatible with the considered observational data sets.",
New submissions,Relativistic and Dynamical Love,"Abhishek Hegade K. R.,K.J. Kwon,Tejaswi Venumadhav,Hang Yu,Nicolás Yunes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"Gravitational waves emitted in the late inspiral of binary neutron stars are affected by their tidal deformation. We study the tidal dynamics in full general relativity through matched-asymptotic expansions and prove that the dynamical tidal response can be expanded in a complete set of modes. We further prove that the mode amplitudes satisfy an effective, forced harmonic oscillator equation, which generalizes the overlap-integral formulation of Newtonian gravity. Our relativistic treatment of dynamical tides will avoid systematic biases in future gravitational-wave parameter estimation.",
New submissions,Twisting inflation to sub-Planckian axion decay constants,"Peter Adshead,Suddhasattwa Brahma,Indranil Das",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study pseudoscalar inflation in the Einstein-Cartan-Palatini (first-order) formulation of gravity while allowing for torsion. We introduce two non-minimal interactions in the gravitational sector: pseudoscalar couplings to the Pontryagin density (Chern-Simons term) and the Nieh-Yan topological invariant. In the presence of these terms, the rolling pseudoscalar sources non-trivial torsional fields during inflation. We show that pathological gradient and ghost instabilities limit the strength of the coupling to the Pontryagin density during inflation. Furthermore, we show that the interaction with the Nieh-Yan term induces a new contribution to the pseudoscalar kinetic term, which parametrically increases its decay constant and allows for inflation on steep potentials. The torsion field generated by the background is parity violating, which is manifest in the resulting chiral gravitational wave spectrum. We find that the scalar sector is largely unaffected beyond the remapping of the axion decay constant to a larger value. Consequently, we show that while natural inflation with a cosine potential remains inconsistent with observations, the squared quartic hilltop potential can be made consistent with Planck 2018 data even for sub-Planckian decay constants by coupling to the Nieh-Yan term.",
New submissions,Causal structure and topology change in (2+1)-dimensional simplicial gravity,"Seth K. Asante,Björn Borgolte",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We develop a systematic method for analyzing the causal structure at vertices in (2+1)-dimensional Lorentzian simplicial gravity. By examining the intersection patterns of lightcones emanating from a vertex with its simplicial neighbourhood, we identify 13 distinct causal types of Lorentzian tetrahedra-excluding configurations with null faces. This forms the basis for a topological classification of the local causal structure in terms of the number of connected spacelike and timelike regions on the triangulated 2-sphere surrounding the vertex. These local causal data allow us to identify regular causal structures and new types of causal irregular configurations, generalizing well-known (1+1)-dimensional topologies, such as `Trousers' and `Yarmulkes', to higher dimensions.We further investigate the dynamical implications of vertex causality by analyzing the behaviour of deficit angles and the Regge action in explicit configurations. Transitions in vertex causal structure coincide with singularities in the curvature and action, suggesting discrete topology change. Causally irregular hinges correspond to discrete conical singularities, while vertex causal irregularities manifest as point-like singularities. Interestingly, we find that vertex and hinge causality are generally independent. These results have direct implications for discrete quantum gravity approaches where the emergence of semiclassical spacetime depends on how causal structures are encoded within the triangulation.",
New submissions,"Geodesics, Scalar Fields, and GUP-Corrected Thermodynamics of Charged BTZ-like Black Holes in Bopp-Podolsky Electrodynamics","Faizuddin Ahmed,Ahmad Al-Badawi,Abdelmalek Bouzenada,Erdem Sucu,İzzet Sakallı",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In Ref. [1], the spacetime geometry generated by compact objects in $(2+1)$-dimensional Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics is derived. Using a perturbative approach, the authors derived a charged BTZ-like black hole solution and computed corrections up to second order in a perturbative expansion valid far from the horizon. In this work, we investigate the same circularly symmetric three-dimensional charged BH solution pierced by disclinations. We begin by analyzing the motion of photons within this spacetime, focusing on how the geometric parameters influence the effective potential governing null geodesic motion. The corresponding equations of motion are derived, and the resulting orbital dynamics are explored through graphical methods to show the influence of key parameters including the BH mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, cosmological constant $\Lambda$, and BP coupling parameter $b^2$. Extending our analysis to wave dynamics, we examine the propagation of massless scalar fields in the BH solution by solving the Klein-Gordon equation. Through suitable coordinate transformations, we derive a Schrödinger-like equation with an effective potential that encodes the influence of the topological defect and electromagnetic corrections. Additionally, we investigate quantum gravitational effects by applying the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) to derive a GUP-corrected Hawking temperature, revealing systematic suppression of thermal radiation that could lead to stable BH remnants. Finally, we compute Keplerian frequencies for circular orbits, demonstrating how the interplay between charge, nonlinear electrodynamics, and disclination parameters creates distinctive observational signatures that could potentially test modified gravity theories in strong-field regimes.",
New submissions,Fokker-Planck equation for the Brownian motion in the post-Newtonian approximation,Gilberto M. Kremer,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech),"A mixture of light-gas particles and Brownian heavy particles is analyzed within the framework of a post-Newtonian Boltzmann equation to determine the Fokker-Planck equation for the Brownian motion. For each species, the equilibrium distribution function refers to the corresponding post-Newtonian Maxwell-Jüttner distribution function. The expressions for the friction viscous coefficient in the first and second post-Newtonian approximations are determined, and we show their dependence on the corresponding gravitational potentials. A linear stability analysis in the Newtonian and post-Newtonian Fokker-Planck equations for the Brownian motion is developed, where the perturbations are assumed to be plane harmonic waves of small amplitudes. From a dispersion relation it follows that: (i) for perturbation wavelengths smaller than the Jeans wavelength two propagating modes -- corresponding to harmonic waves in opposite directions -- and one mode that does not propagate show up; (ii) for perturbation wavelengths bigger than the Jeans wavelength the time evolution of the perturbation corresponds to a growth or a decay and the one which grows refers to the instability.",
New submissions,Thermal scalar field stress tensor on a two dimensional black hole and its near horizon properties,"Saurav Samanta,Bibhas Ranjan Majhi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We calculate the thermal renormalized energy-momentum tensor components of a massless scalar field, leading to trace anomaly, on a $(1+1)$ dimensional static black hole spacetime. Using these, the energy density and flux, seen by both static and freely-falling observers, are evaluated. Interestingly for both these observers the aforementioned quantities in Unruh and Boulware vacua are finite at the horizon when the scalar field is in thermal equilibrium with the horizon temperature (given by the Hawking expression). Whereas in Hartle-Hawking vacuum both the observers see finite energy-density and flux at the horizon, irrespective of the value of field temperature. Particularly in the case of Schwarzschild spacetime, a freely falling observer finds its initial critical position $r^c_i = (3/2)r_H$, where $r_H$ is the horizon radius for which energy-density vanishes.",
New submissions,Recent Advances in Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis,"Bo Liang,He Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.",
New submissions,The fault in our sirens: Hierarchical diagnosis of waveform systematics in Hubble-Lêmaitre constant measurements,"Arnab Dhani,Jonathan Gair,Alessandra Buonanno",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmological inference using a population of binary black-hole mergers, combined with a galaxy catalog, presents an exciting opportunity for precision cosmology with the possibility of resolving the Hubble tension. However, the accuracy of these measurements heavily relies on the quality of the model used to infer the binary parameters, including the model of the gravitational-wave signal. We use state-of-the-art waveform models to explore the impact of inaccurate modeling in measuring the Hubble-Lêmaitre constant for the upcoming and future ground-based gravitational-wave observatories. We diagnose the presence of inaccuracies within a hierarchical population-analysis framework, without a priori knowing the true value of the parameter, by assessing the consistency of the distribution of individual posteriors in relation to their measurement errors. Our findings indicate that even a small high-mass, spin-precessing subpopulation -- comprising as little as 5\% of the population generating the events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration so far -- can result in an unreliable measurement of the Hubble-Lêmaitre constant in the upcoming observing runs of these detectors, with even more pronounced effects expected in future facilities on the ground.",
New submissions,Quantum modified inertia: an application to galaxy rotation curves,Jonathan Gillot,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study explores the field of modified inertia through a novel model involving maximal and minimal acceleration bounds. A principle of dynamics is developed within special relativity and has direct implications in astrophysics, especially for galaxy rotation curves. The presence of a minimal acceleration significantly reduces the amount of dark matter required to account for these curves. The model presented here is however conceptually different from fiduciary Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). The modified inertia with the minimal acceleration bound closely matches with many observed galaxy rotation curves and the radial acceleration relation, showing a better agreement than MOND in the $10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ regime. Additionally, the minimal acceleration is predicted to evolve with redshift.",
New submissions,Gravitational wave propagation in bigravity in the late universe,"David Brizuela,Marco de Cesare,Araceli Soler Oficial",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We carry out a detailed analytical investigation of the propagation of gravitational waves in bimetric gravity in a late-time de Sitter epoch. In this regime, the dynamical equations for the massless and massive graviton modes can be decoupled and solved exactly. We provide uniform approximations for the modes in terms of elementary functions, which are valid on all scales and for all viable mass windows. We identify different dynamical regimes for the system, depending on the propagation properties of the massive graviton, and whether the massless and massive components of the signal can be temporally resolved or not. In each regime, we compute the gravitational-wave luminosity distance as a function of redshift and study the propagation of wave packets. Further, by an explicit computation, we show that the massless and massive components of the signal retain their coherence also in the regime where they can be temporally resolved, even when couplings to incoherent matter degrees of freedom are included.",
Cross submissions,The Baby Universe is Fine and the CFT Knows It: On Holography for Closed Universes,"Stefano Antonini,Pratik Rath,Martin Sasieta,Brian Swingle,Alejandro Vilar López",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Big bang/big crunch closed universes can be realized in AdS/CFT, even though they lack asymptotically AdS boundaries. With enough bulk entanglement, the bulk Hilbert space of a closed universe can be holographically encoded in the CFT. We clarify the relation of this encoding to observer-clone proposals and refute recent arguments about the breakdown of semiclassical physics in such spaces. In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks down. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space represents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the quantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed on observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT nevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed universe in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of a final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary between the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the emergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final state projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed universe, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant description of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data, and it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an example of one such observable. Taken together, these results amount to a clean bill of health for baby universes born of AdS/CFT.",
Cross submissions,A Black Hole Airy Tail,"Stefano Antonini,Luca V. Iliesiu,Pratik Rath,Patrick Tran",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the annealed entropy differs from the quenched entropy at low temperatures and goes negative. However, computing the quenched entropy in JT gravity requires a replica limit that is poorly understood. To circumvent this, we define an intermediate quantity called the semi-quenched entropy, which has the positivity properties of the quenched entropy, while requiring a much simpler replica trick. We compute this in JT gravity in different regimes using i) a bulk calculation involving wormholes corresponding to the Airy limit of the dual matrix integral and ii) a boundary calculation involving one-eigenvalue instantons, demonstrating consistency between these two calculations in their common regime of validity. We also clarify why a recent attempt to compute the quenched entropy using one-eigenvalue instantons is unreliable due to a breakdown of the saddle-point approximation for the one-eigenvalue instanton in the replica limit.",
Cross submissions,Orbit method for Quantum Corner Symmetries,"Giulio Neri,Ludovic Varrin",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The classification of the unitary irreducible representations of symmetry groups is a cornerstone of modern quantum physics, as it provides the fundamental building blocks for constructing the Hilbert spaces of theories admitting these symmetries. In the context of gravitational theories, several arguments point towards the existence of a universal symmetry group associated with corners, whose structure is the same for every diffeomorphism-invariant theory in any dimension.Recently, the representations of the maximal central extension of this group in the two-dimensional case have been classified using purely algebraic techniques. In this work, we present a complementary and independent derivation based on Kirillov's orbit method.We study the coadjoint orbits of the group $\widetilde{\mathrm{SL}}(2,\mathbb{R})\ltimes\mathbb{H}_3$, where $\mathbb{H}_3$ is the Heisenberg group of a quantum particle in one dimension. Our main result is that, despite the non-abelian nature of the normal subgroup in the semidirect product, these orbits admit a simple description. In a coordinate system associated with modified Lie algebra generators, the orbits factorize into a product of coadjoint orbits of $\mathrm{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)$ and $\mathbb{H}_3$. The subsequent geometric quantization of these factorized orbits successfully reproduces the known representations.",
Cross submissions,Vanishing Metric Commutation Relation and Higher-derivative De Donder Gauge in Quadratic Gravity,Ichiro Oda,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that the equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs) among the time derivatives of the metric tensor identically vanish in the higher-derivative de Donder gauge as well as the conventional de Donder gauge (or harmonic gauge) for general coordinate invariance in the manifestly covariant canonical operator formalism of quadratic gravity. These ETCRs provide us with the vanishing four-dimensional commutation relation, which implies that the metric tensor behaves as if it were not a quantum operator but a classical field. In this case, the micro-causality is valid at least for the metric tensor in an obvious manner. This fact might be a manifestation of renormalizability of quadratic gravity in case of the canonical operator formalism.",
Cross submissions,Phenomenological Scaling Relations for SQM Stars with a Massive s-Quark in Gravitationally Strong Magnetic Fields under the Spherical Symmetry Approximation,"Łukasz Bratek,Joanna Jałocha,Marek Kutschera",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"Scaling relations with the bag constant parameter are investigated for Strange Quark Matter (SQM) stars in the presence of gravitationally strong magnetic fields minimally coupled with matter, considering both massless and massive strange quark scenarios. Assuming a simple model for such coupling under the approximation of spherical symmetry, a phenomenological scaling formula for the maximum mass of stars is derived as a function of the surface magnetic field and the strange quark mass. This formula is applicable for all formally admissible values of the free parameters, and strict scaling with the bag constant is retained only for a vanishing strange quark mass.As a byproduct of this study, the mathematical structure of the equation of state for the relativistic SQM model with a massive strange quark is revisited without approximations. It is observed that the contribution of the electron term to the energy density cannot be neglected in the theoretical limit of large strange quark masses. Consequently, the maximum mass of SQM stars increases with sufficiently large strange quark mass, contrasting with the behavior observed for low strange quark masses.",
Cross submissions,Magnetic Monopoles: Theoretical Insights into the Cosmic Ray Conundrum,"Łukasz Bratek,Joanna Jałocha",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Ultra-high energy (UHE) photons above 10^{18} eV serve as valuable probes of fundamental physics. While typically produced in interactions involving charged particles, they could also originate from exotic sources such as annihilations of magnetically charged monopole-antimonopole pairs or decays of highly accelerated monopoles (10^{21} eV). Detecting such photons would impose constraints on monopole properties. Despite strong theoretical motivations and extensive experimental searches, no monopoles have been observed to date. A possible explanation beyond high monopole masses arises from Staruszkiewicz's quantum theory of infrared electromagnetic fields. His argument, rooted in the positivity of the Hilbert space norm, suggests that isolated magnetic monopoles may not be physically realizable. If correct, this would imply that while monopoles remain mathematically well-defined within field theories, only magnetically neutral configurations could exist in nature.",
Cross submissions,Hawking time crystal,"Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova,Fernando Sols",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Optics (physics.optics),"We report the numerical observation of a time crystal in a quantum black-hole laser (BHL), where the genuine spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time correlations are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic version of the Andreev-Hawking effect, signaled by anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions.",
Cross submissions,Charged Particle Oscillations around a Black Hole Surrounded by CDM Halos,"Zakaria Ahal,Hasan El Moumni,Karima Masmar",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"HF QPOs are among the most intriguing phenomena observed in LMXBs containing BHs or neutron stars. In this work, we investigate charged particles' dynamics in the nearby of a Schwarzschild-like BH embedded in a uniform magnetic field and surrounded on all sides by CDM. Thereby gaining deeper insight into the influence of magnetic and DM distributions on observable phenomena near compact objects. We first present a modified metric, which incorporates the effects of a CDM ...We compute the fundamental oscillation frequencies-radial, latitudinal, Keplerian, and Larmor-and demonstrate how their variation depends on the combined influence of CDM and magnetic field strength. The resulting frequency structure allows us to identify resonance radii associated with HF QPOs, particularly those in 3:2 ratios observed in microquasars. We assess several theoretical models for QPO generation, including the (ER), Relativistic Precession (RP), Tidal Disruption (TD), and Warped Disk (WD) models. A comparative fit of observational data from GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, XTE 1550-564, and GRO 1655-40 demonstrate that the TD and WD models provide the best match for HF QPOs in the presence of moderate magnetic flux ($B' = 0.1$), while the other models except ER fit better in weak-field scenarios.Our results highlight the importance of including both magnetic and dark matter (DM) effects in strong-field astrophysics and support the use of HF QPOs as sensitive probes of BH environments. This study opens new perspectives for exploring particle dynamics, accretion disk structure ...",
Cross submissions,Testing Planck 2020 and DESI data on wCDM Models,Kathleen Sammut,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H_0} and {\sigma_8} by using the latest observational data. This research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and BAO data by comparing them to their predecessors. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers (CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe. This study also showed that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones, while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model over the dynamical dark energy models",
Cross submissions,The Shape of Dark Energy: Constraining Its Evolution with a General Parametrization,"Dong Ha Lee,Weiqiang Yang,Eleonora Di Valentino,Supriya Pan,Carsten van de Bruck",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider a general dark energy (DE) model parametrized by its equation-of-state (EoS), featuring three free parameters: $w_0$ (the present-day value of the DE EoS), $w_{\beta}$ (quantifying the dynamical nature of the DE EoS), and $\beta$ (governing various dynamical forms of the DE EoS). The key controlling parameter $\beta$ can recover several existing DE models in the literature, such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization ($\beta = 1$), the logarithmic parametrization (in the limit $\beta \rightarrow 0$), and the linear parametrization ($\beta = -1$), alongside generate a class of new DE parametrizations for other values of $\beta$. The resulting DE scenario is constrained using a suite of the latest cosmological probes, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies from three different experiments (Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope combined with WMAP), CMB lensing, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI Year 2, and PantheonPlus from Type Ia supernovae. Our analyses reveal that stringent constraints on the DE parameters are obtained only when all cosmological probes are combined; otherwise, some parameters remain unconstrained. The present-day value of the DE EoS remains in the quintessence regime according to our results, and no significant evidence for a dynamical DE EoS is found. However, based on the $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence analyses, we observe a mild preference for the present three-parameter DE parametrization over the CPL parametrization when all cosmological probes are taken into account. Nonetheless, the Bayesian evidence difference remains below the threshold for statistical significance according to the revised Jeffreys scale, indicating that both models are effectively equally preferred by the data.",
