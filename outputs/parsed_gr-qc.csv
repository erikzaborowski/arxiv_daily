New submissions,Singularity Avoidance in Gravitational Collapse of an Inhomogeneous Fluid in Rastall Gravity,"Akbar Jahan,Halime Miraghaei,Shayesteh Ghaffari,Amir Hadi Ziaie",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Various types of inhomogeneous collapse models in general relativity (GR) lead to the formation of spacetime singularities either visible or hidden by a spacetime horizon. Our aim in the present work is to search for nonsingular models in Rastall gravity that arise as the final outcomes of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of an inhomogeneous matter cloud. We firstly assume linear equations of state (EoS) for radial and tangential pressure profiles, i.e., $p_r=w_r\rho$ and $p_\theta=w_\theta\rho$, then we set the Rastall parameter in such a way that the effective pressure in radial direction vanishes and examine the conditions under which the spacetime singularity can be avoided. We find exact nonsingular collapse solutions for which the collapsing cloud reaches a minimum physical radius at a finite amount of time and then rebounds to an expanding phase where the matter shells start moving away from each other. The solutions we obtain respect the weak energy condition (WEC), which is important for the physical validity of the model.",
New submissions,Renormalization group flows in area-metric gravity,"Johanna Borissova,Bianca Dittrich,Astrid Eichhorn,Marc Schiffer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We put forward the first analysis of renormalization group flows in an area-metric theory, motivated by spin-foam quantum gravity. Area-metric gravity contains the well-known length-metric degrees of freedom of standard gravity as well as additional shape-mismatching degrees of freedom. To be phenomenologically viable, the shape-mismatching degrees of freedom have to decouple under the renormalization group flow towards lower scales. We test this scenario by calculating the renormalization group flow of the masses and find that these are in general even more relevant than dictated by their canonical scaling dimension. This generically results in masses which are large compared to the Planck mass and thereby ensure the decoupling of shape-mismatching degrees of freedom. In addition, the latter come in a left-handed and right-handed sector. We find that parity symmetry does not emerge under the renormalization group flow. Finally, we extract the renormalization group flow of the Immirzi parameter from this setup and find that its beta function features zeros at vanishing as well as at infinite Immirzi parameter.",
New submissions,Extreme mass-ratio inspiral within an ultralight scalar cloud I. Scalar radiation,"Dongjun Li,Colin Weller,Patrick Bourg,Michael LaHaye,Nicolás Yunes,Huan Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we study the dynamics of an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) embedded within a scalar cloud populated around the massive black hole. This cloud may be generated through the black hole superradiant process if the wavelength of the scalar particle is comparable to the size of the massive black hole. The EMRI motion perturbs the cloud, producing scalar radiation towards infinity and into the black hole horizon. In addition, the backreaction of the scalar radiation onto the orbit modifies the motion of the EMRI and induces an observable gravitational-wave phase shift for a range of system parameters. We quantify the scalar flux and the induced phase shift, as one of the examples of exactly-solvable, environmental effects of EMRIs.",
New submissions,Effective Field Theory of Perturbations on Arbitrary Black Hole Backgrounds with Spacelike Scalar Profile,"Shinji Mukohyama,Emeric Seraille,Kazufumi Takahashi,Vicharit Yingcharoenrat",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We develop the effective field theory (EFT) of perturbations in the context of scalar-tensor theories with a spacelike scalar profile on arbitrary black hole backgrounds. Our construction of the EFT is based on the fact that in the unitary gauge, where the scalar field is chosen as one of the spatial coordinates, the background scalar field spontaneously breaks the diffeomorphism invariance along the direction of its gradient. The residual symmetry on a timelike hypersurface of constant scalar field is referred to as the $(2+1)$d diffeomorphism invariance. We then derive a set of consistency relations, imposed on the EFT parameters, by requiring that the EFT action in the unitary gauge be invariant under the $(2+1)$d diffeomorphisms. For concreteness, we apply the EFT to study the background dynamics of a class of non-static and spherically symmetric solutions, focusing in particular on a black hole solution with a time-varying mass. We emphasize that our EFT framework is broadly applicable to any black hole background as long as the scalar field remains spacelike throughout the spacetime region of interest. This formulation provides a model-independent approach for testing scalar-tensor theories as gravity beyond general relativity in the strong-gravity regime.",
New submissions,Newman-Penrose-like exact and approximate conservation laws: a covariant and conformal formulation,Berend Schneider,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Using a conformal extension of the Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalism I derive a manifestly covariant and conformal expression of Newman-Penrose (NP) constants, which are a set of conserved quantities associated to solutions to the wave equation on light cones in Minkowski space. The resulting expression generalizes to massless fields of arbitrary spin -- including the electromagnetic field, Weyl fermions, and the linearized Weyl tensor -- on conformally flat space-times. In some non-conformally flat space-times there may exist conserved charges on very special null hypersurfaces. Using the conformal GHP formalism I prove the existence of conserved Aretakis charges on extremal Killing horizons. In the absence of exact conservation laws it is still useful to extend the definition for NP constants to some asymptotically flat curved space-times, where the conservation laws become approximate conservation laws which rapidly approach exact conservation laws at null infinity. I derive explicit expressions for spherically symmetric space-times.",
New submissions,Perturbations of Einstein-Maxwell-phantom spacetime: Instabilities of charged Ellis wormholes and quasinormal modes of black holes,"Guan-Yu Wu,Si-Yu Wang,Yan-Gang Miao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Phantom scalar fields, as a viable candidate for dark energy, have been instrumental in eliminating spacetime singularities and constructing wormholes and regular black holes. We investigate the Einstein-Maxwell-phantom (EMP) framework, in which the Ellis wormholes can be charged and regular black holes can be admitted. While the previous study has shown the stability of EMP wormholes under massless scalar field perturbations, we further perform a comprehensive linear analysis of the EMP spacetime through phantom scalar field perturbations and gravito-electromagnetic field perturbations. Our analyses of effective potentials and finite difference time profiles reveal the linear instability of EMP wormholes. In the black hole scenario, the quasinormal spectra of the EMP theory, where the matrix-valued direct integration method and the Prony method are used, recover those of general relativity when the scalar charge goes to zero. By introducing the concepts of generalized specific charge and mixing angle, we quantify how the relative contributions between the phantom scalar and the electromagnetic fields produce distinct modifications in the quasinormal spectra.",
New submissions,Cosmography of Non-Interacting Ghost and Generalized Ghost Dark Energy Models in f(Q) Gravity,"M. Sharif,Madiha Ajmal",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper aims to develop non-interacting ghost dark energy and generalized ghost dark energy models within the framework of $f(Q)$ theory using the correspondence scheme. We use pressureless matter and a power-law scale factor. The cosmic implications of the resulting models are studied through the equation of state parameter and the phase planes. We also check the stability of the reconstructed models through the squared speed of sound parameter. The equation of state parameter exhibits a phantom era, the $(\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D})$-plane indicates a freezing region, while the $(r-s)$-plane corresponds to the Chaplygin gas model for both models. It is also found that only the generalized ghost dark energy model remains stable throughout cosmic evolution. We conclude that our findings align well with current observational data.",
New submissions,Experimental demonstration of the clock asynchrony model in space-borne gravitational wave detection,"Ming-Yang Xua,Yu-Jie Tan,Ning Ma,Ao-Ting Fang,Yi-Jun Xia,Cheng-Gang Shao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"Space-borne gravitational wave detection will open the observation window in the 0.1 mHz$-$1 Hz bandwidth, playing a crucial role in the development of cosmology and physics. Precise clock synchronization among satellites is essential for the accurate detection of gravitational wave signals. However, the independent clock counting mechanisms of each satellite pose a significant challenge. This work reports the mathematical model of clock asynchrony, which is mainly dominated by the constant term factor and the linear term factor. Moreover, it experimentally verifies the clock asynchronization technique based on a dual-phasemeter system. Through experimentation, the impacts of these two aspects of clock asynchrony were confirmed, and post-processing techniques were employed to reduce these impacts to as low as $\rm 2\pi \times 10^{-6} rad/Hz^{1/2}@ 3mHz$. Specifically, the constant term factor is measured by Time-delay Interferometry Ranging (TDIR), while the linear term factor can be gauged by clock transmission link. This study provides a reference for understanding the clock asynchrony mechanism and processing clock synchronization issues. Additionally, a low additional noise clock synchronization test system is introduced to support such measurements.",
New submissions,A search for extra polarisations using a Gaussian process in Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue 3,"Shun Yin Cheung,Lachlan Passenger,Paul D. Lasky,Eric Thrane",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"General relativity predicts that gravitational waves are described by two polarisation states: the plus $+$ state and cross $\times$ state. However, alternate theories of gravity allow up to six polarisations. We employ the gravitational-wave null stream, a linear combination of three or more detectors where the $+$ and $\times$ signals add to zero, leaving behind noise and potentially gravitational waves in non-standard polarisation states. We develop a Gaussian process model to search for extra polarisations beyond general relativity. Using data from 42 three-detector events from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue, we find no evidence of non-standard polarisations. We set upper limits on the fractional deviation in gravitational-wave strain to be as low as 0.39 at 90% credibility for the event GW190602_175927.",
New submissions,Coupling Electromagnetism to Torsion: Black Holes and Spin-Charge Interactions,"Sebastian Bahamonde,Jorge Maggiolo,Christian Pfeifer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The coupling between matter fields and gravity (encoded in the geometry of spacetime) can be realized in various ways. Most commonly, a minimal coupling principle is employed, meaning that all matter fields, except spinors, couple only to the spacetime metric, while spinors additionally couple to the spacetime connection. Non-minimal couplings between matter fields and spacetime curvature can arise, for example, from quantum field theory on curved spacetime through renormalization corrections, in gauge theories of gravity, and in effective field theories. In this article, we consider a non-minimal coupling $F^{\mu\nu}\tilde{R}{\mu\nu}$ between the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field $F{\mu\nu}$ and the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor $\tilde{R}_{[\mu\nu]}$ in Riemann-Cartan geometry, which is based on a general metric-compatible connection with torsion. We find an exact 4-dimensional vacuum solution that generalizes the Reissner-Nordström black hole from Einstein-Maxwell and reveals new interactions between the intrinsic torsion-spin charge and the electric charge. Qualitatively, this solution exhibits two distinct features: the effective charge is not constrained to be positive, and the sign of the electric charge influences its gravitational effects. We also derive slowly rotating solutions in 3 dimensions, representing a generalized slowly rotating BTZ black hole solution with couplings among the magnetic and electric charges, the angular momentum, and the intrinsic torsion-spin charge.",
New submissions,Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. III. Covariant canonical quantum gravity models,"Marco Calzà,Davide Pedrotti,Guan-Wen Yuan,Sunny Vagnozzi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.",
New submissions,Estimation of gravitational production uncertainties,"Jose A. R. Cembranos,Luis J. Garay,Álvaro Parra-López,Javier Ortega del Río",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Cosmological production of scalar, non-minimally coupled dark matter depends on the specifics of the inflationary model under consideration. We analyze both Starobinsky inflation and a quadratic potential, solve the full background dynamics, study pair production during inflation and reheating, and find that the observed dark matter abundance can be explained solely by this mechanism, regardless of the inflationary model. Qualitative differences between the two cases only appear for dark matter masses close to the inflationary scale. In addition, we identify a large region in parameter space in which cosmological production of dark matter is mostly independent of the chosen inflationary potential, highlighting the robustness of this dark matter production mechanism and its independence of the unknown particular details of inflation. In the region of masses lower than the scale of inflation, and sufficiently away from the conformal limit, the total comoving number density of produced particles becomes a function of the coupling to the geometry alone. This allows us to provide an approximated analytic expression for fitting the resulting abundance.",
New submissions,4D Palatini-Cartan Gravity in Hamiltonian Form,"Giovanni Canepa,Alberto S. Cattaneo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In this note the Hamiltonian formulation of four-dimensional gravity, in the Palatini-Cartan formalism, is recovered by elimination of an auxiliary field appearing as part of the connection.",
New submissions,Primordial black hole formation in k-inflation models,"Neven Bilić,Dragoljub D. Dimitrijević,Goran S. Djordjević,Milan Milošević,Marko Stojanović",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The local primordial density fluctuations caused by quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation grow into stars and galaxies in the late universe and, if they are large enough, also produce primordial black holes. We study the formation of the primordial black holes in $k$-essence inflation models with a potential characterized by an inflection point. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models. Using the critical collapse and peaks formalism, we calculate the abundance of primordial black holes today.",
New submissions,Exploring black hole shadows in axisymmetric spacetimes with coordinate-independent methods and neural networks,"Temurbek Mirzaev,Bobomurat Ahmedov,Cosimo Bambi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The study of black hole shadows provides a powerful tool for testing the predictions of general relativity and exploring deviations from the standard Kerr metric in the strong gravitational field regime. Here, we investigate the shadow properties of axisymmetric gravitational compact objects using a coordinate-independent formalism. We analyze black hole shadows in various spacetime geometries, including the Kerr, Taub-NUT, $\gamma$, and Kaluza-Klein metrics, to identify distinctive features that can be used to constrain black hole parameters. To achieve a more robust characterization, we employ both Legendre and Fourier expansions, demonstrating that the Fourier approach may offer better coordinate independence and facilitate cross-model comparisons. Finally, we develop a machine learning framework based on neural networks trained on synthetic shadow data, enabling precise parameter estimation from observational results. Using data from observational astronomical facilities such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), Keck, and the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), we provide constraints on black hole parameters derived from shadow observations. Our findings highlight the potential of coordinate-independent techniques and machine learning for advancing black hole astrophysics and testing fundamental physics beyond general relativity.",
New submissions,Dipolar dark matter theory based on a non-Abelian Yang-Mills field,"Luc Blanchet,Emeric Seraille",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Most theories that attempt to reproduce the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) phenomenology for dark matter at galactic scales rely on ad hoc free functions, preventing them from being regarded as fundamental. In this work, we present a new theory that reproduces MOND, built on a supposed to be fundamental Yang-Mills gauge field based on SU(2), with a gravitational coupling constant, and emerging in a low-acceleration regime, below the MOND acceleration scale. The gauge field plays the role of the internal force in the dipolar dark matter (DDM) model. We discuss how certain solutions of this theory recover the deep MOND regime without introducing arbitrary functions in the action. Within this framework, the MOND phenomenology appears to be due to the existence of a new sector of particle physics.",
New submissions,PhenomXPNR: An improved gravitational wave model linking precessing inspirals and NR-calibrated merger-ringdown,"Eleanor Hamilton,Marta Colleoni,Jonathan E. Thompson,Charlie Hoy,Anna Heffernan,Meryl Kinnear,Jorge Valencia,Felip A Ramis Vidal,Cecilio García-Quirós,Shrobana Ghosh,Lionel London,Mark Hannam,Sascha Husa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present the frequency-domain quasi-circular precessing binary-black-hole model PhenomXPNR. This model combines the most precise available post-Newtonian description of the evolution of the precession dynamics through inspiral with merger-ringdown model informed by numerical relativity. This, along with a phenomenological model of the dominant multipole asymmetries, results in the most accurate and complete representation of the physics of precessing binaries natively in the frequency-domain to date. All state-of-the-art precessing models show bias when inferring binary parameters in certain regions of the parameter space. We demonstrate that the developments presented ensure that for some precessing systems PhenomXPNR shows the least degree of bias. Further, as a phenomenological, frequency-domain model, PhenomXPNR remains one of the most computationally efficient models available and is therefore well-suited to the era of gravitational-wave astronomy with its ever growing rate of detected signals.",
New submissions,Entropy Analysis of Dark Matter Halo Structures,Abdelhakim Benkrane,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we aim to derive the entropy associated with a dark matter halo modeled using a double (broken) power-law density profile. Our approach is inspired by the pioneering work of Verlinde, who proposed that gravity may not be a fundamental force but rather an emergent phenomenon rooted in entropic principles. To investigate this idea, we examine four different dark matter halo profiles: the Dehnen-type, Hernquist, Jaffe, Plummer sphere, and the perfect sphere. Using these profiles, we derive corresponding entropy expressions and assess their consistency with the second law of thermodynamics, which governs the behavior of entropy in closed systems. Furthermore, to broaden the scope of our analysis, we extend the study to a cosmological context, allowing us to explore how the derived entropy expressions influence the dynamics of the Friedmann equations that describe the evolution of the universe.",
New submissions,A Note on Chaos in Hayward Black Holes with String Fluids,"Aditya Singh,Ashes Modak,Binata Panda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we examine the onset of thermodynamic chaos in Hayward AdS black holes with string fluids, emphasizing the effects of temporal and spatially periodic perturbations. We apply Melnikov's approach to examine the perturbed Hamiltonian dynamics and detect the onset of chaotic behavior within the spinodal regime of the $(P-v)$ plot. In the case of temporal perturbations induced by thermal quenches, chaos occurs for perturbation amplitude $\gamma$ exceeding a critical threshold that can be determined by charge $q$ and the string fluid parameter. From the equation of state of the black hole, a general condition can be established indicating that under temporal perturbations, the existence of charge is an essential prerequisite for chaos. In this regime, neutral Hayward black holes do not exhibit chaotic dynamics. However, regardless of the presence of charge, spatial perturbations result in chaotic behavior. The nonlinear interplay between the regularized core geometry and string fluids drives the formation of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits in phase space, validating the persistence of chaos. The results obtained in this work, highlights the role of nonlinear matter fields and curvature regularization mechanisms in governing thermodynamic instability and the onset of chaos in Hayward black holes in AdS.",
New submissions,Dynamical-System analysis of single-axion monodromy inflation with periodically-modulated potentials,"Panagiotis Dorlis,Nick E. Mavromatos,Sotirios-Neilos Vlachos,Makarios Vyros",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we study field theoretic systems of a single axion-like field with linear potentials modulated by cosine terms, allegedly induced by non-perturbative instanton configurations. These systems are considered in expanding-Universe spacetime backgrounds (of Friedman-Lema$\hat{\rm i}$tre-Robertson-Walker type). Using a dynamical-system approach, we classify the various de-Sitter like (inflationary) vacua from the point of view of their stability, which depend on the values of the model parameters. In this respect, bifurcation points are found to be present for the various models under consideration. Part of the parameter space of the systems under consideration includes the running-vacuum (approximately) linear-axion monodromy potentials, considered in previous works by some of the authors, where inflation is induced by primordial gravitational-wave condensates. A particularly interesting case, corresponding to another part of the parameter space of the models, includes a series of stable de-Sitter vacua, which physically may correspond to a series of successive tunnelings of the system, via say non-perturbative effects, with a decreasing effective cosmological constant. Under certain values of the parameters, these successive tunnelings can reach a Minkowski spacetime, with zero value of the minimum of the axion potential. The situation is not dissimilar to the one of discrete inflation that arguably characterizes some minimal non-critical-string (Liouville) models of cosmology. Finally, for comparison, we also include in this article a dynamical-system study of standard axion-monodromy-modulated potentials characterizing some string/brane-compactification models of inflation.",
New submissions,Neutron stars in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories: Axial perturbations,"Hamza Boumaza,David Langlois",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the axial (or odd-parity) perturbations of neutron stars in a one-parameter subclass of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. After recalling the equilibrium neutron star configurations obtained in a previous work by solving the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in DHOST theories, we derive the action at quadratic order in linear perturbations of axial type. We then compute the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) for several values of the modified gravity parameter and various equations of state, observing deviations of both frequencies and damping times with respect to general relativity. We also analyze the impact of our modified gravity parameter on the universal relations relating the (rescaled) frequencies and damping times to the compactness of the neutron star.",
Cross submissions,"From Fluctuation to Polarization: Imprints of $O(1-10)\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ Curvature Perturbations in CMB B-modes from Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves","Aurora Ireland,Kuver Sinha,Tao Xu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Probing primordial curvature perturbations on small scales, beyond those accessible using cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropies and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, remains a major open challenge. Current constraints on the scalar power spectrum at these scales are either weak or rely heavily on model-dependent assumptions about small-scale structure. In this work, we propose a novel method to probe the small-scale primordial power spectrum using scalar-induced tensor perturbations, which are inevitably sourced by curvature perturbations at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. While induced tensor modes have traditionally been studied in the context of the stochastic gravitational wave background, we highlight a complementary observable: the distinctive pattern of B-mode polarization they imprint on the CMB. We compute the angular spectrum of these B-modes arising from enhanced scalar perturbations and show that the resulting signal can be competitive with inflationary predictions for values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio targeted in upcoming CMB experiments, most notably CMB-Stage 4. We map the region of the scalar power spectrum to which these future B-mode experiments will be sensitive and compare with existing constraints, finding it to exceed current sensitivities at $k \sim O(1-10)\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In addition to providing a new CMB-based probe of the small-scale power spectrum, this work also motivates dedicated B-mode searches at higher multipoles ($\ell \gtrsim 100$).",
Cross submissions,Do Pulsar Timing Datasets Favor Massive Gravity?,"Chris Choi,Tina Kahniashvili",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Several observational phenomena suggest that the standard model of cosmology and particle physics requires revision. To address this, we consider the extension of general relativity known as massive gravity (MG). In this Letter, we explore the imprints of MG on the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs): their modified dispersion relation and their additional (two vector and one scalar) polarization modes on the stochastic GW background (SGWB) detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We analyze the effects of massive GWs on the Hellings-Downs curve induced by modification of the overlap reduction function. Our study consists of analyzing observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the Chinese PTA Data Release I, and is independent of the origin of the SGWB (astrophysical or cosmological). By considering the bound on the graviton mass imposed through the dispersion relation, we scrutinize the possibility of detecting traces of MG in the PTA observational data. We find that massive GWs predict better fits for the observed pulsar correlations. Future PTA missions with more precise data will hopefully be able to detect the GW additional polarization modes and might be effectively used to constrain the graviton mass.",
Cross submissions,Stochastic inflation as an open quantum system,Yue-Zhou Li,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We reinterpret Starobinsky's stochastic inflation as an open quantum system, where short-wavelength modes act as the environment for long-wavelength modes. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we systematically trace out the environment and derive an effective theory for the reduced density matrix, including deviations from exact de Sitter. The resulting master equation is a Lindblad equation, which reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation for the diagonal elements up to higher orders in the slow-roll expansion, while also yielding a more complete equation in phase space. Finally, we extend the formalism to global de Sitter, for which the associated Fokker-Planck equation lacks equilibrium solutions until the late-time regime $aH \gg 1$.",
Cross submissions,Resolving Turbulent Magnetohydrodynamics: A Hybrid Operator-Diffusion Framework,"Semih Kacmaz,E. A. Huerta,Roland Haas",Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph),"We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically meaningful predictions.",
Cross submissions,Milliarcsecond astrometric oscillations in AGN as a precursor of multi-messaging gravitational wave events,"Leonid I. Gurvits,Alexander G. Polnarev,Sandor Frey,Oleg Titov,Angelina A. Osetrova,Xiaohui Fan,Alexey Melnikov",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The existence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is predicted by various cosmological and evolutionary scenarios for active galactic nuclei. These objects are considered as contributors into the gravitational wave (GW) background and emitters of discrete GW bursts. Yet, SMBHBs remain a rather elusive class of extragalactic objects. Previously we have identified the quasar J2102+6015 as potential SMBHB system based on its oscillating astrometric pattern. We analysed the available VLBI astrometry data and identified another case of astrometric oscillations in the source J0204+1514. We assume these oscillations as manifestations of orbital motion in a binary systems. We estimated parameters of the suspected SMBHB in this source and applied basic theoretical models for projecting its evolution toward coalescence. We also develop a toy model of SMBHB consistent with the discovered astrometric oscillations and give quantitative predictions of GW emission of such the source using the case of J0204+1514 as an example. As an ad hoc result, we also provide a re-assessed estimate of the redshift of J2102+6015, z=1.42. A toy model of the object containing SMBHB with parameters consistent with the observed astrometric oscillations of the source J0204+1514 enabled us to consider GW emission as the cause of the system's orbital evolution. Astrometric VLBI monitoring has an appreciable potential for future detections of SMBHBs as multi-messenger targets for both electromagnetic (in radio domain) and gravitational wave astronomy. To outline the contours of a future physical model connecting SMBHB with detectable GW manifestations, we apply the toy model to the source J0204+1514. We also provide justification for aiming future space-borne VLBI missions toward direct imaging of SMBHBs as a synergistic contribution into future multi-messenger studies involving prospective GW facilities.",
Cross submissions,A Kalman-smoother based data imputation strategy to data gaps in spaceborne gravitational wave detectors,"Tingyang Shen,He Wang,Jibo He",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) and other sources within the frequency band of spaceborne gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji and Tianqin pose unique challenges, as gaps and glitches during the years-long observation lead to both loss of information and spectral leakage. We propose a novel data imputation strategy based on Kalman filter and smoother to mitigate gap-induced biases in parameter estimation. Applied to a scenario where traditional windowing and smoothing technique introduce significant biases, our method mitigates the biases and demonstrates lower computational cost compared to existing data augmentation techniques such as noise inpainting. This framework presents a new gap treatment approach that balances robustness and efficiency for space-based gravitational wave data analysis.",
Cross submissions,Measuring black hole spins with X-ray reflection spectroscopy: A GRMHD outlook,"Swarnim Shashank,Askar B. Abdikamalov,Honghui Liu,Abdurakhmon Nosirov,Cosimo Bambi,Indu K. Dihingia,Yosuke Mizuno",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"X-ray reflection spectroscopy has evolved as one of the leading methods to measure black hole spins. However, the question is whether its measurements are subjected to systematic biases, especially considering the possible discrepancy between the spin measurements inferred with this technique and those from gravitational wave observations. In this work, we use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of thin accretion disks around spinning black holes for modeling the accretion process, and then we simulate NuSTAR observations to test the capability of modern reflection models in recovering the input spins. For the first time, we model the electron density and ionization profiles from GRMHD-simulated disks. Our study reveals that current reflection models work well only for fast-rotating black holes. We model the corona as the base of the jet and we find that reflection models with lamppost emissivity profiles fail to recover the correct black hole spins. Reflection models with broken power-law emissivity profiles perform better. As we increase the complexity of the simulated models, it is more difficult to recover the correct input spins, pointing towards the need to update our current reflection models with more advanced accretion disks and coronal geometries.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Waves from Gauge Quanta Produced during Inflation,"Kai-Ge Zhang,Jian-Feng He,Chengjie Fu,Zong-Kuan Guo",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to a gauge field via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta, which can act as a source of gravitational waves (GWs) with potentially observable amplitudes. In this work, we investigate GW production in a spectator axion model when strong backreaction is taken into account. We find that decreasing the decay constant of the axion enhances GW production. Since the initial value of the axion is larger than its quantum fluctuations, such a condition imposes a lower bound on the axion dacay constant, which sets an upper bound on the amplitude of the energy spectrum of GWs. As a result, the amplitude of the predicted GW energy spectrum is lower than $10^{-10}$ in the nHz to mHz frequency range.",
Cross submissions,Classification of $f(R)$ Theories Of Inflation And The Uniqueness of Starobinsky Model,Marco Piva,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We classify $f(R)$ theories using a mathematical analogy between slow-roll inflation and the renormalization-group flow. We derive the power spectra and spectral indices class by class and compare them with the latest data. The framework used for the classification allows us to determine the general structure of the $f(R)$ functions that belong to each class. Our main result is that only two classes survive. Moreover, we show that the Starobinsky model is the only polynomial $f(R)$ that can realize slow-roll inflation. In fact, all other polynomials belong to a special class that can only realize constant-roll inflation, at least far enough in the past. We point out some of the issues involved in considering a smooth transition between constant-roll and slow-roll inflation in this class of models. Finally, we derive the map that transforms the results from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame.",
Cross submissions,Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn,"Meng-Lin Zhao,Yue Shao,Sai Wang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.",
Cross submissions,Axion USR Inflation,"Alireza Talebian,Hassan Firouzjahi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider a model of inflation in which the inflaton field is a rolling axion with a potential which is flat enough to support an intermediate phase of USR inflation. Because of the Chern-Simons interaction, one polarization of the gauge field experiences the tachyonic growth during the first slow-roll stage, inducing large corrections in curvature perturbations via the inverse decay effect. A non-trivial feature of our setup is that once the system enters the USR phase, the instability parameter falls off rapidly, terminating the gauge field production efficiently. Consequently, the power spectrum involves two separate peaks, the first peak is induced by the gauge field particles production while the second peak is due to standard USR mechanism. We show that the power spectrum at the intermediate scales develops strong scale-dependence $\propto k^m$ with the index $m >4$. Calculating the bispectrum, we demonstrate that non-Gaussianities with non-trivial shapes and multiple peaks are generated in this setup.",
Cross submissions,Bayesian frequency estimation at the fundamental quantum limit,"James W. Gardner,Tuvia Gefen,Ethan Payne,Su Direkci,Sander M. Vermeulen,Simon A. Haine,Joseph J. Hope,Lee McCuller,Yanbei Chen",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Searching for a weak signal at an unknown frequency is a canonical task in experiments probing fundamental physics such as gravitational-wave observatories and ultra-light dark matter haloscopes. These state-of-the-art sensors are limited by quantum noise arising from the fundamental uncertainty about the state of the device. Classically, frequency estimation suffers from a threshold effect in the signal-to-noise ratio such that weak signals are extremely hard to localise in frequency. We show that this phenomenon persists at the fundamental quantum limit but that the classical approach, a quadrature measurement, can nevertheless be beaten by a coherent protocol of projecting onto the ""quantum whitened"" possible quantum states. Quantum whitening is a covariant measurement, and we examine it analytically in the wide-prior limit and numerically for finite-width priors. Beyond accelerating searches for unknown frequencies, quantum whitening may be used generally to sense the parameter of a unitary encoding given no prior information about the parameter.",
