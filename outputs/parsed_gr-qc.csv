New submissions,Observing an accretion disk inside a wormhole shadow,"I. D. Novikov,S. V. Repin,D. A. Paksivatova",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),The paper considers the problem of the possibility of observing an accretion disk through the throat of the Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormhole. It is shown that this image has a complex structure and is fundamentally different from the image of an accretion disk around a black hole. Images of the accretion disk are presented at various angles between the plane of the disk and the observer's line of sight.,
New submissions,Creating a Universe from Nothing as an Alternative to the Cosmological Principle,"Philip D. Mannheim,Daniel A. Norman,Tianye Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the cosmological Robertson-Walker geometry required of the cosmological principle both the Weyl tensor $C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ and the Bach tensor $W^{\mu\nu}=[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}-R_{\lambda\kappa}]C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ vanish. In general, in perturbations around the cosmological background neither of the fluctuating $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ or $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ would vanish. However, it is possible for $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ to vanish even as $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ does not. In this paper we construct an explicit model in which this is the case. The model consists of a tensor gravitational wavefluctuating around a background with a constant negative 3-curvature. The model is exactly solvable and consists purely of geometric quantities with no matter fields at all (i.e., $G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta W^{\mu\nu}=0$, where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor). The model can thus be created out of nothing, with creating a universe from nothing thus being an alternative principle to the cosmological principle. The fluctuating gravitational wave contributes to the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background in a calculable manner, for which we provide a simple analytic way of treating spatial modes that is based on the use of a spatial mode addition theorem. In addition, we provide a treatment of the anisotropy that is based on properties of bandwidth limited functions.",
New submissions,Lyapunov Exponent Approach to Phase Structure of Schwarzschild AdS Black Holes Surrounded by a Cloud of Strings,"Arun Kumar,Qiang Wu,Tao Zhu,Sushant G. Ghosh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate Schwarzschild black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes surrounded by a cloud of strings (BH-AdS-CoS), incorporating both electric- and magnetic-like components of the string bi-vector. Thermodynamically, these systems exhibit small/intermediate/large black hole phases with first- and second-order transitions governed by the string parameter $c_0$. Dynamically, we probe the phase structure using Lyapunov exponents $\lambda$ from unstable circular geodesics. For massless particles ($\delta = 0$), analytical expressions $\lambda$ reveal multivalued behavior in first-order transition regimes ($c_0 < c_{\text{cri}}$), with branches mapping to thermodynamic phases ($\lambda_{\text{SBH}}, \lambda_{\text{IBH}}, \lambda_{\text{LBH}}$). The discontinuity $\Delta\lambda = \lambda_{\text{SBH}} - \lambda_{\text{LBH}}$ at $T_p$ follows mean-field scaling: $\Delta\lambda / \lambda_{\text{cri}} \propto (T_\text{cri} - T)^{1/2} \quad (\beta = 1/2)$. For massive particles ($\delta = 1$), numerical computation of timelike geodesics confirms $\lambda$ as an order parameter, with critical exponent $\beta = 1/2$ universally. Key distinctions emerge: $\lambda\to 1$ asymptotically for photons, while $\lambda\to 0$ in the significant black hole phase for massive particles due to vanishing unstable orbits. The transition of $\lambda$ from multivalued to single-valued at $c_0 = c_{\text{cri}}$ establishes it as a universal dynamical probe of black hole criticality. The universal critical exponent of 1/2 for \(\Delta\lambda\) further reinforces the analogy with conventional thermodynamic systems. Our results confirm a direct connection between the thermodynamic phase structure of BH-AdS-CoS and the dynamics of test particles, with the Lyapunov exponent emerging as a sensitive diagnostic of black hole criticality.",
New submissions,Traversable Kaluza-Klein wormholes?,"Christopher Simmonds(Victoria University of Wellington),Matt Visser(Victoria University of Wellington)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Various authors have suggested that Kaluza--Klein variants of traversable wormholes might to some extent ameliorate the defocussing properties (the curvature condition violations, and implied energy condition violations) inherent in positing the existence of a traversable wormhole throat. We shall show that in a Kaluza--Klein context the price paid for completely eliminating the defocussing properties of the wormhole throat is extremely high -- the 5th dimension has to become truly enormous (formally infinite) in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, in a manner that is fundamentally incompatible with the traditional Kaluza--Klein ansatz. While traversable Kaluza--Klein wormholes might be interesting for other reasons, it must be emphasized that adding a 5th dimension is not particularly useful in terms of ameliorating violations of the curvature conditions.",
New submissions,Optical Characteristics of the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole,"Xiao-Xiong Zeng,Chen-Yu Yang,Hao Yu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black hole, a theoretical model of a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field, has been proposed recently by Podolsky and Ovcharenko. This study investigates the optical characteristics of the Kerr-BR black hole based on the exact solution. We analyze the optical image under two illumination models: a celestial light source and a geometrically thin accretion disk. We reveal distinct roles for the fundamental parameters in the model. Specifically, it is found that under both illumination models, the effect of the rotation parameter on the optical image of the Kerr-BR black hole is significantly different from that of the magnetic field. As the magnetic field increases, the radii of both the shadow and the Einstein ring enlarge. We also attempt to use the data from M87* and Sgr A* to constrain the magnetic field. These results enhance our understanding of the optical characteristics of the Kerr-BR black hole and establish a theoretical foundation for interpreting future observations on the optical image of the black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field. Finally, we point out that with advances in the resolution of black hole images, it is possible to detect potential BR-like magnetic fields around black holes.",
New submissions,On the viability of minimal Hořava gravity,"Ted Jacobson,Pranav Pulakkat",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Hořava gravity is a Lorentz-violating modification of general relativity (GR) with a preferred spacelike foliation. Observational evidence has put strong constraints on the parameter values in this model, so that the remaining viable sector is well-characterized by the Newton constant and a single additional parameter. We analyze this restricted theory, which is called minimal Hořava gravity ($\mathrm{mHg}$), from the Hamiltonian point of view. We find that in order to eliminate a pathological mode that is unstable at high frequencies and strongly coupled at low frequencies the theory must be further restricted so that the slices of the preferred foliation each have constant mean curvature. We dub this theory ""minimal minimal Hořava gravity"" ($\mathrm{m^2Hg}$). It has two regimes; one in which the mean curvature is time independent, in which case it is equivalent to a particular foliation of GR with nonzero cosmological constant, and another in which the mean curvature is time dependent. In the latter there is an infinite propagation speed since the lapse evolves via an elliptic equation, and the theory thus differs from GR in a peculiar nonlocal fashion. To probe the viability of the sector with time dependent mean curvature, we study in detail the problem of spherical collapse of a thin dust shell. The solution is determined unambiguously from initial conditions until the slice on which the shell first contracts to a point. Afterwards, there is an instantaneously propagating spherical mode with undetermined evolution, demonstrating a failure of the Cauchy problem.",
New submissions,Probing the Weak Gravity Conjecture: Novel Aschenbach Signatures in Superextremal Non-Linear Charged AdS Black Holes,"Mohammad Reza Alipour,Mohammad Ali S Afshar,Saeed Noori Gashti,Behnam Pourhassan,Jafar Sadeghi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This study investigates the nonlinear charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole solution within the framework of massive gravity, motivated by recent advancements linking the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) to phenomena such as Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) and photon sphere dynamics. Building on these foundations, we focus on the Aschenbach effect-a relativistic phenomenon intricately tied to the geometry of photon spheres and known to occur in some special sub-extremal non rotating black holes. Our primary objective is to determine whether this effect persists not only up to the extremal limit but also beyond, into the superextremal regime, thus probing the stability and validity of black hole characteristics in these extreme conditions. By analyzing the nonlinear charged AdS black hole solutions in massive gravity, we demonstrate that the Aschenbach effect remains a robust feature across both extremal and superextremal configurations. This extension suggests that key relativistic signatures and the underlying spacetime structures associated with high-spin black holes continue to hold beyond classical boundaries. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of ultra-compact objects and highlight promising directions for exploring the limits of general relativity, as well as potential generalizations of the WGC and WCC in strong gravitational fields.",
New submissions,"Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder Black Hole with Quintessential Dark Energy and a String Clouds: Geodesics, Perturbative Dynamics, and Thermal Properties","Faizuddin Ahmed,Ahmad Al-Badawi,İzzet Sakallı",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we explore a deformed Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within a loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework incorporating both a quintessence field (QF) and a cloud of strings (CS), aiming to understand how these exotic fields collectively influence various physical phenomena in the BH's vicinity. We systematically investigate the quantum Oppenheimer--Snyder (QOS) spacetime by deriving the complete metric and analyzing horizon structures, showing significant modifications to the classical geometry through the interplay of quantum deformation effects, CS, and QF parameters. Our comprehensive geodesic analysis demonstrates that null geodesics exhibit modified effective potentials and altered photon trajectories, while timelike geodesics show enhanced orbital velocities and geodesic precession frequencies compared to classical predictions, providing potentially observable signatures through precision measurements. The BH shadow investigation reveals systematic increases in shadow radius with both CS and QF parameters, offering new possibilities for testing exotic matter configurations through next-generation high-resolution observations. We examine field perturbations of different spins -- including scalar, electromagnetic (EM), and fermionic fields -- demonstrating that the BH remains stable under external disturbances while exhibiting modified quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra that could serve as observational discriminators. Most remarkably, our thermodynamic analysis reveals exotic thermal behavior including negative temperature regimes, fundamentally altered stability conditions, and genuine phase transitions between distinct BH configurations, extending well beyond classical general relativity predictions.",
New submissions,Particle Dynamics and Thermal Properties in Kalb-Ramond ModMax Black Holes: Theoretical Predictions for Observational Tests of Exotic Physics,"Faizuddin Ahmed,Ahmad Al-Badawi,İzzet Sakallı",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a comprehensive theoretical study of geodesic motion and thermodynamic behavior in Kalb--Ramond (KR) black hole (BH) spacetimes sourced by ModMax electrodynamics. Both neutral and charged test particle dynamics are investigated, highlighting how the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter $\ell$, the ModMax nonlinearity parameter $\gamma$, and the discrete branch parameter $\zeta$ significantly modify orbital structures compared to classical Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordström (RN) solutions. Effective potential analysis reveals notable shifts in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO): ordinary branches allow stable orbits closer to the horizon, while phantom branches shift them outward by factors of 5--10. For charged particles, the combined influence of modified gravity and nonlinear electromagnetic fields may induce chaotic trajectories in certain regimes. On the thermodynamic side, we derive full expressions for Hawking temperature, entropy, and Helmholtz free energy. Ordinary branches exhibit divergent specific heat indicating second-order phase transitions, whereas phantom branches yield consistently negative specific heat, implying thermal instability. Phantom BHs are found to possess higher Hawking temperatures and show distinct thermodynamic phase structures, including Hawking--Page-type transitions. Observational features such as BH shadows and gravitational lensing are explored, revealing parameter-dependent changes in photon sphere radii and deflection angles. Notably, the deflection angle analysis via the Gauss--Bonnet theorem method (GBTm) shows opposite-sign electromagnetic corrections for phantom versus ordinary branches, suggesting potential observational discriminants.",
New submissions,Volume-distance-ratio asymptote and spacetime inextensibility of spatially flat FLRW spacetime,Pengyu Le,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"We study the volume-distance-ratio (VDR) asymptote at a past timelike boundary point of spatially flat FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t) = t^{\alpha}$, for $\alpha \geq 1$ or $\alpha \in (0,1)$. We employ the spacetime inextensibility criteria via the volume-distance-ratio asymptote to deduce its inextensibility. We show that for spatial dimensions greater than $2$, there exists at least one nonzero critical exponent $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for which the VDR asymptote along a $\Sigma_t$-orthogonal geodesic is equal to the Minkowski value.",
New submissions,The shadow and quasinormal modes of the asymptotically flat hairy black holes with a dilaton potential,"Sheng-Han Xiong,Yong-Zhuang Li,Xiao-Mei Kuang,Jerzy Matyjasek",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this article, the shadow and the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of an exact asymptotically flat hairy electrically charged black hole solution with a dilaton potential are investigated. Using the {constraint} equation among the integration constant $\eta$ of the gravitational field, the mass $M$, the electric charge $Q$ and the coupling constant $\nu$ between the $U(1)$ field and the dilaton field, we find that the shadow radii, the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and the coordinate angular velocity $\Omega_{c}$ only significantly affected by $\nu$ if the $Q$ is close to the extremal value, especially when $\nu$ approaches to one. Furthermore, the QNMs are numerically computed by using the Hatsuda method and verify with the higher-order WKB approximations with the Padé summation. We find that the QNMs are close to that of the low energy limit of the string theory when $\nu$ is large enough. In the eikonal limit, the real and imaginary parts are proved to be given by $\Omega_{c}$ and $\lambda$, respectively.",
New submissions,Squeezed Quasinormal Modes from Nonlinear Gravitational Effects,"Sreenath K. Manikandan,Frank Wilczek",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),We demonstrate that long-lived black hole quasi-normal modes become quantum mechanically squeezed due to nonlinear gravitational effects. We estimate the degree of squeezing for the fundamental mode of a Schwarzschild black hole quantitatively.,
New submissions,Decadal upgrade strategy for KAGRA toward post-O5 gravitational-wave astronomy,KAGRA Collaboration,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The KAGRA Collaboration has investigated a ten-year upgrade strategy for the KAGRA gravitational wave detector, considering a total of 14 upgrade options that vary in mirror mass, quantum noise reduction techniques, and the quality of cryogenic suspensions. We evaluated the scientific potential of these configurations with a focus on key targets such as parameter estimation of compact binary coalescences, binary neutron star post-merger signals, and continuous gravitational waves. Rather than aiming to improve all science cases uniformly, we prioritized those most sensitive to the detector configuration. Technical feasibility was assessed based on required hardware developments, associated R\&D efforts, cost, and risk. Our study finds that a high-frequency upgrade plan that enhances sensitivity over a broad frequency range above ~200 Hz offers the best balance between scientific return and technical feasibility. Such an upgrade would enable sky localization of binary neutron star mergers at 100 Mpc to better than 0.5 deg$^2$ in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network, and improve the measurement precision of tidal deformability parameter by approximately 10% at median, compared to a network without KAGRA.",
New submissions,"Holographic F(Q,T) Gravity with Lambert Solution","Houda Filali,Mouhsine Koussou,Mohamed Bennai,Rachid Ahl Laamara",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we study a model of holographic dark energy using FLRW cosmology in the context of modified gravity. An extension of the symmetric teleparallel gravity is obtained by considering the gravitational action L is given by an arbitrary function f of the nonmetricity Q, where the nonmetricity Q is responsible for the gravitational interaction, and the trace of the matter energy momentum tensor T, so that L=f(Q,T). We expand on the features of the derived cosmological model in view of the relation between cosmic time and redshift as t(z)=kt0/b*f(z) where f(z) = W[b/k*e((b-ln(1+z))/k)] and W denotes the Lambert function, and discuss the evolution of the trajectories of the equation of state parameters and deceleration parameter in the evolving universe using a special then generalized version of the model.",
New submissions,"Dynamics of Linear Scalar Perturbation in f(Q)+f(T) class of f(Q,T) gravity","Houda Filali,Rachid Ahl Laamara,Mohamed Bennai,El Hassan Saidi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we study the f(Q,T) model of symmetric teleparallel modified gravity in the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. Using a general approach, we extract the differential matter density equation then we simplify it as a second-order equation by considering the sub-Hubble approximation. Our analysis is then based on two different forms of f(Q,T) that we study in a classic approach and again using Holographic dark energy. Our initial results yield a significant divergence from the perturbed behavior of the LambdaCDM model, imposing stringent constraints on the feasibility of this class of theories but the HDE contribution triggers an interesting discussion.",
New submissions,Lyapunov exponents and phase transition of charged Ads black hole in quintessence,"Xiaobo Guo,Rui Yang,Yizhi Liang,Jun Tao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study investigates the phase transitions of RN-AdS black holes immersed in a quintessence field, employing Lyapunov exponents as a dynamical probe to characterize the thermodynamics of black hole. Incorporating quintessence dark energy into the RN-AdS framework, we find that the Lyapunov exponents for null and timelike geodesics display diminished chaotic behavior with increasing normalization factor of the quintessence field. This feature introduces a finite cutoff to the Lyapunov exponent of unstable circular photon orbits, setting it apart from RN-AdS black hole. At phase transition points, both the free energy and Lyapunov exponents display multivalued branches, reflecting the coexistence of distinct black hole phases. Furthermore, the discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent can serve as an order parameter with a critical exponent of $1/2$ near the critical point, consistent with the thermodynamic criticality of van der Waals fluids.. These work suggest that Lyapunov exponents provide a framework for probing the thermodynamics of black holes.",
New submissions,"The $1/c$ expansion of general relativity in a $3+1$ formulation, revisited",Mahmut Elbistan,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the $1/c$ expansion of general relativity within a formulation that is compatible with both the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner and the Kol-Smolkin decompositions. The Einstein-Hilbert action takes a common form for those decompositions as they are dual to each other. We first develop a method to expand this generic form and then push the expansion up to $c^{-3}$ order within this novel approach. Next, we apply our technique to the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and expand it up to $c^{-3}$ order explicitly. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our method and to highlight the duality at the level of expansion, we also perform the expansion in the Kol-Smolkin decomposition up to $c^{-1}$ order. Lastly, we make some all-order observations.",
New submissions,Testing Gauss-Bonnet Gravity with DESI BAO Data,"Praveen Kumar Dhankar,Dalale Mhamdi,Albert Munyeshyaka,Darshan Kumar,Joseph Ntahompagaze,Taoufik Oualib",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the present paper, we observationally constrain f (G) gravity at the background level using Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon Plus (PP) sample, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and the recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI. For the analysis, we consider two combinations of datasets: (i) PP + CC, and (ii) PP + CC + DESI BAO. In both cases, we determine the best-fit parameters by numerically solving the modified Friedmann equations for two distinct f (G) models, namely the power-law and exponential forms. This is achieved through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. To assess the statistical significance of the f (G) models, we employ both the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our results show that both f (G) models are statistically favored over the standard {\Lambda}CDM model. Notably, the exponential model exhibits an additional future transition at redshift closer to -0.1, indicating a possible return to a decelerating phase. This distinctive behavior sets it apart from both the power-law model and the {\Lambda}CDM scenario, which predict continued acceleration into the future.",
New submissions,Interferometric signature of higher-order images in a parametrized framework,"Fabiano Feleppa,Fabio Aratore,Valerio Bozza",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"This paper investigates gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit, focusing particularly on higher-order images produced near compact objects such as black holes and their observable impact through the visibility function. Employing a robust parametrization framework proposed by Rezzolla and Zhidenko, the study systematically explores deviations from the Schwarzschild metric. A detailed theoretical analysis of interferometric observables is provided, highlighting how higher-order images imprint distinctive, measurable patterns in the visibility function, notably characterized by a staircase-like structure. By parametrically varying metric coefficients, the analysis reveals clear dependencies between spacetime deviations and key observational signatures, specifically the step heights and periodicities in the interferometric visibility. The results enhance the theoretical groundwork for interpreting data from advanced interferometric observations, potentially enabling precise tests of general relativity and the discrimination among alternative gravitational theories.",
Cross submissions,Love beyond Einstein: Metric reconstruction and Love number in quadratic gravity using WEFT,"Arpan Bhattacharyya,Saptaswa Ghosh,Naman Kumar,Shailesh Kumar,Sounak Pal",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.",
Cross submissions,New high-frequency gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions,Wen-Yuan Ai,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"First-order phase transitions in the early Universe are a well-motivated source of gravitational waves (GWs). In this Letter, we identify a previously overlooked GW production mechanism: gravitational transition radiation, arising from graviton emission by particles whose mass changes as they pass through expanding bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collisions or sound waves, this mechanism operates at the microscopic scale set by the Lorentz-contracted wall thickness, leading to GW emission at significantly higher frequencies. The resulting spectrum features a distinctive shape with a peak frequency redshifting to $f_{\rm peak}\sim \gamma_w T_0\sim \gamma_w\times 10^{10}\,{\rm Hz}$ where $\gamma_w$ is the Lorentz boost factor of the wall velocity and $T_0$ is the current temperature of the Universe. This mechanism is generic and is expected to operate similarly for domain walls and other relativistic interfaces.",
Cross submissions,Position drift with Gaia,"Andreas Tsigkas Kouvelis,Asta Heinesen,Shashank Shalgar,Mikołaj Korzyński",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The proper motion (also known as position drift) field of extragalactic sources at cosmological distances across our sky can be used to measure the acceleration of the Solar System through the aberration effect. If measured very precisely, the signal would also hold cosmological information, for instance about bulk flows of distant sources or the presence of tensor modes. In the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, the acceleration of the Solar System is by far the dominant contributor to the position drift signal for sources at cosmological distances, and the measurement is therefore expected to yield a constant spheroidal dipole across redshifts as long as convergence to the cosmic restframe has been reached. The aim of this paper is to test this hypothesis. We analyze data from the cosmic reference frame dataset of Gaia data release 3 focusing on constraining the dipole and quadrupole in the position drift signal, with an emphasis on redshift dependence of the signal as a consistency test of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The spheroidal dipole that we find is in mild tension, at the level of $2-3\sigma$, with the constant-in-redshift signature expected from the local acceleration of the Solar System. We also find significant quadrupole components, that however do not have any significant evolution with redshift. The most straightforward interpretation of these findings is (unknown) systematic errors related to the Gaia instrumentation, but a cosmological origin is a possibility. Our analysis remains inconclusive on the cause of the redshift dependence of the dipole and warrants further investigations with upcoming data releases. We discuss possible implications of our results and highlight the importance of proper motion measurements for rest frame determinations in cosmology. In our discussion, we highlight interesting avenues for doing cosmology with Gaia data.",
Cross submissions,Bounding anisotropic Lorentz Invariance Violation from measurements of the effective energy scale of quantum gravity,"Merce Guerrero,Anna Campoy-Ordaz,Robertus Potting,Markus Gaug",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Observations of energy-dependent photon time delays from distant flaring sources provide significant constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). Such effects originate from modified vacuum dispersion relations, causing differences in propagation times for photons emitted simultaneously from gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, or pulsars. These modifications are often parametrized within a general framework by an effective quantum gravity energy scale $E_{QG,n}$. While such general constraints are well established in the LIV literature, their translation into specific coefficients of alternative theoretical frameworks, such as the Standard-Model Extension (SME), is rarely carried out. In particular, existing bounds on the quadratic case ($n=2$) of $E_{QG,n}$ can be systematically converted into constraints on the non-birefringent, CPT-conserving SME coefficients $c^{(6)}_{(I)jm}$. This work provides a concise overview of the relevant SME formalism and introduces a transparent conversion method from $E_{QG,2}$ to SME parameters. We review the most stringent time-of-flight-based bounds on $E_{QG,n}$ and standardize them by accounting for systematics, applying missing prefactors, and transforming results into two-sided Gaussian uncertainties where needed. We then use these standardized constraints, along with additional bounds from the literature, to improve bounds on the individual SME coefficients of the photon sector by about an order of magnitude. A consistent methodology is developed to perform this conversion from the general LIV framework to the SME formalism.",
Cross submissions,The dyonic Kerr-Schild ansatz,"Eloy Ayón-Beato,Daniel Flores-Alfonso,Mokhtar Hassaine,Daniel F. Higuita-Borja",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a geometric extension of the Kerr-Schild ansatz that incorporates both electric and magnetic sectors of the Maxwell field in a unified framework, without resorting to duality rotations. We start observing that the known purely electric solution satisfies Maxwell's equations due to a closedness condition obeyed by the Kerr-Schild null congruence. From the associated local exactness property, we construct a new one-form naturally linked to the congruence as a sort of Poincaré dualization. This leads us to propose a geometrically motivated dyonic vector potential within the Kerr-Schild ansatz, defined as a superposition of an electric contribution along the congruence and a magnetic one that aligns to the dualized one-form. We then show that for a stationary and axisymmetric Kerr-Schild ansatz, the electrovac circularity theorem uniquely constrains not only the scalar profile of the metric, but also those associated to the electric-magnetic splitting of the gauge field. The resulting formalism provides a transparent derivation of the dyonic Kerr-Newman solution and extends naturally to the (A)dS case, highlighting the intrinsic interplay between geometry and matter in a Kerr-Schild setting.",
Cross submissions,Today's Experiments Suffice to Verify the Quantum Essence of Gravity,Martin Plávala,Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The gravity-mediated entanglement experiments employ concepts from quantum information to argue that if gravitational interaction creates entanglement between two systems, then gravity cannot be described by a classical system. However, the proposed experiments remain beyond out current technological capability, with optimistic projections placing the experiment outside of short-term future. Here we leverage quantum information techniques to argue that current matter-wave interferometers are sufficient to indirectly prove that gravitational interaction creates entanglement between two systems. Specifically, we prove that if we experimentally verify the Schrödinger equation for a single delocalized system interacting gravitationally with an external mass, then the time evolution of two delocalized systems will lead to gravity-mediated entanglement. Our findings indicate that the experimental verification of the quantum essence of gravity is on the horizon.",
Cross submissions,Visualising relativistic effects in redshift space distortions of large scale structure,"Pritha Paul,Chris Clarkson",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Observing large scale structure in redshift space gives rise to the well known redshift space distortions whereby a spherical distribution of galaxies is distorted into an ellipsoid along the line of sight of the observer. This effect is important on linear scales and so can be thought of as a Newtonian correction to the density perturbation even though their physical origin is in the Doppler effect. On larger scales subtler aspects of the Doppler and gravitational redshift effects give rise to further distortions in redshift space. These further contort objects beyond an ellipsoidal compression, into shapes with broken line-of-sight symmetry such as an egg- or bean-like shapes. In this paper, we aim to qualitatively picture how large over-dense regions, including clusters or superclusters, and under-dense regions, such as voids, undergoing infall or outflow respectively, become distorted in redshift space when higher-order relativistic effects are taken into account. This will contribute when analysing structure in real space such as stacking voids which are no longer radially symmetric when these effects are included.",
Cross submissions,Detector Correlations and Null Tests of the Coherent State Hypothesis,"Sreenath K. Manikandan,Frank Wilczek",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We discuss the statistics of correlations between two resonant detectors. We show that this allows simple null tests of the coherent state hypothesis, free of vacuum (quantum) noise. Complementary aspects of the radiation field, {\it e.g.}, squeezing in number or phase, can be revealed through appropriate detection strategies.",
Cross submissions,AdS$_3$ black holes with primary Proca hair from regularized Gauss-Bonnet coupling,"Gokhan Alkac,Murat Mesta,Gonul Unal",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We construct a consistent three-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory as a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class by employing a regularization procedure based on the Weyl geometry, which was introduced recently inarXiv:2504.13084. We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static, and circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair. Afterwards, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet coupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further generalize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge.",
Cross submissions,Tidal disruptions of close white dwarf binaries by intermediate mass black holes,"Aryabrat Mahapatra,Adarsh Pandey,Pritam Banerjee,Tapobrata Sarkar",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We perform a suite of numerical simulations of tidal disruption events, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for a close binary system consisting of two low-mass white dwarfs, and an intermediate mass non-spinning black hole. The binary components are considered to be detached and on the same plane with the black hole. Our results quantify how the outcomes of these events depend crucially on the positional configuration of the binary components at the orbital pericenter, and we also show how distinctive behaviour for non-identical mass binaries arise, as compared to identical ones. We highlight these differences on observables such as mass fallback rates, kick velocities and gravitational waves, and also compute clump formation time within the stellar debris. In our setup, prograde binary motion, where the angular momentum of the binary is in the same direction as that of the center of mass motion around the black hole, is qualitatively similar to multiple events of single star tidal disruptions. However, we argue that interactions between stellar debris in the corresponding retrograde scenarios result in different and distinct outcomes. Our results should serve as indicative benchmarks in the observational aspects of tidal interactions between close white dwarf binaries and intermediate mass black holes.",
Cross submissions,Mechanical Characterisation of Silicon for the ETpathfinder Test Masses,"Guido Alex Iandolo,Alex Amato,Gianpietro Cagnoli,Alessandro Delmonte,Jan-Simon Hennig,Margot Hennig,Sebastian Steinlechner,Janis Wöhler,Stefan Hild,Jessica Steinlechner",Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The next generation of gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, is designed to reduce noise in a wide band of frequencies compared to the current generation, through the use of new technologies. ETpathfinder, designed as an R&D facility for these technologies, is a prototype for which the mirrors were chosen to be made of crystalline silicon, produced by the Leibniz-Institut für Kristallzüchtung. This material choice was made to pave the way for a low thermal noise level at cryogenic temperatures in the Einstein Telescope. This paper shows the mechanical loss of silicon designated to become the test masses for ETpathfinder in the range between room temperature and 53K. In addition, the effect of the anisotropic nature of silicon on the measurement procedure is addressed. Predictions are made of the contribution of the mirror substrate material to the overall ETpathfinder noise budget.",
Cross submissions,Regular Rotating Black Hole: Probing the boundaries of the Radiative Signatures and Jet Power,"Subhadip Sau,John W. Moffat",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We perform a detailed observational analysis of several galactic X-ray binaries, focusing on the interplay between black hole spin, jet power, and radiative efficiency within the context of Blandford-Znajek-powered jets. Using updated measurements from continuum fitting and Fe-line methods, we constrain the spin parameter a and the deviation parameter $\beta$ for five key black hole systems: H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS 1915+105. For each system, we compare the allowed parameter spaces derived independently from observed radiative efficiencies and emitted jet powers under different assumptions for the jet Lorentz factor $\Gamma=2,5$. By overlapping these observational constraints with theoretical expectations for regular black holes, we assess the viability of various spin-deviation combinations in explaining the observed phenomena. Our results reveal significant restrictions on the allowed values of $\beta$, with typical upper bounds around 0.38 - 0.4, except for rapidly spinning sources where the constraint becomes notably tighter. We further present a modified method for generating rotating solutions from static regular black hole spacetimes and provide a robust theoretical framework for relating jet power to black hole angular frequency in curved geometries. We also find that the theoretical jet power is modified by regularization factor for regular black holes. These findings place stringent observational bounds on deviations from the Kerr geometry and provide important insight into the astrophysical mechanisms powering accreting stellar-mass black holes.",
Cross submissions,Automated Algorithmic Discovery for Gravitational-Wave Detection Guided by LLM-Informed Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search,"He Wang,Liang Zeng",Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset. High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.",
