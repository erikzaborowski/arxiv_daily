New submissions,"Durgapal-Fuloria Bose-Einstein condensate stars within $ f(R,T) $ gravity theory","Meghanil Sinha,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This manuscript studies the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stars in the light of $ f(R,T) $ gravity here with Durgapal-Fuloria (DP) metric ansatz. The function under this study features as $ f(R,T) = R + 2\eta T $, where $ \eta $ represents the coupling constant. With the help of it, we have formulated a stellar model describing the isotropic matter here within. Our analysis covers energy conditions, equation of state (EoS) parameter and gradients of the energy-momentum tensor components for a valid BEC stellar framework within $ f(R,T) $ gravitational theory with satisfactory results. The model's stability has been validated via multiple stability criteria viz., the velocity of sound, study of adiabetic index and surface redshift where all are found to be lying within the acceptable range for our stellar model. Thus in all the cases we have found our model to be stable and realistic. From the graphical representations the impact of the coupling constant and the parameter of the DP metric potential are clearly visible. Thus we can state that with all the above-mentioned features we have introduced new stellar solutions for BEC stars with enhanced precise results in this modified gravity.",
New submissions,Operator Ordering in the Relativistic Quantization and its Thermodynamic Implications,"Karol Sajnok,Kacper Dębski",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We introduce a covariant canonical quantization for a particle in curved spacetime that tracks operator-ordering ambiguities. Parameterizing spatial and temporal ordering, we derive a Hermitian Hamiltonian with leading quantum-relativistic corrections. In a uniformly accelerated frame, we show the semiclassical heat-capacity approximation misses these effects and then develop a perturbative quantum treatment using Airy-function modes to obtain analytical first- and second-order energy shifts. Including these shifts in the partition function yields nontrivial, ordering-dependent specific-heat corrections. Numerical studies for electrons in extreme electric fields and ultra-light particles in strong gravitational fields demonstrate that these corrections become significant at intermediate temperatures. Enforcing the Tolman-Ehrenfest relation for spatial temperature variation further modulates the heat-capacity profile. Our results suggest that precision calorimetry in laser-acceleration or analogue gravity setups could probe quantum-ordering effects in relativistic regimes.",
New submissions,Scattering and absorption of massless scalar waves by a ModMax black hole,"Arturo Quispe Baptista,M. L. Peñafiel",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"ModMax electrodynamics is a remarkable example of nonlinear electrodynamics that preserves both conformal and duality invariance. When coupled to General Relativity, the resulting black hole solutions introduce a tunable nonlinearity parameter that effectively screens the electromagnetic charge. We study the scattering and absorption of massless scalar waves by a ModMax black hole by applying the partial waves method. We also compute some well-known analytical approximations for the scattering and absorption cross sections and contrast them with the full numerical solution. Our results adequately reproduce those of Maxwell electrodynamics in the appropriate limit and illustrate the effect of the charge screening in ModMax electrodynamics.",
New submissions,Modeling Relative Peak Times of Gravitational Wave Harmonics,"Anuj Kankani,Sean McWilliams",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Accurate modeling of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is essential for extracting their rich physics. A key detail for understanding the physics of mergers is predicting the precise time when the amplitude of the gravitational wave strain peaks, which can differ significantly among the different harmonic modes. We propose two semi-analytical methods to predict these differences using the same three inputs from Numerical Relativity (NR): the remnant mass and spin and the instantaneous frequency of each mode at its peak amplitude. The first method uses the frequency evolution predicted by the Backwards-One-Body model, while the second models the motion of an equatorial timelike geodesic in the remnant black hole spacetime. We compare our models to the SXS waveform catalog for quasi-circular, non-precessing systems and find excellent agreement for $l = |m|$ modes up to $l=8$, with mean and median differences from NR below 1$M$ in nearly all cases across the parameter space. We compare our results to the differences predicted by leading Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate waveform models and find that in cases corresponding to the largest timing differences, our models can provide significant increases in accuracy.",
New submissions,Particle dynamics and optical appearance of charged spherically symmetric black holes in bumblebee gravity,"Mou Xu,Jianbo Lu,Ruonan Li,Yu Liu,Shu-Min Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we study the particle dynamics, shadow, and optical appearance of charged black holes (BHs) in bumblebee gravity. Firstly, we find that the Lorentz-violation parameter l and charge parameter Q have opposite effects on the peak of the effective potential by analyzing timelike geodesics, and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) decreases as the BH parameters l and Q increase. We also explore the behaviors of particle energy, angular momentum, and Keplerian frequency. Secondly, for null geodesics, both the photon sphere radius and the shadow radius decrease with increasing l and Q, and are consistently smaller than those of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole (RNBH) and Schwarzschild-like BH. And based on observational data reported by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration, we constrain the parameters l and Q by using the shadow radius data of Sgr A*. Thirdly, we explore the observation characteristics of charged BHs under three thin disk accretion models. The results show that, compared to RNBH, the increase of l leads to a greater thickness of the photon rings and lensed rings. However, due to their extremely narrow ranges, the contributions are small, and the observed intensities are mainly contributed by the direct emissions. Moreover, when the parameter l is fixed, the peaks of the observed intensities of rings decrease with increasing Q for the same emission model, and it is always lower than the corresponding value for Schwarzschild-like BH. These findings contribute to distinguishing bumblebee charged black holes (BCBHs) from other types of BHs based on their optical appearance.",
New submissions,Black Hole Spectroscopy with Conditional Variational Autoencoder,Akash K Mishra,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Gravitational waves provide a unique opportunity to test general relativity in the strong-field regime, enabling the extraction of key physical parameters from observational data. Traditional likelihood-based inference methods, while robust, become computationally expensive in high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as when incorporating multiple ringdown modes or beyond Kerr deviations. In this paper, we explore the implementation of a conditional variational autoencoder-based machine-learning framework for accelerated ringdown parameter estimation. As a first application, we use the neural network to infer the remnant properties of a final black hole under the Kerr hypothesis. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm with simulated ringdown waveforms consistent with advanced LIGO sensitivity and compare with Bayesian analysis results. We further extend the framework beyond the Kerr paradigm by incorporating deviations predicted in braneworld gravity.",
New submissions,Correspondence between 3BF and Einstein-Cartan formulations of quantum gravity,"Pavle Stipsic,Marko Vojinovic",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We construct a correspondence between the quantized constrained 3BF theory and the quantized Einstein-Cartan theory with contact spin-spin interaction, both of which describe the Standard Model coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravitational field. First we introduce the expectation values of observables using the path integral formalism for both theories, and then by integrating out some configuration space variables in the quantum 3BF theory we obtain the definition of the corresponding observable in the quantum Einstein-Cartan theory with contact interaction. Finally, we discuss the differences in the predictions of the two theories on the example of the 4-volume density of spacetime, and on the example of gravitational waves.",
New submissions,Dark matter admixed relativistic stars: Structural properties and tidal Love numbers,"Takol Tangphati,Grigoris Panotopoulos,Ayan Banerjee,Anirudh Pradhan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"We study the impact of bosonic, self-interacting dark matter on structural properties and tidal deformabilities of compact stars. As far as the gravitational theory is concerned, we assume Einstein's gravity in four dimensions with a vanishing cosmological constant. Regarding matter content, we consider a state-of-matter to a linear form of equation-of-state (EoS), while for dark matter we assume a quartic scalar potential, which implies a certain non-linear EoS obtained long time ago. Adopting the two-fluid formalism we integrate the structure equations as well as the Riccati equation for the metric even perturbations imposing appropriate initial conditions at the center of the stars and matching conditions at their surface. We compute the stellar mass and radius, factor of compactness and dimensionless deformability varying several free parameters of the model studied here. Tidal deformability and the corresponding tidal Love number determine the imprint of the underlying EoS within the signals emitted during binary coalescences, and it is expected to be altered due to the presence of dark matter inside the objects. We find that in all cases considered here, the dimensionless deformability of the canonical stellar mass remains lower than the upper bound, $\Lambda_{1.4} < 800$. We also look at the stability of these stars based on the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion under various conditions. It is observed that the presence of dark matter implies significantly lower highest stellar mass, and also smaller and more compact stars for a given stellar mass.",
New submissions,Four-function generalization and separable structures of the Plebanski spacetime with sources,"Alfonso S. Acevedo,Nora Breton",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We determine a four-function generalization of the Plebanski spacetime, depending on three arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate, and one function on the angular coordinate. For the generalized Plebanski spacetime, we analyze the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equations, and the trajectories of charged test particles are derived from the motion constants. The Klein-Gordon equation separability is established and the Killing horizons are presented as well. Then we introduce a conformal factor to the Plebanski metric and discuss the conditions that preserve the separability. Finally we show a possible stress--energy tensor that may be the source of some of the generalized metrics.",
New submissions,Distinguishing scale-dependent Planck stars from renormalization group improved Schwarzschild black holes by Gravitational waves,Li Huang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a stellar-mass black hole orbiting a supermassive black hole, are among the primary targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors. By analyzing the emitted gravitational wave signals, we can probe the nature of compact objects in the strong-field region. To achieve this, we examine the effects of gravitational radiation. In this work, we base our calculations on the general relativistic Schwarzschild background and calculate the energy and angular momentum fluxes of gravitational waves. We perform a theoretical analysis of the equations of motion and the orbital evolution equations for EMRIs. The gravitational waveforms generated by the different periodic orbits of timelike test particles around scale-dependent Planck stars or renormalization group improved Schwarzschild black holes are investigated using both time-domain and frequency-domain methods. The time-domain method employs the ``analytic kludge"" (AK) approach, while the frequency-domain method utilizes the discrete Fourier transform. We calculate the characteristic strain of the corresponding gravitational waves and compare them with the sensitivity curves of both ground-based and space-based detectors. These gravitational wave sensitivity curves can be experimentally tested for both spacetimes considered. Additionally, we use two approximate methods--the large eccentricity (EL) method and the small eccentricity (ES) method--to study the orbital evolution of EMRIs and compare the results with equatorial orbits derived from geodesic equations. Our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the nature of spacetime.",
New submissions,"Resolving space-time singularities in spherically symmetric black holes: geodesic completeness, curvature scalars, and tidal forces","Haroldo C. D. Lima Junior,Renan B. Magalhães,Gonzalo J. Olmo,Diego Rubiera-Garcia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The existence of black holes in the Universe is nowadays established on the grounds of a blench of astrophysical observations, most notably those of gravitational waves from binary mergers and the imaging of supermassive objects at the heart of M87 and Milky Way galaxies. However, this success of Einstein's General Relativity~(GR) to connect theory of black holes with observations is also the source of its doom, since Penrose's theorem proves that, under physically sensible conditions, the development of a space-time singularity (as defined by the existence of a focal point for some geodesic paths in finite affine time) within black holes as described by GR is unavoidable. In this work, we thoroughly study how to resolve space-time singularities in spherically symmetric black holes. To do it so we find the conditions on the metric functions required for the restoration of geodesic completeness without any regards to the specific theory of the gravitational and matter fields supporting the amended metric. Our discussion considers both the usual trivial radial coordinate case and the bouncing radial function case and arrives to two mechanisms for this restoration: either the focal point is displaced to infinite affine distance or a bounce prevents the focusing of geodesics. Several explicit examples of well known (in)complete space-times are given. Furthermore, we consider the connection of geodesic (in)completeness with another criterion frequently used in the literature to monitor singular space-times: the blow up of (some sets of) curvature scalars and the infinite tidal forces they could bring with them, and discuss the conditions required for the harmlessness upon physical observers according to each criterion.",
New submissions,Quantum-inspired wormholes from String T-Duality,"Francisco S. N. Lobo,Manuel E. Rodrigues",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The intrinsic non-perturbative features of string-theoretic corrections, particularly those arising from T-duality, have been shown to naturally introduce an effective ultraviolet (UV) cutoff into the gravitational framework. This cutoff, often referred to as the zero-point length in the context of path integral duality, acts as a fundamental minimal length scale that regulates short-distance divergences. Using the established correspondence between T-duality and path integral duality, it has been shown that the static Newtonian potential becomes regularized at small distances. Building upon this regular behavior, we proceed to construct self-consistent, spherically symmetric, and electrically neutral wormhole solutions, which remain free of curvature singularities and embodies the effects of this duality-induced UV completion. We explore wormhole configurations with the aim of minimizing violations of the null energy condition (NEC). In fact, solutions with a constant redshift function or specific shape functions generally exhibit NEC violations throughout the entire spacetime. To address this, we explore two distinct thin shell constructions: (i) wormholes formed by matching an interior wormhole geometry to an exterior Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime, thereby confining exotic matter to a localized region; and (ii) standard thin-shell wormholes generated by gluing two identical black hole spacetimes across a timelike hypersurface situated outside their event horizons. In both cases, the NEC violations are minimised and restricted to a finite region, improving the physical plausibility and traversability of the resulting configurations.",
New submissions,Static Spherical Vacuum Solution to Bumblebee Gravity with Time-like VEVs,"Hao Li,Jie Zhu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the bumblebee field \(B_\mu\) has a time-like vacuum expectation value \(b_\mu\) is studied. We show that in general curved spacetime solutions are not allowed and only the Minkowski spacetime exists. However, it is surprising that a non-trivial solution can be obtained so long as a unique condition for the vacuum expectation \(b^2\equiv -b^\mu b_\mu=2/\kappa\), where \(\kappa=8\pi G\) is satisfied. We argue that naturally this solution is not stable since quantum corrections would invalidate the likely numerical coincidence, unless there are some unknown \emph{fine-tuning} mechanisms preventing any deviation from this condition. Nevertheless, some properties of this novel but peculiar solution are discussed, and we show that the extremal Reissner-Nordstr{ö}m solution is a limit of one of our solutions.",
New submissions,Investigating QED Effects on the Thin Accretion Disk Properties Around Rotating Euler-Heisenberg Black Holes,"Kourosh Nozari,Sara Saghafi,Fatemeh Aliyan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The Einstein Euler Heisenberg (EEH) black hole model represents an extension of classical black hole solutions in general relativity by incorporating quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections. These corrections are introduced through the inclusion of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, which accounts for the nonlinear effects of QED in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. This study investigates the observational properties of a thin accretion disk surrounding the electrically charged rotating EEH black hole. By exploring the influence of the spin parameter and charge on key dynamical quantities such as the energy, angular momentum, angular velocity, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a test particle it becomes possible to analyze the radiative flux, temperature distribution, and differential luminosity of the thin accretion disk in the spacetime of the charged rotating EEH black hole. The results are compared to those of Kerr and Kerr Newman black holes in General relativity, revealing that QED corrections are found to increase the ISCO radius. Specifically, for a fixed electric charge, an increasing spin parameter leads to a larger ISCO radius compared to the standard Kerr black holes as a result of additional electromagnetic corrections introduced by the Euler Heisenberg theory. Conversely, when the spin parameter is held constant, an increase in the electric charge reduces the ISCO radius. Additionally, thin accretion disks around charged EEH rotating black holes exhibit higher temperatures and greater efficiency when the spin parameter is fixed and the electric charge is increased.",
New submissions,"Two-sided NED black-hole, naked-singularity, and soliton solutions",Mustapha Azreg-Aïnou,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We consider non-linear electrodynamics (NED) minimally coupled to general relativity. We derive novel electrically charged, spherically symmetric, black-hole solutions having, for some set of parameters, all their NED fields (the electric field and the square of the electromagnetic field) regular for all values of the radial coordinate. For another set of parameters, the NED fields and the Kretschmann scalar are regular as the radial coordinate runs from one spatial infinity to another spatial infinity without the metric being a wormhole. We obtain solutions that have two distinct or the same asymptotic behaviors (two spatial infinities) with equal or unequal ADM masses and solutions with always one horizon whatever the ratio of the electric charge to mass. We comment on some regularity theorems and generalize them to multi-valued NED Lagrangians. The derived regular solutions do not violate the Weak Energy Condition.",
New submissions,"On some properties of that strange component of Nature called ""time""",Maurizio Gasperini,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),Are time-travels possible? is the past still existing? and is the future already existing? We try to give an answer to these an other questions concerning the properties of time and the close connection (but deep physical difference) between time and space.,
New submissions,Asymptotia of Kerr-de Sitter Black Holes,"Samuel Blitz,Jarosław Kopiński",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"Exterior geometries of physical black holes are believed to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter spacetime at late times. A characteristic feature of that vacuum Einstein solution is the presence of a hidden symmetry generated by a closed conformal Killing--Yano tensor. Using this symmetry and modern conformal geometry technology, we find necessary conditions for generic solutions to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter metric. Further, we constrain the admissible form of the geometric free data on the conformal infinity giving rise to this family of spacetimes and constrain it in terms of the stress-energy tensor.",
New submissions,Greybody factors of charged black holes with axion hair,"Ratchaphat Nakarachinda,Petarpa Boonserm,Antonio De Felice,Shinji Tsujikawa,Pitayuth Wongjun",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the greybody factor of charged hairy black holes (BHs) that arise due to the presence of an axion coupled to the electromagnetic field. Specifically, we consider spin-0 and spin-1 test particles propagating in the background of BHs with axion hair, where the spacetime geometry is modified compared to that of the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) BH. In contrast to the RN solution, with a given total BH charge, the effective potential for test particles depends on the ratio of electric to magnetic charges. In other words, charged BHs with axion hair breaks the electric-magnetic duality present in the RN solution. We compute the transmission coefficient of test particles plunging into the charged hairy BH and find that the deviation from the RN solution is particularly evident for higher multipole moments. Precise measurements of greybody factors can thus serve as probes for the possible existence of axions coupled to the electromagnetic field, as well as potential signatures of magnetic monopoles.",
New submissions,Gravitational-Wave Background from Extragalactic Double White Dwarfs for LISA,"Guillaume Boileau,Tristan Bruel,Alexandre Toubiana,Astrid Lamberts,Nelson Christensen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent studies have revealed the contribution of extragalactic DWD to the astrophysical SGWB could be detectable in the mHz regime by LISA. Conversely, the presence of this SGWB could hamper the detection of cosmological SGWB, which are one of the key targets of GW astronomy. We aim to confirm the spectrum of the extragalactic DWD SGWB and estimate its detectability with LISA under different assumptions. We also aim at understanding the main uncertainties in the spectrum and estimate if the signal could be anisotropic. We use population synthesis code COSMIC with several assumptions on binary evolution and initial conditions. We incorporate a specific treatment to account for the mass transfer and tidal torques after DWDs formation. Our study is in global agreement with previous studies, although we find a lower contribution at high frequencies, due to a different treatment of mass transfer in stellar binaries. We find that the uncertainties in the amplitude are dominated by the SFR model, and to a lesser degree by the binary evolution model. The inclusion of tidal effects and mass transfer episodes in DWDs can change the amplitude of the estimated SGWB up to a factor 3 at the highest frequencies. For all the models, we find that this SGWB could be potentially observable by LISA after 4 years. Under the hypothesis of an homogeneous Universe beyond 200Mpc, anisotropies associated to the astrophysical population of DWDs will likely not be detectable. We provide fits of this SGWB under different assumptions to be used by the community. We demonstrate variability in SGWB predictions, emphasizing uncertainties due to different astrophysical assumptions. We highlight the importance of determining the position of the knee in the SGWB spectrum, as it provides insights on mass transfer models. The prediction of this SGWB is of critical importance for LISA in the context of observing other SGWB.",
New submissions,From Barthel Randers Kropina Geometries to the Accelerating Universe: A Brief Review of Recent Advances in Finslerian Cosmology,"Amine Bouali,Himanshu Chaudhary,Lehel Csillag,Rattanasak Hama,Tiberiu Harko,Sorin V. Sabau,Shahab Shahidi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We review recent developments in cosmological models based on Finsler geometry and extensions of general relativity within this framework. Finsler geometry generalizes Riemannian geometry by allowing the metric tensor to depend on position and an additional internal degree of freedom, typically represented by a vector field at each point of the spacetime manifold. We explore whether Finsler-type geometries can describe gravitational interaction and cosmological dynamics. In particular, we examine the Barthel connection and $(\alpha, \beta)$ geometries, where $\alpha$ is a Riemannian metric and $\beta$ is a one-form. For a specific construction of $\beta$, the Barthel connection coincides with the Levi-Civita connection of the associated Riemann metric. We review gravitational field and cosmological evolution in three geometries: Barthel-Randers ($F = \alpha + \beta$), Barthel-Kropina ($F = \alpha^2 \beta$), and the conformally transformed Barthel-Kropina geometry. After presenting the mathematical foundations of Finslerian-type modified gravity theories, we derive generalized Friedmann equations in these geometries assuming a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker type metric. We also present the matter-energy balance equations, interpreting them from the perspective of thermodynamics with particle creation. The cosmological properties of Barthel-Randers and Barthel-Kropina models are explored in detail. The additional geometric terms in these models can be interpreted as an effective dark energy component, generating an effective cosmological constant. Several cosmological solutions are compared with observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) using MCMC analysis. A comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model shows that Finslerian models fit observational data well, suggesting they offer a viable alternative to general relativity.",
New submissions,Observational constraints on inflationary models with non-minimally derivative coupling by ACT,"Qing Gao,Yanjiang Qian,Yungui Gong,Zhu Yi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The most recent data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) reveals a larger value of the scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, ruling out a broad class of inflationary attractors. In this paper, we consider inflationary models including the power law potential, the hilltop model, the polynomial $\alpha$-attractor and exponential $\alpha-$attractor, with non-minimally derivative coupling in the high friction limit, and show how the models can fit ACT data. We also derive constraints on the model parameters using the latest ACT data.",
New submissions,Observable signatures of Black Holes with Hernquist Dark Matter Halo having a cloud of strings: From Geodesics to Shadow,"Faizuddin Ahmed,Ahmad Al-Badawi,İzzet Sakallı",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of a novel black hole (BH) spacetime: a Schwarzschild BH embedded in a Hernquist-type dark matter halo (HDMH) and surrounded by a cloud of cosmic strings (CSs) -- collectively termed the Schwarzschild-HDMH with CS (SHDMHCS) configuration. By analyzing the spacetime geometry, we explore how key parameters -- the core radius and halo density of the dark matter, along with the string tension -- affect the geodesic motion of both massless and massive particles. Our results reveal that the combined influence of HDMH and CSs modifies the effective potentials for null and timelike geodesics, leading to distinct dynamical behavior compared to standard Schwarzschild geometry. We perform a perturbative analysis for scalar (spin-0), electromagnetic (spin-1), and Dirac (spin-1/2) fields, deriving the associated effective potentials and showing how both the dark halo and CSs alter field propagation and potential barriers. The shadow of the BH is studied in detail: we derive analytical expressions for photon sphere and shadow radii, finding that CSs tend to enlarge the shadow, while HDMH properties tend to shrink it. The combined effects of these parameters significantly influence the shadow's shape and size, producing potentially observable signatures. Our results establish that the SHDMHCS configuration yields distinct observational imprints detectable by present and forthcoming astrophysical instruments. This framework provides new tools for probing exotic matter distributions via gravitational wave observations, orbital dynamics, and high-resolution black hole imaging, offering a pathway to distinguish such configurations from simpler BH models in realistic environments.",
New submissions,A numerical approach to particle creation in accelerating toy models,"Pedro Duarte Baptista,Alex Vañó-Viñuales,Adrían del Río Vega",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The formation of black holes by the gravitational collapse of stars is known to spontaneously excite particle pairs out of the quantum vacuum. For the canonical vacuum state at past null infinity, the expected number of particles received at future null infinity can be obtained in full closed form at sufficiently late times. However, for intermediate times, or for more complicated astrophysical processes (e.g. binary black hole mergers), the problem is technically challenging and has not yet been resolved. We develop here a numerical approach to study scattering problems of massless quantum fields in asymptotically flat spacetimes, based on the hyperboloidal slice method used in numerical relativity and perturbation theory. This promising approach can reach both past and future null infinities, and therefore it has the potential to address the Hawking scattering problem more rigorously than evolution on the usual Cauchy slices. We test this approach with some dynamical toy models in Minkowski using effective potentials that mimic the effects of gravity, and compute the spectrum of particles received at future null infinity. We finally discuss future prospects for applying this framework in more relevant gravitational scenarios.",
New submissions,Quasibound states of massive charged scalars around dilaton black holes in $2+1$ dimensions: Exact frequencies,H. S. Vieira,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In this work, we investigate massive charged scalar perturbations in the background of three-dimensional dilaton black holes with a cosmological constant. We demonstrate that the wave equations governing the dynamics of these perturbations are exactly solvable, with the radial part expressible in terms of confluent Heun functions. The quasibound state frequencies are computed analytically, and we examine their dependence on the scalar field's mass and charge, as well as on the black hole's mass and electric charge. Our analysis also underscores the crucial role played by the cosmological constant in shaping the behavior of these perturbations. This specific black hole metric arises as a solution to the low-energy effective action of string theory in $2+1$ dimensions, and it holds potential for experimental realization in analog gravity systems due to the similarity between its surface gravity and that of acoustic analogs. Moreover, the analytic tractability of this system offers a valuable testing ground for exploring aspects of black hole spectroscopy, stability, and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The exact solvability facilitates deeper insights into the interplay between geometry and matter fields in lower-dimensional gravity, where quantum gravitational effects can be more pronounced. Such studies not only enrich our understanding of dilaton gravity and its string-theoretic implications but also pave the way for potential applications in simulating black hole phenomena in laboratory settings using analog models.",
New submissions,Local d'Alembertian for causal sets,"Marián Boguñá,Dmitri Krioukov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Causal set theory is an intrinsically nonlocal approach to quantum gravity, inheriting its nonlocality from Lorentzian nonlocality. This nonlocality causes problems in defining differential operators -- such as the d'Alembert operator, a cornerstone of any relativistic field theory -- within the causal set framework. It has been proposed that d'Alembertians in causal sets must themselves be nonlocal to respect causal set nonlocality. However, we show that such nonlocal d'Alembertians do not converge to the standard continuum d'Alembertian for some basic fields. To address this problem, we introduce a local d'Alembert operator for causal sets and demonstrate its convergence to its continuum counterpart for arbitrary fields in Minkowski spacetimes. Our construction leverages recent developments in measuring both timelike and spacelike distances in causal sets using only their intrinsic structure. This approach thus reconciles locality with Lorentz invariance, and paves a way toward defining converging discrete approximations to locality-based differential operators even in theories that are inherently nonlocal.",
New submissions,Identifying multiple images of gravitational-wave sources lensed by elliptical lensing potentials,"Saif Ali,Michael Kesden,Lindsay King",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Real astrophysical lenses typically lack axisymmetry, necessitating the study of gravitational-wave (GW) lensing by elliptical mass distributions to accurately assess detectability and waveform interpretation. We investigate strong lensing using the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, which produces two or four images depending on the source's position relative to lens caustics. Employing a quasi-geometrical optics framework, we determine that the geometrical-optics approximation holds reliably for lens masses above approximately $10^5 \, M_\odot$ at GW frequencies relevant for ground-based detectors $(\sim 10^2 \,\text{Hz})$, though wave-optics effects become significant for lower masses or sources near caustics. Our waveform mismatch analysis demonstrates that the use of three-image templates significantly improves our ability to distinguish source signals, reducing mismatches from $O(10^{-1})$ to $O(10^{-2})$, typically by factors between 1.5 and 5 compared to the standard two-image template model. At lens masses above $10^7 \, M_\odot$, diffraction effects become negligible for ground-based detectors, resulting in an additional mismatch reduction by a factor of approximately three. These findings highlight the critical need for multi-image templates in GW searches to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy.",
New submissions,The gravitational wave echoes from the black hole with three-form fields,"Natthason Autthisin,Supakchai Ponglertsakul,Daris Samart",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we study of massless three-form black hole, where the three-form fields are higher $p$-form gauge fields with $p=3$. These give rise to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (Sch-dS)-like solution through an effective cosmological constant represented by $a_1$. We analyze this solution under gravitational perturbations and find that it exhibits a single-peak potential. For this case, no echoes are produced. Furthermore, we consider the massive case of the three-form fields by introducing a Stueckelberg field to restore gauge invariance and to investigate its effect on GWs at late times. In this case, the potential exhibits a double-peak structure, with the modified potential appearing beside the gravitational perturbation potential. We also examine the impact of the relevant parameters as well as the influence of the parameter $c_0$, which arises from the equation of motion of the Stueckelberg field. For a large value of $a_1$, the two peaks of the potentials are close together, while $c_0$ affects the amplitude and decay rate of the time-domain waveform, resulting in no echoes. For small values of $a_1$, the peaks of the potentials are widely separated and $c_0$ influences both the phase and the amplitude of the echoes. In addition, the quasinormal frequencies of the black hole are also calculated using both the WKB and Prony methods.

Following the construction of such admixed configurations, we derive the equilibrium and adiabatic speeds of sound therein, leading to a computation of the star's $g$-mode spectrum in the Cowling approximation. In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.",
Cross submissions,Phase transitions in a holographic superfluid model with non-linear terms beyond the probe limit,"Zi-Qiang Zhao,Zhang-Yu Nie,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the holographic s-wave superfluid model with 4th and 6th power self-interaction terms $\lambda |\psi|^4$ and $\tau |\psi|^6$ with considering the full back-reaction of the matter fields on the metric in the 3+1 dimensional bulk. The self-interaction terms are good at controlling the condensate to realize various phase transitions, such as the zeroth-order, first-order, and second-order phase transitions within the single condensate s-wave superfluid model. Therefore, in this work, we are able to investigate the influence of the back-reaction strength on the various phase transitions, including the zeroth and first order phase transitions. In addition, we confirm that the influence of the 4th and 6th power terms on the superfluid phase transition in the case of finite back-reaction are qualitative the same as in the probe limit, thus present universality. We also plot the special value $\lambda_s$ of the parameter $\lambda$ at different back-reaction strength, below which the condensate grows to an opposite direction and is important in controlling the order of the superfluid phase transitions. Comparing the influence of the back-reaction parameter and that of the higher-order nonlinear coefficients, we see that the back-reaction strength brings in both the effective couplings similar to the 4th power and 6th power terms.",
Cross submissions,Towards relational foundations for spacetime quantum physics,"Pietro Dall'Olio,José A. Zapata",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics tells us that the description of a system in the formalism of quantum mechanics is not an absolute, but it is relative to the observer itself. The interpretation goes further and proposes a set of axioms. In standard non relational language, one of them states that an observer can only retrieve finite amount information from a system by means of measurement. Our contribution starts with the observation that quantum mechanics, i.e. quantum field theory (QFT) in dimension 1, radically differs from QFT in higher dimensions. In higher dimensions boundary data (or initial data) cannot be specified by means of finitely many measurements. This calls for a notion of measuring scale, which we provide. At a given measuring scale the observer has partial information about the system. Our notion of measuring scale generalizes the one implicitly used in Wilsonian QFT, where at each measuring scale there are effective theories, which may be corrected, and if the theory turns out to be renormalizable the mentioned corrections converge to determine a completely corrected (or renormalized) theory at the given measuring scale. The notion of a measuring scale is the cornerstone of Wilsonian QFT. This notion tells us that we are not describing a system from an absolute perspective. An effective theory at that scale describes the system with respect to the observer, which may retrieve information from the system by means of measurement in a specific way determined by our notion of measuring scale. We claim that a relational interpretation of quantum physics for spacetimes of dimension greater than 1 is Wilsonian.",
Cross submissions,Time-frequency Imprints of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Confusion Gravitational Wave Background,"Lingyuan Ji,Liang Dai",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Detecting individual extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) is a major science goal of future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and TianQin. However, matched-filtering can be challenging as waveform templates are required to be accurate over tens of thousands of orbits. We introduce the time-frequency spectrum as an alternative observable that can be exploited to reveal the chirping of EMRIs at the population level. We analytically calculate this spectrum and its correlators for parameterized populations of slowly chirping sources on quasi-circular orbits, assuming a simplified model of the antenna response for a proof of concept. We then exploit this observable to distinguish between Galactic white dwarf binaries and a possible EMRI population, and quantify the precision at which EMRI population parameters can be determined through a Fisher analysis. We explore several scenarios of EMRI populations and find that this new method may allow us to determine EMRI population parameters at an accuracy level of several percent. Since white dwarf binaries have much longer chirping timescales than the EMRIs do, EMRI population properties can still be determined even if their stochastic gravitational wave background has a power spectrum two orders of magnitude weaker than that of the Galactic white dwarf binaries.",

Tunnell",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"We present MORRIS (Magnetic Oscillatory Resonator for Rare-Interaction Studies) and propose the first tabletop search for non-Newtonian gravity due to a Yukawa-like fifth force using a magnetically levitated particle.

Featuring short-, medium-, and long-term stages, MORRIS will admit increasing sensitivities to the force coupling strength $\alpha$, optimally probing screening lengths of $\lambda \sim 1\,\mathrm{mm}$. Our short-term setup provides a proof-of-principle study, with our medium- and long-term stages respectively constraining $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-5}$, leading over existing bounds. Our projections are readily recastable to concrete models predicting the existence of fifth forces, and our statistical analysis is generally applicable to well-characterized sinusoidal driving forces.

Cross submissions,Identifying Long Radio Transients with Accompanying X-Ray Emission as Disk-Jet Precessing Black Holes: The Case of ASKAP J1832-0911,Antonios Nathanail,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Aims: In this work we investigate whether the 2 min bursts every 44 min from ASKAP J1832-0911 can be explained by Lense-Thirring precession of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) accretion disk launching a Blandford-Znajek jet, as an alternative to magnetar or white-dwarf models. Methods: We derive the Lense-Thirring period $ P_{\rm LT}=\frac{\pi G M}{a c^3}r^3 $ and solve $P_{\rm LT}=44$ min for black-hole mass M and dimensionless radius $r=R/R_g$. We estimate the equipartition field B at r, compute the Blandford-Znajek power $P_{\rm BZ}$, and the power expected from a gap at the black hole magnetosphere, and compare the resulting jet luminosity to the observed radio and X-ray fluxes at $D\approx4.5$ kpc. We also evaluate expected high-frequency variability and the angular size for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. Results: For $a\sim0.3\!-\!0.9$, an IMBH with $M\sim10^3\!-\!10^5\,M_\odot$ yields $r\sim10\!-\!40\,R_g$ and $P_{\rm LT}=44$ min. Equipartition gives $B\sim10^5$ G at r, leading to $P_{\rm BZ}\sim10^{35\!-\!39}$ erg ${\rm s^{-1}}$. With radiative efficiency $\epsilon_j\sim10^{-2}\!-\!10^{-1}$, the predicted $L_{\rm jet}\sim10^{34\!-\!36}$ erg ${\rm s^{-1}}$ matches the observed $F_X\sim10^{-12}$ erg ${\rm cm^{-2}}$ ${\rm s^{-1}}$ and radio flux, variability on $\lesssim100$ s could be a smoking gun of this model. Conclusions:The IMBH precessing-jet model simultaneously explains the periodicity, energetics, and duty cycle of ASKAP J1832-0911. Only high-time-resolution X-ray timing (to check $\sim$s pulsations) and multi-frequency radio polarimetry can definitively distinguish it from magnetar or white-dwarf scenarios.",

We derive the consistent ICs for Horndeski theory in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach, assuming constant EFT functions at early times. We implement the ICs into the public Boltzmann code \texttt{EFTCAMB}, and demonstrate that the expected early-time behavior of perturbations and Weyl potential can be obtained with theory-consistent MG ICs. We identify significant deviations when comparing Cosmic Microwave Background angular power spectra in MG models obtained with consistent MG ICs versus inconsistent GR ICs. Our findings underline the importance of using accurate, theory-consistent MG ICs to ensure robust cosmological constraints on early MG models.",

Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,Å\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.",

The estimated power spectral density sensitivity at the resonant frequencies is of the order of $10^{-21}\, \textrm{strain}/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$. In this paper, after introducing the science opportunity and potential of gravitational wave detection with BAWs, we describe the two-stage BAUSCIA project plan to build a multimode antenna based on commercial BAWs, followed by an optimized array of custom BAWs. We show that commercially available BAWs already provide sensitivity comparable to current experiments around 10~MHz. Finally, we outline options for optimization of custom devices to improve sensitivity in an unexplored region, probe multiple frequencies between 0.1 and 10 MHz, and target specific signals, such as post-merger emission from neutron stars or emission from various dark matter candidates.",

In scenarios like early matter domination (EMD), the thermal DM relic is diluted and then replenished via non-thermal production, leaving characteristic imprints on the primordial GW spectrum, inducing frequency-dependent suppressions in the GW amplitudes. By analysing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and employing Fisher forecast, we show that upcoming GW experiments have good potential to probe the DM parameter space involving its mass and annihilation cross-section. We show, for instance, LISA will be sensitive to DM mass range $[2\times 10^2-10^5]$ GeV. Furthermore, we identify a significant overlap of the GW missions' sensitivity reaches with the projected reach of future indirect searches like CTA with gamma rays, ANTARES, KM3NeT with neutrinos. In those overlapping regions of interests, we forecast on the GW experiments to estimate the precision of measurements. We show, for instance, that DM mass of $10^5$ GeV with an annihilation cross-section of $10^{-24}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$, and a mass of $10^4$ GeV with an annihilation cross-section of $2\times10^{-25}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$, lie within the projections of CTA. We find that whilst the former can be probed by ET with $\sim 1\%$ uncertainties, the latter can be probed by $\mu$-ARES with $\sim 7 \%$ uncertainties. Similarly, DM mass of $10^5$ GeV, with cross-section $10^{-23}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$ lies within the projection of ANTARES and KM3NeT, which can be probed by ET with $\sim 1\%$ uncertainties.",

Results are presented for both triangular and L-shaped configurations for the experiment. Furthermore, in the case of the triangular configuration, we examine non-ideal optical cavity conditions, such as beam offsets and misalignments, and the presence of point absorbers in the mirrors, which can increase scattered light noise. This can be translated into future stringent constraints on the design and operating parameters of the interferometer, thus facilitating to achieve its sensitivity targets.",
Cross submissions,Supersymmetric Horizons at the Edge of Effective Field Theory,"Sermet Çağan,Omer Guleryuz,Cemal Berfu Senisik",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"What if supersymmetry is not something to be hidden, but something to be reached? We introduce the Supersymmetric Horizon Stabilization (SHS): a conceptually unified and analytically controlled framework for embedding metastable de Sitter vacua and trans-Planckian inflation within effective $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. Built from a logarithmic Kähler potential modified by nilpotent constraints, SHS yields a framework that connects the early universe's inflationary phase, intermediate metastable acceleration, and a final supersymmetric fixed point.We classify all viable models by imposing four essential criteria: absence of ghosts, de Sitter metastability, smooth Minkowski transitions, and asymptotic supersymmetry. The resulting scalar dynamics exhibit exponential field-space profiles, $\tau(\varphi) \sim e^{-\Delta\varphi}$, reconciling trans-Planckian excursions with bounded moduli. This structure ensures finite geodesic distance, stabilizes the gravitino mass, and suppresses light towers -- evading both the Gravitino and Swampland Distance Conjectures. Meanwhile, the divergent Euclidean cost of reaching the supersymmetric endpoint realizes the AdS and Generalized Swampland Distance Conjectures, confirming that the infrared boundary lies at infinite dynamical distance despite controlled scalar evolution.From this behavior emerges the Supersymmetric Horizon Conjecture: that consistent gravitational EFTs may begin and end with supersymmetry -- both at the origin and the asymptotic edge of cosmic evolution -- not as a fine-tuned remnant, but as a geometric boundary condition. SHS also supports localized features that transiently enhance scalar fluctuations, enabling efficient production of primordial black holes with masses far exceeding those in conventional inflationary scenarios.",
Cross submissions,Inferring Neutron Star Nuclear Properties from Gravitational-Wave and Gamma-Ray Burst Observations,"Hsin-Yu Chen,Ore Gottlieb",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex),"Recent discoveries of long gamma-ray bursts accompanied by kilonova emission prompted interest in understanding their progenitors. If these long-duration bursts arise from neutron star mergers, similar to short gamma-ray bursts, it raises the question of which physical properties govern burst duration. The mass of the merger stands out as a key factor, strongly influencing the lifetime of the merger remnant, which in turn determines the burst duration: lighter mergers that form long-lived remnants produce short bursts, whereas more massive mergers result in short-lived remnants that collapse into black holes, powering longer bursts. In this paper, we compare merger rates from gravitational-wave observations of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with the rates of kilonova-associated long and short gamma-ray bursts, to identify a characteristic total neutron star mass that separates the two burst classes at $1.36^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (median and 68\% confidence interval) times of the neutron star Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass. This result suggests that massive neutron stars could survive an extended period after merger. Our findings are robust against substantial observational uncertainties and model assumptions. Moreover, we uncover correlations among various characteristic masses tied to dense nuclear matter, introducing a novel and independent approach to constrain neutron star nuclear properties through separated and combined gravitational-wave and gamma-ray burst observations.",

Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15 year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.",

We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.",
Cross submissions,Stationary gravitational modes on Kerr-anti-de Sitter spacetimes,Olivier Graf,Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We prove that, for any continuous path of Kerr-adS black hole parameters crossing the Hawking-Reall threshold, for all azimuthal number $|m|$ sufficiently large, there exists black hole parameters on the path such that the Teukolsky equations with conformal boundary conditions admit a non-trivial regular stationary (\emph{i.e.} with frequency $\omega=m\omega_+$) mode solution. When $|m|$ goes to infinity, we show that these black hole parameters accumulate at the Hawking-Reall threshold. The major difficulty is that one cannot construct solutions to the system of Teukolsky equations using variational arguments as it is usually done for the classical wave equation. We introduce a new scheme of proof based on a shooting-type continuity argument and a high-frequency WKB approximation.",

Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram demonstrating the coexistence and interplay between the intrinsic Jeans instability of self-gravitating systems and the unstable tongues of parametric resonance. The phase diagram shows that reducing the driving frequency fragments and narrows parametric resonance structures while expanding the Jeans-dominated regime. We further identify a thermal-gravity competition in the Faraday wavevector, manifested as a sharp transition when thermal energy balances mean-field interaction at low driving frequencies. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal that Faraday wave patterns exhibit high sensitivity to Jeans frequency, transitioning from parametric resonance to Jeans collapse as gravitational strength increases.",

In four dimensions, the structure of these theories is well known. However, in dimensions larger than four, the behavior of the modes is so far unclear. In this work, we explore this question, studying the theories in conformally flat spacetimes as well as anisotropic backgrounds. First, we consider the pure theory in d-dimensions. We show that this theory propagates no degrees of freedom for flat space-time. Otherwise, we find the theory in the corresponding Einstein frame and show that it propagates a scalar field and two tensor modes, that arise from Einstein's gravity. We then consider conformal gravity in d dimensions. We argue on the number of degrees of freedom for conformally flat space-times and show that for $d>4$, there exists a frame in which this theory can be written as the Weyl-squared gravity with a cosmological constant, and also generalize this formulation to the $f\left(W^2\right)$ theories. Then, we consider the specific model of conformal gravity in five dimensions. We find the analytical and numerical solutions for the anisotropic Universe for this case, which admits super-Hubble and exponential expansions. Finally, we consider the perturbations around these solutions and study the number of the degrees of freedom.",

This approach is designed to enable field-level inference with data from Stage IV cosmological surveys. Building on the reaction method, which models the nonlinear matter power spectrum in modified gravity as corrections to a ""pseudo"" $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we extend the method to full field-level predictions by applying it to the output of $N$-body simulations, including both positions and velocities. We focus on modifications to gravity that are scale-independent at the linear level, allowing us to isolate and emulate nonlinear deviations, particularly screening effects. Our neural network predicts the field-level correction (""reaction"") to a pseudo$\Lambda$CDM simulation whose linear clustering matches that of the target. The emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy across a broad range of summary statistics, including 0.4\% agreement in the matter power spectrum at scales $k < 1$ Mpc$/h$, and 2\% accuracy in redshift-space distortion multipoles at $k < 0.3$ Mpc$/h$. We also validate the emulator against $N$-body simulations with increased force resolution and time steps, confirming the robustness of its performance. These results demonstrate that our framework is a practical and reliable tool for incorporating screened modified gravity models into field-level cosmological inference, enabling stringent tests of extra fundamental forces at cosmological scales.",
