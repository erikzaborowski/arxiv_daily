New submissions,II. Non-Linear Interacting Dark Energy: Analytical Solutions and Theoretical Pathologies,"Marcel van der Westhuizen,Amare Abebe,Eleonora Di Valentino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate interacting dark energy (IDE) models with phenomenological, non-linear interaction kernels $Q$, specifically $Q_{1}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm dm}\rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, $Q_{2}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, and $Q_{3}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$. Using dynamical system techniques developed in our companion paper on linear kernels, we derive new conditions that ensure positive and well-defined energy densities, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We find that for $Q_{1}$, all densities remain positive, while for $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ negative values of either DM or DE are unavoidable if energy flows from DM to DE. We also show that for $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ a big rip singularity always arises in the phantom regime $w<-1$, whereas for $Q_{3}$ this fate may be avoided if energy flows from DE to DM. In addition, we provide new exact analytical solutions for $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$ in the cases of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$, and obtain new expressions for the effective equations of state of DM, DE, the total fluid, and the reconstructed dynamical DE equation of state ($w_{\rm dm}^{\rm eff}$, $w_{\rm de}^{\rm eff}$, $w_{\rm tot}^{\rm eff}$, and $\tilde{w}$). Using these results, we discuss phantom crossings, evaluate how each kernel addresses the coincidence problem, and apply statefinder diagnostics to compare the models. These findings extend the theoretical understanding of non-linear IDE models and provide analytical tools for future observational constraints.",
New submissions,I. Linear Interacting Dark Energy: Analytical Solutions and Theoretical Pathologies,"Marcel van der Westhuizen,Amare Abebe,Eleonora Di Valentino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Interacting dark energy (IDE) models, in which dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) exchange energy through a non-gravitational interaction, have long been proposed as candidates to address key challenges in modern cosmology. These include the coincidence problem, the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, and, more recently, the hints of dynamical dark energy reported by the DESI collaboration. Given the renewed interest in IDE models, it is crucial to fully understand their parameter space when constraining them observationally, especially with regard to the often-neglected issues of negative energy densities and future big rip singularities. In this work, we present a comparative study of the general linear interaction $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm}\rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de}\rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$. For these five models, we perform a dynamical system analysis and derive new conditions that ensure positive, real, and well-defined energy densities throughout cosmic evolution, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We obtain exact analytical solutions for $\rho_{\rm{dm}}$, $\rho_{\rm{de}}$, the effective equations of state ($w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{dm}}$, $w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{de}}$, $w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{tot}}$), and a reconstructed dynamical DE equation of state $\tilde{w}$. Using these results, we examine phantom crossings, address the coincidence problem, and apply the statefinder diagnostic to distinguish between models. We show that energy transfer from DM to DE inevitably produces negative energy densities and make future singularities more likely, while transfer from DE to DM avoids these pathologies and is thus theoretically favored.",
New submissions,"III. Interacting Dark Energy: Summary of Models, Pathologies, and Constraints","Marcel van der Westhuizen,Amare Abebe,Eleonora Di Valentino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present an overview of the main results from our two companion papers that are relevant for observational constraints on interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We provide analytical solutions for the dark matter and dark energy densities, $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$, as well as the normalized Hubble function $h(z)$, for eight IDE models. These include five linear IDE models, namely $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de} \rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$, together with three non-linear IDE models: $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, and $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$. For these eight models, we present conditions to avoid imaginary, undefined, and negative energy densities. In seven of the eight cases, negative densities arise if energy flows from DM to DE, implying a strong theoretical preference for energy transfer from DE to DM. We also provide conditions to avoid future big rip singularities and evaluate how each model addresses the coincidence problem in both the past and the future. Finally, we propose a set of approaches and simplifying assumptions that can be used when constraining IDE models, by defining regimes that restrict the parameter space according to the behavior researchers are willing to tolerate.",
New submissions,Measuring the properties of homogeneous turbulence in curved spacetimes,"Rita Megale,Alejandro Cruz-Osorio,Giuseppe Ficarra,Mario Imbrogno,Claudio Meringolo,Leonardo Primavera,Luciano Rezzolla,Sergio Servidio",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph),"Turbulence in curved spacetimes in general, and in the vicinity of black holes (BHs) in particular, represents a poorly understood phenomenon that is often analysed employing techniques developed for flat spacetimes. We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.",
New submissions,Chaos in Horndeski cosmologies,Mikhail S. Volkov,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We analyze how a scalar field can affect the chaotic behaviour of homogeneous and isotropic Bianchi IX cosmologies. It is known that a massless, minimally coupled scalar field removes the chaos. However, in more general Horndeski theories, the situation is more complex. We find that in shift-symmetric $K$-essence theories, chaos persists if the scalar field contribution to the initial-value constraint is {\it subleading} compared to that of the anisotropies. In this case, solutions oscillate as they approach the singularity, just as in the vacuum case, and a similar behaviour is found when a non-minimal coupling is included. If the scalar field contribution is not subleading, then chaos is removed and the singularity is approached smoothly.An unusual and entirely new result appears when changing the sign in front of the scalar kinetic term, yielding the theory of a phantom scalar. If the scalar field is subleading, then solutions remain chaotic and oscillate when approaching the singularity, as before. However, if the scalar field is not subleading, solutions are also chaotic, but the spacetime singularity disappears, and the universe behaves as an apparently infinite sequence of anisotropic bounces. The spatial volume then oscillates within finite bounds, never reaching zero, while the amplitudes and positions of these oscillations appear completely random. To the best of our knowledge, this type of chaos has never been described.",
New submissions,Genesis--Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT data,"Han Gil Choi,Pavel Petrov,Seong Chan Park",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We propose a novel non-singular cosmological scenario within the framework of Horndeski gravity, consisting of three successive stages: (i) a Genesis phase, in which the Universe slowly expands from an asymptotically flat spacetime; (ii) a brief transition stage restoring General Relativity; and (iii) a Starobinsky inflationary phase. This construction is fully consistent within a viable parameter space: it remains weakly coupled, free from ghost and gradient instabilities, with luminal tensor and subluminal scalar perturbations throughout the entire evolution. Importantly, the Genesis phase induces characteristic corrections to the Starobinsky potential, which cannot be captured by simple $\sum_i c_i R^i$-type modifications. These corrections robustly enhance the scalar spectral index, thereby improving the agreement of Starobinsky inflation with recent CMB measurements, in particular the data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).",
New submissions,Effective LQG dynamics of a thin shell and the fate of a collapsing star,Francesco Fazzini,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Effective models inspired by loop quantum gravity typically resolve the central singularity by replacing it with a bounce of the matter density in the Planckian regime. In the specific model analyzed here, this bounce is generally followed by the formation of shell-crossing singularities. The purpose of this work is to provide a physically meaningful extension of spacetime beyond the shell-crossing singularity. To this end, we derive the dynamics of a dust thin shell within the effective Hamiltonian framework. The motion of the shell remains timelike throughout: after undergoing a quantum-gravitational bounce, it expands and eventually emerges from the white-hole vacuum region.",
New submissions,A dynamical systems perspective on the thermodynamics of late-time cosmology,"Dipayan Mukherjee,Harkirat Singh Sahota,Swati Gavas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A thermodynamic description of cosmological spacetimes may provide insights into the fundamentals of the cosmic evolution that remain otherwise obscure, in close analogy with 'black hole thermodynamics'. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of late-time cosmological evolution using the dynamical systems approach, focusing on the $\Lambda$CDM model and quintessence models with an exponential potential. Thermodynamic quantities obtained through the Hayward-Kodama formalism are mapped onto the phase space of these models, allowing us to investigate thermodynamic stability and phase transitions in a manner independent of the initial condition of the evolution of the universe. In both models, the universe inevitably undergoes a thermodynamic phase transition, marked by diverging specific heats, irrespective of its initial configuration. We further demonstrate that the thermodynamic stability can occur only during an accelerating phase of the universe. However, the necessary stability conditions are never satisfied anywhere in the phase space, rendering both models inherently thermodynamically unstable within the Hayward-Kodama framework. Importantly, our analysis highlights the dynamical system approach as a natural and powerful framework to probe the thermodynamic aspects of cosmological evolution.",
New submissions,Big-Bounce in Quantum f(R)-Cosmology: Polymer Dynamics with Internal Time,"M. L. Limongi,S. Lo Franco,G. Montani,S. Segreto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We construct the Hamiltonian formulation of the isotropic Universe in a generic metric f(R)-theory in the Jordan frame. We canonically quantize the Universe volume via a polymer formulation, and we adopt the scalar field naturally arising from this scenario as a physical clock. Being within the limit of cut-off values of the space volume, we are legitimized to neglect, at first approximation level, the self-interacting potential term associated with the scalar field. We first study the semi-classical polymer dynamics, outlining the emergence of a bouncing cosmology, both in the internal as well as in the synchronous time. In this latter time variable, we are also able to compare the obtained picture with that of a standard polymer Big-Bounce. We see that in the studied case, the collapsing and expanding branches are no longer symmetric with respect to the minimum volume configuration. Then, we fully quantize the system dynamics in the momentum representation, constructing a suitable dynamical Hilbert space and setting up the dynamics of localized wave packets. The mean value dynamics, both for the momentum and volume spaces, is characterized by a bouncing dynamics as described via the internal time, which closely resembles that one obtained in Loop Quantum Cosmology and Polymerization, respectively.",
New submissions,Unique gravitational wave signatures of GLPV scalar-tensor theories,"Guillem Domènech,Alexander Ganz,Mohammad Ali Gorji,Masahide Yamaguchi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study gravitational waves induced by scalar primordial fluctuations in Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV), beyond Horndeski, scalar-tensor theories. We uncover, at the level of the action, a new scalar-scalar-tensor interaction, unique to GLPV models disconnected from Horndeski via disformal transformation. The new interaction leads to third derivatives in the source for scalar-induced tensor modes, which are absent in Horndeski-related theories. Such new higher-derivative terms lead to a further enhanced production of induced gravitational waves. We predict that for a scale-invariant primordial spectrum, the induced gravitational wave spectral density has a characteristic frequency dependence proportional to $f^5$. Such a fast-rising spectrum offers a potential unique signature of modified gravity in the early universe.",
New submissions,Overcharging Extremal Rotating Black Holes,"Shauvik Biswas,Amruta Sadhu,Sudipta Sarkar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we use the weak cosmic censorship conjecture(WCC) to constrain black hole solutions in modified gravity theories. While Wald showed that extremal Kerr-Newman black holes in general relativity cannot be overcharged by test charged particles, this protection may fail in theories beyond general relativity. We have considered generic rotating black hole solutions beyond the Kerr-Newman family and examine particle absorption processes that could lead to overcharging and the emergence of naked singularities. Identifying regions of parameter space where WCC is violated allows us to place direct, physically motivated bounds on deviations from general relativity.",
New submissions,Gaussian curvature and Lyapunov exponent as probes of black hole phase transitions,"Shi-Hao Zhang,Zi-Qiang Zhao,Zi-Yuan Li,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the Gaussian curvature of unstable null orbits. The Gaussian curvature exhibits multivaluedness near the phase transition point of a first-order phase transition. Numerical investigations of Reissner-Nordstrom Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS), Hayward-AdS, and Hayward-Letelier-AdS black holes demonstrate that this geometric multivalued region coincides precisely with the spinodal region calculated by black hole thermodynamics. Using the known relation $K=-\lambda^2$ linking orbital geometry to chaotic dynamics, we show that this geometric feature also satisfies the critical exponents predicted by mean-field theory, consistent with those derived from Lyapunov exponents. Our work demonstrates that Gaussian curvature can serve as an alternative effective tool to study the phase structure of black holes.",
New submissions,Near-horizon Instabilities and Anomalous Decay Rate of Quasinormal Modes in Weyl Black Holes,"Gerasimos Kouniatalis,P. A. González,Eleftherios Papantonopoulos,Yerko Vásquez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the stability of the Weyl geometry considering an exact black hole solution. By calculating the geodesics of massless and massive scalar fields orbiting outside the Weyl black hole background and using the Lyapunov exponent, we show that chaotic instabilities appear in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Calculating the photon sphere's quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field perturbing the Weyl black hole, we find a relation connecting the QNMs with the Lyapunov exponent in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Furthermore, we study the anomalous decay rate of the QNMs connecting their behavior with the Lyapunov exponent.",
New submissions,Phase transitions of boson stars in scalar-tensor theories,"Hyat Huang,Burkhard Kleihaus,Jutta Kunz,Meng-Yun Lai,Eugen Radu,De-Cheng Zou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In scalar-tensor theories, compact objects may experience spontaneous scalarization. Recently, it was shown that matter-induced spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars is predominantly associated with a first-order phase transition. Here we consider matter-induced spontaneous scalarization of boson stars. Employing a repulsive quartic potential for the bosonic matter, we find only first-order phase transitions.",
New submissions,Marginal IR running of Gravity as a Natural Explanation for Dark Matter,Naman Kumar,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We propose that the infrared (IR) running of Newton's coupling provides a simple and universal explanation for large--distance modifications of gravity relevant to dark matter phenomenology. Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we model $G(k)$ as a scale--dependent coupling governed by an anomalous dimension $\eta$. We show that the marginal case $\eta = 1$ is singled out by renormalization group (RG) and dimensional arguments, leading to a logarithmic potential and a $1/r$ force law at large distances, while smoothly recovering Newtonian gravity at short scales. The logarithmic correction is universal and regulator independent, indicating that the $1/r$ force arises as the robust IR imprint of quantum--field--theoretic scaling. This provides a principled alternative to particle dark matter, suggesting that galactic rotation curves and related anomalies may be understood as manifestations of the IR running of Newton's constant.",
New submissions,First ICCUB Numerical Relativity Waveform Catalog of Eccentric Black Hole Binaries,"J. Trenado,T. Andrade,A. Climent,M. A. Ferrer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We release the first Numerical Relativity catalog of Institut de Ciencies del Cosmos at University of Barcelona (ICCUB) consisting of 128 simulations for black hole binaries. All simulations in this first release correspond to highly eccentric binaries with eccentricity $e = (0.62,0.79)$ which develop zoom-whirls up to three close passages before merger. We consider aligned, equal spin configurations in the range $\chi = (-0.5, 0.5)$ and equal mass ratios.For each simulation, we provide the modes $(\ell, m)$ of Weyl scalar $\psi_4^{(\ell,m)}$ extrapolated to $r = \infty$, with $\ell \leq 4$. In addition, we provide the corresponding strain modes obtained by computing a double time integral of the Weyl scalar modes. Moreover, we provide metadata and the parameter files required to reproduce our results using the open-source code Einstein Toolkit.A Python code that facilitates the access to the data is available on Git-Hub.",
New submissions,Robustness of Sensitivity Evaluations for Gravitational Wave Detection Algorithms,"Alexandra E. Koloniari,Lazaros Lazaridis,Christos Paschalidis,Nikolaos Stergioulas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries has transformed modern astrophysics, driving innovation in detection methodologies. Whereas matched-filtering techniques have long been the standard, the growing volume of data from advanced observatories like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has spurred interest in machine learning (ML) solutions for their scalability and computational efficiency. As next-generation detectors approach reality, the development of reliable and adaptable search algorithms becomes increasingly urgent. This work examines the consistency of detection sensitivity in AresGW model 1, an ML-based pipeline, when applied to multiple month-long datasets consisting of real detector noise. By analyzing the number of waveform injections detected and the sensitive distance at different FAR thresholds, we evaluate the model's performance under low false alarm rates and investigate how sensitivity metrics fluctuate due to dataset variability. In addition, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on data both with and without contamination of genuine GW signals. Our findings reveal notable performance variations, highlighting the challenges introduced by finite-duration datasets and emphasizing the need for more rigorous statistical validation. By identifying these challenges, we aim to clarify the practical limitations of both ML-based and traditional detection systems and inform future benchmarking standards for GW searches.",
Cross submissions,Averaged dynamics of ultra-relativisitc charged particles beams,Ricardo Gallego Torromé,Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph),"In this thesis, we consider the suitability of using the charged cold fluid model in the description of ultra-relativistic beams. The method that we have used is the following. Firstly, the necessary notions of kinetic theory and differential geometry of second order differential equations are explained. Then an averaging procedure is applied to a connection associated with the Lorentz force equation. The result of this averaging is an affine connection on the space-time manifold. The corresponding geodesic equation defines the averaged Lorentz force equation. We prove that for ultra-relativistic beams described by narrow distribution functions, the solutions of both equations are similar. This fact justifies the replacement of the Lorentz force equation by the simpler {\it averaged Lorentz force equation}. After this, for each of these models we associate the corresponding kinetic model, which are based on the Vlasov equation and {\it averaged Vlasov equation} respectively. The averaged Vlasov equation is simpler than the original Vlasov equation. This fact allows us to prove that the differential operation defining the averaged charged cold fluid equation is controlled by the {\it diameter of the distribution function}, by powers of the {\it energy of the beam} and by the time of evolution $t$. We show that the Vlasov equation and the averaged Vlasov equation have similar solutions, when the initial conditions are the same. Finally, as an application of the {\it averaged Lorentz force equation} we re-derive the beam dynamics formalism used in accelerator physics from the Jacobi equation of the averaged Lorentz force equation.",
Cross submissions,Equivalence Theorems and Double-Copy Structure in Scattering Amplitudes of Massive Kaluza-Klein States with Matter Interactions,"Kezhu Guo,Yanfeng Hang",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate the scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in compactified five-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. Focusing on tree-level $2\to2$ processes, we analyze the leading-order amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields and KK gauge/gravitational Goldstone bosons. By imposing the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) within warped KK theories, we systematically reconstruct the leading-order amplitudes for physical KK gauge bosons and gravitons, thereby circumventing the intricate energy cancellations inherent in physical amplitudes. Within this framework, the correspondence between GAET and GRET arises as a direct manifestation of the leading-order double-copy relation in the high-energy expansion. This connection provides a foundation for extending the BCJ double-copy construction to four-point amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields, and further generalizes to arbitrary $N$-point cases, enabling a systematic derivation of the corresponding gravitational amplitudes with consistent incorporation of KK matter fields at leading order.",
Cross submissions,Characteristic tensors for almost Finsler manifolds,"James F. Davis,Benjamin R. Edwards,Alan Kostelecky",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Almost Finsler manifolds and partial Finsler manifolds are introduced, extending the standard definition of a Finsler manifold to allow for a nontrivial slit containing points fixed under homogeneous scaling and for metrics where the fundamental tensor has nonpositive eigenvalues. The bipartite spaces offer examples of comparatively simple almost Finsler manifolds and partial Finsler manifolds with physics applications. Special cases are the $\bf{a}$ and $\bf{b}$ spaces, which have almost Finsler norms and partial Finsler norms formed from a Riemannian norm and a 1-form. The indicatrix union of the almost Finsler $\bf{a}$ manifolds equals the indicatrix union of Randers spaces. Characteristic tensors that vanish for bipartite spaces and $\bf{b}$ spaces are obtained and expressed using geometric quantities. These tensors are generalizations of the Matsumoto tensor, which vanishes on Randers and $\bf{a}$ spaces.",
Cross submissions,A measure on the space of CFTs and pure 3D gravity,"Alexandre Belin,Alexander Maloney,Florian Seefeld",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We define a normalizable measure on the space of two-dimensional conformal field theories, which we interpret as a maximum ignorance ensemble. We test whether pure quantum gravity in AdS$_3$ is dual to the average over this ensemble. We find a negative answer, which implies that CFTs with a primary gap of order the central charge are highly atypical in our ensemble. We provide evidence that more generally, holographic CFTs are atypical in the space of all CFTs by finding similar results for permutation orbifolds: subgroups of $S_N$ with a good large $N$ limit are very sparse in the space of all subgroups. Along the way, we derive several new results on the space of CFTs. Notably we derive an upper bound on the spacing in central charge between CFTs, which is doubly exponentially small in the large central charge limit.",
Cross submissions,"Can ""premature collapse"" form black holes in the upper and lower mass gaps?","Thomas W. Baumgarte,Stuart L. Shapiro",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, including the recent signals GW231123 and GW230529, have revealed multiple progenitor black holes in the so-called upper and lower mass gaps, respectively. It is generally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass gap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt the stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum allowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in supernova explosions. Here we explore a ""premature collapse"" scenario in which upper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late stage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse is the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A similar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass gap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely result in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining the rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on several parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least in galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the upper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the lower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.",
Cross submissions,Integral formulas for under/overdetermined differential operators via recovery on curves and the finite-dimensional cokernel condition I: General theory,"Philip Isett,Yuchen Mao,Sung-Jin Oh,Zhongkai Tao",Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"We introduce a new versatile method for constructing solution operators (i.e., right-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for a wide class of underdetermined PDEs $P u = f$, which are regularizing of optimal order and, more interestingly, whose integral kernels have certain prescribed support properties. By duality, we simultaneously obtain integral representation formulas (i.e., left-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for overdetermined PDEs $P^{\ast} v = g$ with analogous properties, which lead to Poincaré- or Korn-type inequalities. Our method applies to operators such as the divergence, linearized scalar curvature, and linearized Einstein constraint operators (which are underdetermined), as well as the gradient, Hessian, trace-free part of the Hessian, Killing, and conformal Killing operators (which are overdetermined).The starting point for our construction is a condition - dubbed the recovery on curves condition (RC) - that leads to Green's functions for $P$ supported on prescribed curves. Then the desired integral solution operators (and, by duality, integral representation formulas) are obtained by taking smooth averages over a suitable family of curves. This procedure generalizes the previous constructions of Bogovskii, Oh-Tataru, and Reshetnyak. We furthermore identify a simple algebraic sufficient condition for (RC), namely, that the principal symbol $p(x, \xi)$ of $P$ is full-rank for all non-zero complex vectors $\xi$ (as opposed to real, as in ellipticity). When the principal symbol has constant coefficients, this is equivalent to (RC) and also to the condition that the formal cokernel of $P$ (without any boundary conditions) is finite-dimensional; for this reason, we call it the finite-dimensional cokernel condition (FC). We give a short proof that all operators above satisfy (FC), and thus (RC).Various applications will be considered in subsequent papers.",
Cross submissions,Semi-classical spacetime thermodynamics,"Ana Alonso-Serrano,Marek Liška,Michał Piotrak",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We derive the semi-classical gravitational dynamics from thermodynamics of local stretched light cones in 2-dimensional dilaton gravity, explicitly treating the backreaction of quantum matter through the conformal anomaly's effect on the generalized entropy. We also sketch the extension of this analysis to the conformal anomaly in 4-dimensional semi-classical gravity. In direct connection to this problem, we also tackle the appropriate definition of Wald entropy in thermodynamic derivation of equations of motion for classical scalar-tensor theories. For the class of Brans-Dicke theories, including 2-dimensional dilaton gravity, we show that the equations of motion follow from the dynamical Wald entropy associated with local causal horizons.",
Cross submissions,Stochastic inflation with gradient interactions,"Vadim Briaud,Ryodai Kawaguchi,Vincent Vennin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Stochastic inflation rests on the separate-universe approximation, i.e. the ability to describe long-wavelength fluctuations in an inflating universe as homogeneous perturbations of its background dynamics. Although this approximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it breaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor phases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to enhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial black holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in such models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of backreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how gradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of Langevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases of interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the classical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from cosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered. We uncover the existence of a ""pullback"" effect by which the tails of the first-passage-time distributions are dampened by gradient interactions. We finally discuss the role of backreaction in the presence of gradient interactions.",
Cross submissions,Bulk viscosity from early-time thermalization of cosmic fluids in light of DESI DR2 data,"Hermano Velten,William Iania",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"If nonrelativistic dark matter and radiation are allowed to interact, reaching an approximate thermal equilibrium, this interaction induces a bulk viscous pressure changing the effective one-fluid description of the universe dynamics. By modeling such components as perfect fluids, a cosmologically relevant bulk viscous pressure emerges for dark matter particle masses in the range of $1\,\text{eV} - 10\,\text{eV}$ keeping thermal equilibrium with the radiation. Such a transient bulk viscosity introduces significant effects in the expansion rate near the matter-radiation equality (redshift $z_{\text{eq}} \sim 3400$) and at late times (leading to a higher inferred value of the Hubble constant $H_0$). We use the recent DESI DR2 BAO data to place an upper bound on the free parameter of the model $\tau_\text{eq}$ which represents the time scale in which each component follows its own internal perfect fluid dynamics until thermalization occurs. Our main result is encoded in the bound $\tau_\text{eq} < 1.84 \times 10^{-10} $ s (2$\sigma$), with the corresponding dimensionless bulk coefficient $\tilde{\xi} H_0/H_{eq}<5.94\times10^{-4}$ (2$\sigma$). In practice, this rules out any possible interaction between radiation and dark matter prior to the recombination epoch.",
Cross submissions,Positive Energy Theorems for Spin Initial Data with Charge,Simon Raulot,Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We establish positive energy theorems for complete spin initial data sets with charge in dimensions $n \geq 4$, under a dominant energy condition and assuming the existence of at least one asymptotically flat end.
