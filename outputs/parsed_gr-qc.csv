New submissions,Bayesian Calibration of Gravitational-Wave Detectors Using Null Streams Without Waveform Assumptions,"Isaac C. F. Wong,Francesco Cireddu,Milan Wils,Tom Colemont,Harsh Narola,Chris Van Den Broeck,Tjonnie G. F. Li",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We introduce a Bayesian null-stream method to constrain calibration errors in closed-geometry gravitational-wave (GW) detector networks. Unlike prior methods requiring electromagnetic counterparts or waveform models, this method uses sky-independent null streams to calibrate the detectors with any GW signals, independent of general relativity or waveform assumptions. We show a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. We discuss prospects for next-generation detectors like Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LISA, where enhanced calibration accuracy will advance low-frequency GW science.",
New submissions,A Parametrized Test of General Relativity for LISA Massive Black Hole Binary Inspirals,"Manuel Piarulli,Sylvain Marsat,Elise M. Sänger,Alessandra Buonanno,Jan Steinhoff,Nicola Tamanini",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) will provide long duration inspiral signals with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data, ideal for testing general relativity (GR) in the strong-field and high-velocity regime. We present an extension of the Flexible Theory-Independent (FTI) framework, adapted to gravitational waves (GWs) from MBHBs observed with LISA, to perform parametrized inspiral tests of GR. This approach introduces generic deviations to the post-Newtonian (PN) coefficients of the frequency-domain GW phase while accounting for the time- and frequency-dependent instrument response, thus effectively identifying potential deviations from GR by constraining modifications to the PN phasing formula. Complementary analyses using Fisher matrix and full Bayesian approaches confirm that LISA observations could improve constraints on deviations from GR by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the most recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA measurements. Since LISA`s sensitivity to different GW phases -- inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- varies across the MBHB parameter space with masses between $10^4$ and $10^7M_{\odot}$, the optimal regime for testing deviations is not known a priori. Our results illustrate how the strength of these constraints depends significantly on both the total mass and the SNR, reflecting the trade-off between inspiral and merger-ringdown contributions to the observed signal. We also investigate the interplay between inspiral-only versus inspiral-merger-ringdown analyses in constraining these inspiral deviation parameters. This work contributes to the development of robust tests of GR with LISA, enhancing our ability to probe the nature of gravity and BHs with GW observations.",
New submissions,"On planetary orbits, ungravity and entropic gravity","G. Pérez Cuéllar,M. Sabido",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In previous works, entropic gravity and ungravity have been considered as possible solutions to the dark energy and dark matter problems. To test the viability of these models, modifications to planetary orbits are calculated for ungravity and different models of entropic gravity. Using the gravitational sector of unparticles, an equation for the contribution to the effect of orbital precession is obtained. We conclude that the estimated values for the ungravity parameters from planetary orbits are inconsistent with the values needed for the cosmological constant. The same ideas are explored for entropic gravity arising from a modified entropy--area relationship.",
New submissions,A comprehensive look into the accuracy of SpEC binary black hole waveforms,"Taylor Knapp,Katerina Chatziioannou,Keefe Mitman,Mark A. Scheel,Michael Boyle,Lawrence E. Kidder,Harald Pfeiffer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Numerical relativity simulations provide a full description of the dynamics of binary systems, including gravitational radiation. The waveforms produced by these simulations have a number of applications in gravitational-wave detection and inference. In this work, we revisit the accuracy of the waveforms produced by the Spectral Einstein Code. Motivated by the wide range of waveform applications, we propose and explore three accuracy metrics between simulation resolutions: (i) the generalized frequency-weighted mismatch, (ii) the relative amplitude difference, and (iii) the phase difference at different times. We find that numerical errors accumulate over the binary evolution, but the error is not intrinsically larger during the latest, more dynamical stages. Studying errors across the parameter space, we identify a positive correlation between both the mismatch and the phase difference with precessing spin, but little correlation with aligned spin or eccentricity. Lastly, amplitude and phases differences are symmetric upon exchanging resolutions across the catalog, suggesting that there is no systematic error.",
New submissions,The impact of missing data on the construction of LISA Time Delay Interferometry Michelson variables,"Ollie Burke,Martina Muratore,Graham Woan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the impact of missing input data on the construction of second-generation Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) variables, which enable data analysis for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). TDI relies on the introduction of precise time delays into the raw interferometric data streams before they are combined to suppress otherwise dominant laser phase noise. We show that a single missing sample, corresponding to 0.25 s of data, will result in an effective data gap of approximately 90 s in the second-generation TDI output if further measures are not taken. This additional gap is largely independent of the initial gap duration, but increases linearly with the order of the fractional-delay filter used for the computations. For a realistic gap scenario, incorporating both planned and unplanned data interruptions consistent with a target duty cycle of ~84%, we find that frequent, short-duration gaps (e.g., a total of 1000 per year, each of which have short durations ~ 100 s) could result in an additional loss in the TDI variables of about one day per year corresponding to a ~0.3% reduction in duty cycle. This amounts to a loss of approximately one day of LISA data suitable for the global-fit per year.",
New submissions,Singularities as Solitons? Quantum Vacuum Architecture of Black Holes,Eren Erberk Erkul,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose that black holes are \emph{soliton-esque} objects, where gravitational collapse is balanced by quantum vacuum dispersion, modeled via \(R+\alpha R^{2}\) gravity. Classical singularities are replaced by oscillating, finite-radius cores, thereby evading static no-go theorems. The event horizon is replaced by the \textit{Lamarina}, a surface of maximum redshift whose surface geometry yields Hawking-like radiation with corrections. The Raychaudhuri equations impose a Dyson-type ceiling on the maximum radiated power \((P_{\infty} \lesssim c^{5}/G)\), while effective field theory matching dictates a universal minimum Lamarina radius set by the dispersion scale.",
New submissions,New AF Einstein--Maxwell instantons,"Bernardo Araneda,Maciej Dunajski",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"We explicitly construct a three--parameter family of asymptotically flat Einstein--Maxwell instantons. These solutions are toric, regular, and free of conical and orbifold singularities on the manifold $M=\CP^2\setminus S^1$. They are counterexamples to the Euclidean Einstein--Maxwell Black Hole Uniqueness Conjecture. In the case of vanishing charge these instantons reduce to the Chen--Teo Ricci flat instantons.",
New submissions,Kerr-Schild transformation of the Benenti-Francaviglia metric,"Masato Nozawa,Takashi Torii",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"The Benenti-Francaviglia (BF) family of metrics provides the most general form of a spacetime metric that admits two mutually commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. The geodesic equations for the BF family are thus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class, we explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass distinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By requiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity, we demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF family, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the present algorithm to ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic generalization of the Chong-Cvetič-Lü-Pope rotating black hole solution, by taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar gravity. The present prescription extends to five dimensions, provided that the constant of geodesic motion associated with the extra Killing direction vanishes. The same reasoning applies to the case where the background degenerate BF metric is distorted in a (non)conformal manner. Our formalism offers a unified perspective on the relation between seed and deformed metrics in the Kerr-Schild construction.",
New submissions,Classical Polymerization of the Bianchi I Model with Deformed Poisson Structure,Babak Vakili,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the dynamics of the Bianchi~I cosmological model in the presence of both polymer quantization effects and an exponential deformation of the Poisson algebra. Starting from the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the polymer-deformed equations of motion and analyze their solutions for the contracting branch of the model. In contrast with the undeformed classical dynamics, the exponential deformation with suitable values of deformation parameters, produces a noticeably slower evolution of the volume variable and leads to a stabilization of the anisotropy parameters, which remain bounded throughout the evolution. No removal of the initial singularity is observed; however, the deformation significantly modifies the asymptotic behavior, offering a mechanism to suppress anisotropic shear near the singularity. Our results are illustrated through analytic solutions, highlighting the qualitative differences between the standard and the polymer--deformed Bianchi~I cosmology.",
New submissions,"Bonanno-Reuter regular black hole: quasi-resonances, grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections of a massive scalar field",Zainab Malik,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field in the background of the regular, quantum-corrected Bonanno-Reuter black hole, which arises from the renormalization group improvement of the Schwarzschild solution within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. The analysis is performed in both the time and frequency domains. We find that increasing the mass of the field leads to a strong suppression of the damping rate, and extrapolation to larger masses indicates the emergence of arbitrarily long-lived oscillations, or quasi-resonances. In the time domain, the late-time decay follows an asymptotic behavior that differs from the power-law tails of the classical Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we compute the grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections for the massive scalar field and show that the grey-body factors decrease as the field mass increases, effectively shifting the emitted radiation spectrum toward higher frequencies.",
New submissions,Seed models in scalar field cosmology,I. V. Fomin,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The correspondence of single-field cosmological models based on Einstein gravity to modern observational data is considered. A method is proposed to determine possible types of dynamics based on extreme values of the scalar field. It is shown that within the framework of this approach, it is possible to obtain a limited class of known inflationary models at early times. It is also shown that on large times the proposed approach leads to the $\Lambda$CDM--model in order to describe the dynamics of the second accelerated expansion of the universe. An interpretation of the considered models is presented as a starting point for constructing verifiable cosmological models based on modified gravity theories.",
New submissions,When vacuum breaks: a self-consistency test for astrophysical environments in extreme mass ratio inspirals,"Lorenzo Copparoni,Rohit S. Chandramouli,Enrico Barausse",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Gravitational-wave signals are typically interpreted under the vacuum hypothesis, i.e. assuming negligible influence from the astrophysical environment. This assumption is expected to break down for low-frequency sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which are prime targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and are expected to form, at least in part, in dense environments such as Active Galactic Nuclei or dark-matter spikes/cores. Modeling environmental effects parametrically is challenging due to the large uncertainties in their underlying physics. We propose a non-parametric test for environmental effects in EMRIs, based on assessing the self-consistency of vacuum parameter posteriors inferred from different portions of the signal. Our results demonstrate that this approach can reveal the presence of astrophysical environments, or even deviations from General Relativity, without introducing additional parameters or assumptions about the underlying physics.",
New submissions,Unified Dark Matter and Dark Energy in a model of Non-Canonical Scalar-Tensor Theory,"Nihal Jalal Pullisseri,Sanil Unnikrishnan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We consider a model of non-canonical scalar-tensor theory in which the kinetic term in the Brans-Dicke action is replaced by a non-canonical scalar field Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(X, \phi)= \lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta - V(\phi)$ where $X = (1/2) \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial^{\mu} \phi$ and $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\lambda$ are parameters of the model. This can be considered as a simple non-canonical generalization of the Brans-Dicke theory with a potential term which corresponds to a special case of this model with the values of the parameter $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = -1$ and $\lambda = 2w_{_{BD}}$ where $w_{_{BD}}$ is the Brans-Dicke parameter. Considering a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with scale factor $a(t)$, it is shown that, in the matter free Universe, the kinetic term $\lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta$ can lead to a power law solution $a(t)\propto t^{n}$ but the maximum possible value of $n$ turns out to be $(1+\sqrt{3})/4 \approx 0.683$. When $\alpha \geq 18$, this model can lead to a solution $a(t)\propto t^{2/3}$, thereby mimicking the evolution of scale factor in a cold dark matter dominated epoch with Einstein's General Relativity (GR). With the addition of a linear potential term $V(\phi) = V_{0}\phi$, it is shown that this model mimics the standard $\Lambda$CDM model type evolution of the Universe. The larger the value of $\alpha$, the closer the evolution of $a(t)$ in this model to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model based on Einstein's GR. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this model with a linear potential can mimic the GR based $\Lambda$CDM model. However, with an appropriate choice of the potential $V(\phi)$, this model can provide a unified description of both dark matter and dynamical dark energy, as if it were based on Einstein's GR.",
New submissions,Characterization of gravitational radiation at infinity with a cosmological constant,"Francisco Fernández-Álvarez,José M. M. Senovilla",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The existence or absence of gravitational radiation escaping from the spacetime at $\mathscr{J}$ is characterized in the presence of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ of any sign. To that end, the properties of the asymptotic super-momentum are used. When $\Lambda=0$, the characterization is equivalent to that based on the News tensor. For $\Lambda\neq 0$, it provides the first reliable definition of existence of radiation at $\mathscr{J}$, and it gives fully satisfactory results in known exact solutions.",
New submissions,GW231123: extreme spins or microglitches?,"Anarya Ray,Sharan Banagiri,Eric Thrane",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The recently reported binary black hole merger, GW231123, has unusual properties that make it hard to explain astrophysically. Parameter estimation studies are consistent with maximally spinning black holes and the dimensionless spin of the more massive component is constrained to be $\chi_1\gtrsim 0.8$. Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that could not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the possibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian noise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest. We present evidence for a population of \textit{microglitches} in LIGO gravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter estimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123. Using simulated data of a massive event like GW231123, we demonstrate how microglitches can bias our measurements of black hole spins toward $\chi\approx1$ with negligible posterior support for the true value of $\chi\approx0.7$. We develop a noise model to account for microglitches and show that this model successfully reduces biases in the recovery of signal parameters. We characterize the microglitch population in real interferometer data surrounding GW231123 and find a single detector glitch duty cycle of $0.57_{-0.19}^{+0.21}$, which implies nearly a $100\%$ probability that at least one event through the fourth gravitational wave transient catalog coincides with microglitches in two detectors. We argue that further investigations are required before we can have a confident picture of the astrophysical properties of GW231123.",
New submissions,Can One Model Gravitational Nonlinear Memory with Fractional Derivative Operators?,"Sercan Kaya,Bayram Tekin",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We investigate whether fractional calculus, with its intrinsic long-tailed memory and nonlocal features, can provide a viable model for gravitational-wave memory effects. We consider two toy constructions: ($i$) a fractional modification of the linearized Einstein field equations using a sequential Caputo operator, and ($ii$) a fractionalized quadrupole formula where the source moment is acted upon by the same operator. Both constructions yield history-dependent responses with small memory-like offsets. However, in all cases, the signal decays to zero at late times, failing to reproduce the permanent displacement predicted by GR. Our results, therefore, constitute a no-go demonstration: naive fractionalization is insufficient to model nonlinear gravitational memory. We argue that any successful model must incorporate fractional kernels directly into the hereditary flux-balance integral of General Relativity, while preserving gauge invariance and dimensional consistency. We also discuss possible connections to modified gravity and the absence of memory in the spacetime with dimensions $D>4$.",
New submissions,Gauge Dependence of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations: Analytical Results,"Arshad Ali,Yang Lei,Mudassar Sabir",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analytically study the gauge dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) sourced by primordial isocurvature perturbations during radiation domination (RD), working across nine gauges. Through analytical integrations of the kernels supported by graphical comparison we identify a clear dichotomy. We find that in some gauges viz. the uniform-density (UD), total-matter (TM), uniform-curvature (UC), comoving-orthogonal (CO) and transverse-traceless (TT) gauges the energy density grows polynomially in conformal time $\eta^n$, where $n$ varies from $2$ to $8$. While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal (Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges the late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For subhorizon modes ($ k\eta \gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that SIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a kernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational wave components (oscillating as $\sin(k\eta)$ and $\cos(k\eta)$), eliminating spurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\eta)^{-1} $ and yields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only luminal modes represent physical SIGWs.",
New submissions,Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinates for Kiselev black holes,"Bijan Bagchi,Sauvik Sen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the implications provided by the modified Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinates in the context of quintessence for the Kiselev black hole. In this regard, we set up a fully static line element in terms of lapse and shift functions, apart from including the deformation parameter signaling deviation from the standard Painlevé-Gullstrand metric. We address two specific issues pertaining to the problems of radiation and dust furnished by the corresponding barotropic index parameter and study the related consequences by performing a range of analyses to explore the influence imposed by quintessence. We also discuss the thermodynamical consequences by evaluating the expressions of the Hawking temperature and the entropy function in closed forms.",
New submissions,Modified Fronsdal coordinates for maximally extended Schwarzschild spacetime,Andrei Galiautdinov,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We introduce a coordinate system that complements the Kruskal--Szekeres extension. Like the standard construction, it covers the maximally extended Schwarzschild manifold in its entirety, while offering an additional advantage of expressing the areal radius as an explicit function of the new coordinates. Its main limitation, however, is that radial null geodesics are no longer represented as 45-degree lines in the Kruskal plane, making the causal structure more difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, the new system offers a compelling aesthetic trade-off: among all known maximally extended systems - including those of Kruskal-Szekeres, Israel, Fronsdal, Novikov, and Synge - it exhibits the highest degree of symmetry with respect to Schwarzschild's original r- and t-coordinate lines. It trades the regular pattern of Kruskal's light cones for a symmetric nesting arrangement of the two-dimensional spheres. The proposed extension sheds new light on the closely related Fronsdal's six-dimensional embedding construction, and clarifies the deep connection that exists between the most important implicit (Kruskal-Szekeres) and explicit (Israel's) procedures for maximal extension of the Schwarzschild geometry that is well known to those working in the field but rarely presented in textbooks on general relativity.",
Cross submissions,Rolling with modular symmetry: quintessence and de Sitter in heterotic orbifolds,"Hansel Gordillo-Ruiz,Miguel Hernandez-Segura,Ignacio Portillo-Castillo,Saul Ramos-Sanchez,Ivonne Zavala",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Modular invariance is a fundamental symmetry in string compactifications, constraining both the structure of the effective theory and the dynamics of moduli and matter fields. It has also gained renewed importance in the context of swampland conjectures and, independently, flavour physics. We investigate a modular-invariant scalar potential arising from heterotic orbifolds, where the flavour structure and moduli dynamics are jointly shaped by the underlying geometry. Focusing on a string-inspired, two-moduli truncation, we uncover a rich vacuum structure featuring anti-de Sitter minima and unstable de Sitter saddle points. We identify large regions in moduli space supporting multifield hilltop quintessence consistent with observations. All solutions satisfy refined swampland de Sitter bounds. Our results illustrate how modular symmetry can guide the construction of controlled, string-motivated quintessence scenarios within consistent effective theories.",
Cross submissions,Vision Transformer for Transient Noise Classification,"Divyansh Srivastava,Andrzej Niedzielski",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by effectively distinguishing transient noise.Key words: gravitational waves --vision transformer --machine learning",
Cross submissions,Detecting Black Hole Microstates,"Vijay Balasubramanian,William KL Chan,Chitraang Murdia",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We demonstrate that the Euclidean two-point function of an appropriately chosen probe operator can detect the microstate of an asymptotically AdS black hole. This detection, which requires a tuned, state-dependent choice of probe, is the result of a new gravitational saddle, which dominates over the usual saddles. The gravitational result can be explicitly reproduced in the dual boundary CFT if we assume the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We also discuss a binary search protocol to detect the black hole microstate from a candidate list.",
Cross submissions,Dynamics of Cosmic Superstrings and the Overshoot Problem,"Luca Brunelli,Michele Cicoli,Francisco Gil Pedro",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We exploit the techniques of dynamical systems to study the cosmological evolution of cosmic fundamental strings and effective strings arising from branes wrapped on internal cycles. We also include the whole potential of the volume modulus characterised by an early time run-away towards a late time minimum. We analyse the overshoot problem with and without radiation, and find that the presence of an initial population of strings arising from NS5-branes wrapped around 4-cycles is enough to ensure that the modulus stabilises in its late time minimum, even in the absence of radiation. The reason is the transfer of energy between the modulus and the effective strings caused by the fact that their tension depends on the volume modulus. Interestingly, we find that the energy density of cosmic superstrings is generically very large when the modulus is oscillating around its minimum, opening up the possibility of a detectable gravitational wave signal. We also find no evidence of an efficient resonant enhancement of cosmic superstrings due to an oscillating tension in the late time minimum.",
Cross submissions,Classification of $g$-modes for neutron stars with a strong transition: Novel universal relation including slow stable twin stars,"M. C. Rodriguez,José C. Jiménez,Ignacio F. Ranea-Sandoval",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"We investigate the behavior of the non-radial gravity-pulsation discontinuity mode ($g$-mode) in hybrid compact stars with a strong first-order phase transition, which can give rise to twin-star configurations in some cases. These modes are of utmost relevance since they can be potentially excited in isolated as well as binary neutron star systems in the inspiral phase, thus allowing us to indirectly detect the presence of a deconfinement transition. In order to do this, we consider four categories of twin stars that present distinctive features in their equations of state. We employ the constant speed of sound parametrization, which accounts for a sharp phase transition between confined hadronic matter and deconfined quark matter. Then, working within the relativistic Cowling approximation to obtain the frequencies of non-radial oscillations, we find that, depending on the twin star category, the relations between $g$-mode frequencies and masses as well as tidal deformabilities display a highly distinct behavior across the diverse twin star categories that appear in the slow hadron-quark conversion regime. This distinct phenomenology provides smoking-gun evidence to clearly distinguish and further classify hybrid stars with a strong transition from purely hadronic stars using upcoming gravitational-wave data. In addition, we present for each of the categories studied the relation between the $g$-mode frequency and the normalized energy density jump. Finally, we present a novel universal relationship for the discontinuity $g$-mode able to encompass the four categories including long branches of slow stable twin stars and address its asteroseismological capability.",
Cross submissions,Boundary Conditions of Warped AdS$_3$ in New Massive Gravity,"S. N. Sajadi,Supakchai Ponglertsakul",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"To satisfy the Cardy formula for Warped AdS$_3$ (WAdS$_{3}$) solutions in a quadratic ensemble, a specific set of boundary conditions has been proposed in \cite{Aggarwal:2020igb}. In this paper, these boundary conditions have been investigated in the three-dimensional new massive gravity (NMG) framework. The associated solution space, asymptotic symmetries, and charge algebra have been extracted. It has been shown that the surface charges are finite, but not integrable, and the integrability of the charges is obtained after restricting to a sub-sector of the original solution space. Finally, we have proved that the Cardy formula reproduces the thermodynamic entropy of a warped BTZ black hole.",
Cross submissions,Hyperinvariant Spin Network States -- An AdS/CFT Model from First Principles,"Fynn Otto,Refik Mansuroglu,Norbert Schuch,Otfried Gühne,Hanno Sahlmann",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the existence and limitations for hyperinvariant tensor networks incorporating a local SU(2) symmetry. As discrete implementations of the anti de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, such networks have created bridges between the fields of quantum information theory and quantum gravity. Adding SU(2) symmetry to the tensor network allows a direct connection to spin network states, a basis of the kinematic Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a particular situation where the states can be interpreted as kinematic quantum states for three-dimensional quantum gravity. We show that important aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are realized in certain quantum states of the gravitational field in LQG, thus justifying, from first principles, a class of models introduced by [F. Pastawski et al., JHEP 06, 149 (2015)]. We provide examples of hyperinvariant tensor networks, but also prove constraints on their existence in the form of no-go theorems that exclude absolutely maximally entangled states as well as general holographic codes from local SU(2)-invariance. We calculate surface areas as expectation values of the LQG area operator and discuss further possible constraints as a consequence of a decay of correlations on the boundary.",
Cross submissions,Scalar Quasinormal modes in Reissner--Nordström black holes: implications for Weak Gravity Conjecture,"Giorgio Di Russo,Anna Tokareva",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Microscopic charged black holes can provide possibilities to test the consistency of the effective field theory (EFT) corrections to Einstein-Maxwell theory. A particularly interesting result is fixing the sign of a certain combination of EFT couplings from the requirement that all charged black holes should be able to evaporate (Weak Gravity Conjecture). In our work, we analysed the EFT corrections to a set of zero-damping quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the scalar wave probe in a nearly extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole. We review the duality of this setup to the problem of the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve of $N=2$ Super-Yang-Mills theory with three flavors. We provide an analytic result for the EFT corrections to the QNMs obtained from the quantization condition imposed on the Seiberg-Witten cycle. Our main result is that the causality requirement of the gravitational theory formulated for the QNMs translates to the same condition on EFT couplings as the one appearing in the Weak Gravity Conjecture.",
Cross submissions,Thermodynamic Remnants in Black-hole Evaporation,"Ivan Arraut,Abhishek Kumar Mehta",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),We show that black-hole remnant scenario naturally arises in the original computations of Hawking without extra assumptions.,
