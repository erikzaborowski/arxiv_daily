New submissions,A new model of spontaneous scalarization of black holes induced by curvature and matter,"Zakaria Belkhadria,Salvatore Mignemi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a new model of black hole spontaneous scalarization that combines a scalar--Gauss--Bonnet interaction with a non-minimal coupling to a $U(1)$ gauge field (a dark photon or an electromagnetic field). This construction generalizes earlier single-coupling setups and allows both curvature-induced and matter-induced scalarization within one framework, which allows us to overcome the limitations of each mechanism alone. We focus on charged, spherically symmetric black holes and demonstrate that our model substantially expands the range of black hole masses and charges that permit scalar hair. Negative Gauss--Bonnet couplings, previously associated only with near-extremal charges or rapidly spinning black holes, now trigger scalarization for much broader charge intervals. We develop a numerical procedure to solve the field equations, and investigate the various properties of these black holes. This results in new branches emerging at distinct mass thresholds, a behavior not seen in the pure Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet or Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet--Ricci models. The scalar charge depends sensitively on the coupling parameters and on the $U(1)$ charge. Our analysis also shows that these black holes have larger entropy than their Reissner--Nordström counterparts and can become overcharged, surpassing the usual extremal limit of charge-to-mass ratio. Analyzing the scalar charge behavior suggests that adding matter-coupling appears to stabilize solutions that were previously prone to higher-order instabilities in pure Gauss--Bonnet models with quadratic coupling and broadens the range of possible configurations, making this model a promising candidate for further studies in strong gravity.",
New submissions,Cosmographical analysis of sign-switching dark energy,"Mariam Bouhmadi-López,Beñat Ibarra-Uriondo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inspired by the well-studied $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, we propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models that evolve from a negative cosmological constant, transitioning to a positive value at low redshifts. Specifically, we introduce a dark energy framework based on a generalised ladder-step function for the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we present two additional models in which the cosmological constant undergoes a smooth sign change at a specified redshift. We provide a detailed discussion of the construction and theoretical properties of these models, analysing their background cosmological evolution using a cosmographic approach and the statefinder hierarchy parameters. Our results are compared with those obtained for the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM models. We also perform a careful analysis of the types of singularities that may arise in these models due to a sign change in the cosmological constant. Notably, we show that a continuous sign change removes the sudden singularity present in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, replacing it with a milder $w$-singularity.",
New submissions,A mock data challenge for next-generation detectors,"Regimbau Tania,Suresh Jishnu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The Einstein Telescope (ET), a planned third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatory, will offer significantly improved sensitivity, introducing new challenges for data analysis and computing. To prepare for these demands, the ET community has initiated a series of Mock Data Challenges (MDCs) aimed at developing and testing analysis pipelines under realistic conditions. This paper presents the first ET MDC, providing an overview of the simulated dataset and the properties of the injected GW signals, with a focus on populations of compact binary coalescences and Gaussian noise. A tutorial is also included to guide users in accessing the data and performing basic analyses. This initial challenge establishes a baseline for future MDCs and supports collaborative efforts toward the successful scientific operation of the ET.",
New submissions,Discrimination of metric theories,"F. J. Lobo,M. Rivera-Tapia,G. Rubilar,O. Jiménez,A. Delgado",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We study the possibility of discriminating between metric theories within the Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism. In this approach, the two-dimensional quantum state of a massive quantum clock becomes, after propagating at low speed and in a weak gravitational field, a function of the post-Newtonian parameters and thus a signature of a metric theory. To discriminate among metric theories, we resort to quantum-state discrimination strategies such as minimum error and unambiguous state discrimination. In particular, we show that it is possible to refute the hypothesis that a particular metric theory describes spacetime with a single detection event and that it is possible to discriminate with certainty between two different metrics, also with a single detection event. In general, the success probability of the discrimination strategy is a harmonic function of the product of the difference of the proper time corresponding to each quantum clock state, the energy difference between the energy eigenstates of the quantum clock, the propagation length, and speed. It is thus possible to find suitable length and speed scales such that the success probability is close to one by selecting a quantum system with the highest energy difference and the largest natural lifetime. According to this, atomic nuclei such as thorium are considered the most suitable quantum clocks.",
New submissions,Reheating and relic gravitational waves as remedies for degeneracies of non-canonical natural inflation,"Karam Bahari,Soma Heydari,Kayoomars Karami",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Here, a natural non-canonical inflationary model based on a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We analyze the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of the model and identify their degeneracies with respect to the free parameters. Notably, $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ are independent of the model parameters that leads to unresolved degeneracies. Employing the constraints on reheating parameters such as the reheating duration $N_{\rm{reh}}$, the reheating temperature $T_{\rm{reh}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{reh}}$, is found to be insufficient to fully break these degeneracies. However, the relic gravitational wave spectrum provides a way to break degeneracy with respect to the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$, degeneracy with respect to the potential parameter $f$ persist. Finally, we specify the allowed ranges for the inflationary duration $N$ and the parameter $\alpha$, in light of the latest observational data. These results highlight the role of relic gravitational waves in refining inflationary models and illustrate the challenges in fully resolving parameter degeneracies.",
New submissions,A covariant scalar-field framework for singularity resolution and dark energy,Martin Drobczyk,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a covariant scalar-field framework that unifies the space-time singularity resolution with dynamic dark energy. The theory extends general relativity by introducing a scalar field $\Phi$ whose potential couples to the Lorentz-invariant quantity $X \equiv u_{\alpha} u_{\beta} T^{\alpha\beta}_{\mathrm{matter}}$, ensuring manifest covariance. The resulting density-responsive scalar energy $\rho_\Phi$ exhibits dual behavior: (i) in high-density regimes, it saturates at $\rho_\Phi \leq AM_P^4/2$, providing a Planck-scale upper bound on the total energy density that regularizes classical singularities; (ii) in low-density regimes, it approaches a constant $\rho_\Phi \to AM_U^4$, driving cosmic acceleration as dynamical dark energy. A natural renormalization group evolution with an anomalous dimension $\gamma \approx 0.501$ connects the Planck scale to the meV dark energy scale without fine-tuning. The model makes distinctive, testable predictions: $w_0 \approx -0.99$ and $w_a \approx +0.03$, where the positive $w_a$ distinguishes it from $\Lambda$CDM and standard quintessence models. Despite the novel interaction terms, the fifth forces are suppressed by $\beta_{\rm eff} \propto 1/\rho_m^2$, yielding factors below $10^{-58}$ in laboratory environments, and ensuring compatibility with all precision gravity tests. This framework demonstrates how a single quantum field theory mechanism can simultaneously address UV singularities and IR dark energy, providing concrete predictions for future Stage-IV cosmological surveys.",
New submissions,From Explicit Diffeomorphism Breaking to Spontaneous Unimodularization,"Yuri Bonder,Johas D. Morales",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"This contribution investigates modifications of General Relativity that allow or mimic energy nonconservation. We focus on Unimodular Gravity (UG), a theory that explicitly breaks diffeomorphism invariance, and show that it can lead to particle acceleration, opening the door to experimental constraints. We also argue that UG admits a well-posed initial value formulation, despite the presence of nondynamical structures. Finally, we introduce a simple model that spontaneously mimics UG, but in which a cosmological constant cannot arise as an integration constant.",
New submissions,Accelerated inference of binary black-hole populations from the stochastic gravitational-wave background,"G. Giarda,A. I. Renzini,C. Pacilio,D. Gerosa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to observe $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ of overlapping signals per year from a multitude of astrophysical sources that will be computationally challenging to resolve individually. On the other hand, the stochastic background resulting from the entire population of sources encodes information about the underlying population, allowing for population parameter inference independent and complementary to that obtained with individually resolved events. Parameter estimation in this case is still computationally challenging, as computing the power spectrum involves sampling $\sim 10^5$ sources for each set of hyperparameters describing the binary population. In this work, we build on recently developed importance sampling techniques to compute the SGWB efficiently and train neural networks to interpolate the resulting background. We show that a multi-layer perceptron can encode the model information, allowing for significantly faster inference. We test the network assuming an observing setup with CE and ET sensitivities, where for the first time we include the intrinsic variance of the SGWB in the inference, as in this setup it presents a dominant source of measurement noise.",
New submissions,Regular Spacetimes in the Effective Metric Description,"Mattia Damia Paciarini,Mikołaj Myszkowski,Francesco Sannino,Vania Vellucci",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Over the past few decades, significant effort has been directed towards developing various regularized models for compact objects. Recently, a new observable-based parametrization was introduced to account for black hole deformations in a model-independent fashion, referred to as the Effective Metric Description (EMD) \cite{Binetti:2022xdi, DelPiano:2023fiw, DelPiano:2024gvw, DelPiano:2024nrl}. In this paper, we carry out a systematic investigation of the regularity of static and spherically symmetric spacetimes by extending the EMD. We derive the conditions under which curvature scalars remain finite everywhere and the associated spacetime is geodesically complete. Our results are then used to classify the cores of regular spacetimes based on their asymptotic behavior near the origin. To illustrate our findings, we apply our regularity conditions to known black hole examples.",
New submissions,Thermal Fisher information for a rotating BTZ black hole,"Everett A. Patterson,Robert B. Mann",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Relativistic quantum metrology provides a framework within which we can quantify the quality of measurement and estimation procedures while accounting for both quantum and relativistic effects. The chief measure for describing such procedures is the Fisher information, which quantifies how sensitive a given estimation is to a variance of some underlying parameter. Recently, the Fisher information has been used to quantify the spacetime information accessible to two-level quantum particle detectors. We have previously shown that such a system is capable of discerning black hole mass for static black holes in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we extend these results to the astrophysically interesting case of rotating black holes and show that the Fisher information is also sensitive to the rotation of a black hole.",
New submissions,Cosmological effect of coherent oscillation of ultralight scalar fields in a multicomponent universe,"Priyanka Saha,Dipanjan Dey,Kaushik Bhattacharya",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The idea that coherent oscillations of a scalar field, oscillating over a time period that is much shorter than the cosmological timescale, can exhibit cold dark matter (CDM) like behavior was previously established. In our work we first show that this equivalence between the oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector is exact only in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in the absence of cosmological constant and any other possible matter components in the universe when the mass of the scalar field is very large compared to the Hubble parameter. Then we show how to generalize the equivalence between the coherently oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector in a spatially curved universe with multiple matter components. Using our general method, we will show how a coherently oscillating scalar field model can represent the CDM sector in the presence of non-minimal coupling of the CDM sector with radiation. Our method is powerful enough to work out the dynamics of gravitational collapse in a closed FLRW spacetime where the coherently oscillating scalar field model represents the CDM sector. We have, for the first time, presented a consistent method which specifies how a coherently oscillating scalar field model, where the scalar field is ultralight, acts like the CDM sector in a multicomponent universe.",
New submissions,Gravitational wave propagation in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity,"Cláudio Gomes,João Luís Rosa,Miguel A. S. Pinto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work we analyze the propagation properties of gravitational waves in the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity theory. We introduce the scalar-tensor representation of the theory to make explicit the scalar degrees of freedom of the theory and obtain their equations of motion in a form decoupled from the metric tensor. Then, we introduce linear perturbations for the metric tensor and for the two scalar fields and obtain the propagation equations for these three quantities. We analyzed the theory both at non-linear and at linear level through the Newman-Penrose formalism so to find the polarization states. We show that the tensor modes propagate at the speed of light and feature the usual +- and x-polarization modes also present in General Relativity (GR), plus two additional polarization modes: a longitudinal mode and a breathing mode, described by the same additional degree of freedom. On the other hand, the theory features two additional scalar modes not present in GR. These modes are massive and, thus, propagate with a speed smaller than the speed of light in general. The masses of the scalar modes depend solely on the interaction potential between the two scalar fields in the theory, which suggests that one can always fine-tune the potential to make the scalar modes massless and reduce their propagation speed to the speed of light. Given the possibility of fine-tuning the theory to match the observational predictions of GR and in the absence of any measured deviations, these features potentially render the hybrid metric-Palatini theory unfalsifiable in the context of gravitational wave propagation.",
New submissions,Curvature-Enhanced Inertia in Curved Spacetimes: An ADM-Based Formalism with Multipole Connections,Ilias Kynigalakis,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a covariant definition of an inertia tensor on spatial hypersurfaces in general relativity, constructed via integrals of geodesic distance functions using the exponential map. In the ADM 3+1 decomposition, we consider a spacelike slice (Sigma, gamma_ij) with induced metric gamma_ij, lapse N, shift N^i, and a mass-energy density rho(x) on Sigma. At each point p in Sigma, we define a Riemannian inertia tensor I_p(u,v) as an integral over Sigma involving geodesic distances and the exponential map. This reduces to the Newtonian inertia tensor in the flat-space limit. An expansion in Riemann normal coordinates shows curvature corrections involving the spatial Riemann tensor. We apply this to two cases: (i) for closed or open FLRW slices, a spherical shell of matter has an effective moment of inertia scaled by (chi_0 / sin(chi_0))^2 > 1 or (chi_0 / sinh(chi_0))^2 < 1, confirming that positive curvature increases and negative curvature decreases inertia; and (ii) for a slowly rotating relativistic star (Hartle--Thorne approximation), we recover the known result: I = (8 pi / 3) integral from 0 to R of rho(r) exp(-(nu + lambda)/2) [omega_bar(r)/Omega] r^4 dr. In the Newtonian limit, this becomes I_Newt = (8 pi / 3) integral from 0 to R of rho(r) r^4 dr. We show that I_p reproduces these corrections and encodes post-Newtonian contributions consistent with Thorne's and Dixon's multipole formalisms. We also discuss the relation to Geroch--Hansen moments and propose an extension to dynamical slices involving extrinsic curvature. This work thus provides a unified, geometric account of inertia and multipole structure in general relativity, bridging Newtonian intuition and relativistic corrections.",
New submissions,Probing Dark Matter's Gravitational Effects Locally with TianQin,"Zheng-Cheng Liang,Fa-Peng Huang,Xuefeng Zhang,Yi-Ming Hu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we explore the potential of using TianQin missions to probe the local gravitational effects of dark matter. The TianQin project plans to launch satellites at both low and high orbits. High-precision orbit determination is expected to assist in the Earth's gravity or gravitational waves detection. By comparing the derived masses in low and high orbits, it is possible to constrain the amount of dark matter between the two spheres, hence placing a local constraint on dark matter's gravity effect. Our results show the capability of TianQin in detecting the density of dark matter around Earth, with an ultimate sensitivity to a value of $10^{-8}\,\,{\rm kg\,\,m^{-3}}$. This detection limit surpasses the estimated bounds for the solar system and the observation results for our Galaxy by approximately 7 and 14 orders of magnitude, respectively.",
New submissions,Shadow and strong-field lensing effects of quantum-corrected RN blackhole,"Nikko John Leo S. Lobos,Virginia C. Fernandez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the effects of a quantum-corrected RN black hole on the shadow using Perlick methodology and strong-field gravitational lensing using Tsukamoto's approach. Our analysis shows that even at extreme charge, the predicted shadow remains within the observational bounds set by the Event Horizon Telescope for both M87* and Sgr A*. The charge significantly influences the deflection angle near the photon sphere, while its effect diminishes at larger distances. In contrast, the quantum correction parameter, $\mathrm{a}$, exhibits negligible impact at the current observational scale. However, a slight increase in the shadow radius and a corresponding decrease in the strong deflection angle are observed as, $\mathrm{a}$, increases. These results underscore the subtle but theoretically consistent role of quantum corrections in black hole observables.",
New submissions,"Logarithmic and Strong Coupling Models in Weyl-Type $f(Q,T)$ Gravity","Rahul Bhagat,S. K. Tripathy,B. Mishra",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we have explored the cosmological implications of Weyl-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity, a modified gravitational theory formulated from Weyl geometry. The nonmetricity scalar $Q$ is coupled to the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor. We analyze two models based on the logarithmic and strong coupling form of the function $f(Q,T)$. The corresponding field equations are then solved numerically after reformulating the system in terms of redshift. We used combined dataset from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon$^+$ supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and performed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the model parameters. Using the constrained parameters, the geometrical and dynamical aspects of the models are analyzed. The results successfully describe a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion for both the models. The models mostly exhibit quintessence-like behavior and asymptotically approach the $\Lambda$CDM scenario at late times. The calculated age of the Universe from each model aligns with constraints from Planck and stellar age data. The violation of the strong energy condition and the satisfaction of null energy condition and dominant energy conditions are shown.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics of black and white holes in ensemble of Planckons,G.E. Volovik,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The Tsallis-Cirto non-extensive statistics with $\delta=2$ describes the processes of splitting and merging of black holes and their thermodynamics. Here we consider a toy model, which matches this generalized statistics and extends it by providing the integer valued entropy of the black hole, $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. In this model the black hole consists of $N$ the so-called Planckons -- objects with reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ -- so that its mass is quantized, $M=Nm_{\rm P}$. The entropy of each Planckon is zero, but the entropy of black hole with $N$ Planckons is provided by the $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom -- the correlations between the gravitationally attracted Planckons. This toy model can be extended to a charged Reissner-Nordström (RN) black hole, which consists of charged Planckons. Despite the charge, the statistical ensemble of Planckons remains the same, and the RN black hole with $N$ Planckons has the same entropy as the electrically neutral hole, $S_{\rm RNBH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. This is supported by the adiabatic process of transformation from the RN to Schwarzschild black hole by varying the fine structure constant. The adiabaticity is violated in the extreme limit, when the gravitational interaction between two Planckons is compensated by the repulsion between their electric charges, and the RN black hole loses stability. The entropy of a white hole formed by the same $N$ Planckons has negative entropy, $S_{\rm WH}(N)=-N(N-1)/2$.",
New submissions,Stochastic background of gravitational waves from cosmic-rays,"Aurélien Barrau,Juan García-Bellido,Killian Martineau,Daryna Yushchenko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Cosmic-rays are charged particles moving in magnetic fields. They not only emit well-known synchrotron photons but also gravitational radiation. We clarify the characteristics of the gravitational wave signal in this specific situation and underline some unexpected features. A phenomenological approximation for the radiated power is given. We derive the shape and peaking frequency of the associated stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves for both electrons and protons, either of galactic or extra-galactic origin.",
New submissions,"Cosmological Analysis of $f(R,Σ, T)$ Gravity via $O_m(z)$ Reconstruction: Implications into Dark Energy Dynamics","S. H. Shekh,Anil Kumar Yadav,Anirudh Pradhan,N. Myrzakulov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study investigates the cosmological implications of $f(R,\Sigma,T)$ gravity by reconstructing the Hubble parameter from a logarithmic parameterization of the $O_m(z)$ diagnostic. Our approach offers a model-independent way to probe the nature of dark energy and differentiate it from a cosmological constant. We derive the field equations for $f(R,\Sigma,T) = R + \Sigma + 2\pi\eta T$ within the homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric. A comprehensive analysis of key physical parameters, including the equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega(z)$, the $(\omega-\omega')$-plane, the squared sound speed $\vartheta^2$, and various energy conditions (Null, Dominant, Strong), is presented. Our findings reveal a dynamic EoS parameter that consistently remains within the quintessence regime ($-1 < \omega < -1/3$), approaching $\omega = -1$ in the far future, thereby avoiding phantom behavior and maintaining the weak energy condition. The model successfully reproduces the cosmic transition from deceleration to acceleration, as indicated by the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ crossing zero. While the model aligns well with observational data for cosmic expansion, the analysis of $\vartheta^2$ indicates classical instability, a point requiring further theoretical refinement. Overall, this work demonstrates the viability of $f(R,\Sigma,T)$ gravity as a framework capable of describing the universe's accelerated expansion, consistent with current cosmological observations, while offering a dynamic alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM model.",
New submissions,Lorentz violation signatures in the low-energy sector of Hořava gravity from black hole shadow observations,"Wentao Liu,Hongxia Huang,Di Wu,Jieci Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we use the Hořava gravity model and EHT observations of supermassive black holes (BHs) to investigate signatures of Lorentz violation in real astrophysical environments. The Lorentz violation in the rotating Hořava BH spacetime are confined to the strong gravitational field region, being induced by the BH's rotation. Due to the non-separability of the photon motion equations in this spacetime, we employed a numerical backward ray-tracing method to generate shadow images for various BH parameters. Subsequently, we extracted coordinate positions characterizing the shadow shape from high-pixel images to evaluate the parameter space of the BH. When evaluating M87*, Lorentz violation can occur with arbitrary strength. However, for Sgr A*, we can impose certain parameter constraints on Lorentz violation. These constraints depend on the BH's spin. If future observations confirm Sgr A*'s spin parameter less than 0.81 at maximum inclination, current EHT results would challenge general relativity and support Lorentz violation in low-energy regimes.",
New submissions,Microphysical Origins of Gravitational Potentials in Astrophysical Systems,Meir Shimon,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Most astrophysical systems (except for very compact objects such as, e.g., black holes and neutron stars) in our universe are characterized by shallow gravitational potentials, with dimensionless compactness parameter. While the existence and characteristic scales of such virialized systems depend on gravity, we demonstrate that the value of the compactness -- and thus the non-relativistic nature of most astrophysical objects -- arises from microphysical parameters, specifically the fine structure constant and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and is fundamentally independent of the gravitational constant G. It then follows that large-scale astrophysical velocities and escape velocities associated with virialized systems are determined by electromagnetic and atomic physics, not by gravitation, and that the compactness is always set by microphysical scales -- even for the most compact objects, such as neutron stars, where the compactness is determined by quantities like the pion-to-proton mass ratio. This observation, largely overlooked in the literature, explains why the universe is not dominated by relativistic, compact objects and connects the low entropy of the observable universe to underlying microphysics. Our results emphasize the central but underappreciated role played by dimensionless microphysical constants in shaping the macroscopic gravitational landscape of the universe. In particular, we clarify that this independence of compactness from G applies specifically to entire, virialized, naturally formed astrophysical systems -- such as stars, galaxies, and planets -- that have reached equilibrium through self-gravity and microphysical processes. In contrast, arbitrary non-virialized subsystems (e.g., a piece cut from a planet) do not exhibit this property.",
New submissions,Regular Power-Maxwell Black Holes,"Yi-bo Liang,Hong-Rong Li",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a new class of regular, spherically symmetric spacetimes in nonlinear electrodynamics that are asymptotically dynamical but not de Sitter, exhibiting power-law Maxwell behavior at infinity. Starting from magnetic solutions, we demonstrate that the weak energy condition is satisfied, while the dominant energy condition is also fulfilled. These configurations are extended to include regular black holes, with their existence conditions and global structures analyzed via novel Penrose diagrams. Through FP duality, we obtain corresponding electric solutions and establish uniqueness criteria. However, in square-root--Maxwell theory, electric duals are absent; we address this by introducing an auxiliary scalar field formulation that restores duality and yields a generalized transformation. We further investigate the effective metric governing light propagation, finding that it remains regular for some magnetic cases (in the absence of black holes) but becomes singular for electric ones. Furthermore, we identify spacelike photon trajectories in these spacetimes, signaling the existence of causality issues. Finally, we derive the first law and Smarr formula, showing the existence of thermodynamically stable black holes with positive heat capacity.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Waves from Spectator Scalar Fields,"Marcos A. G. Garcia,Sarunas Verner",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a novel mechanism for gravitational wave (GW) production sourced by spectator scalar fields during inflation. These fields, while not driving cosmic expansion, generate blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations that naturally satisfy current CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced power spectra at smaller scales accessible to GW detectors. The resulting GW spectrum spans an exceptionally broad frequency range from $10^{-20}$ to $1$ Hz, with amplitudes ranging from $\Omega_{\text{GW}}h^2 \sim 10^{-20}$ to $10^{-12}$ depending on the reheating temperature and spectator field mass. For heavy spectator fields with effective masses near the inflationary Hubble scale $H_I$, the mechanism produces observable signals across multiple detector bands accessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and ground-based detectors. Our analysis reveals multiple complementary constraints on spectator field parameters. GW-induced limits on the effective number of relativistic species ($\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$) require $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.61 H_I$, stronger than CMB isocurvature bounds alone ($m_\chi \gtrsim 0.54 H_I$). The non-observation of primordial B-modes by \textit{Planck} provides stronger constraints $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.66 H_I$, with projected LiteBIRD sensitivity potentially reaching $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.70 H_I$. This mechanism enables a unique multi-messenger probe of beyond the Standard Model physics during inflation, providing simultaneous constraints on inflationary dynamics, dark matter production, and reheating through current and next-generation GW experiments.",
Cross submissions,"Algebras, Entanglement Islands, and Observers","Hao Geng,Yikun Jiang,Jiuci Xu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Some recent work has postulated the existence of an ""observer"" for a consistent definition of subregion algebras in gravitational universes. The subregion algebras consist of operators dressed to this ""observer"" and are typically Type II von Neumann algebras. Nevertheless, as opposed to standard physical systems, such an ""observer"" was postulated to have a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\text{obs}}$ linear in phase space variable. This linear form suggests that the complete dynamics of such an ""observer"" should also be controlled by an external system or some underlying degrees of freedom within the system. In this paper, we show that this is exactly the case in the island model. In the island model, we have a gravitational asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime coupled with a non-gravitational bath, and the diffeomorphism symmetries in the gravitational AdS are spontaneously broken due to the bath coupling. In this setup, the ""observer"" is constructed using the Goldstone vector field associated with the spontaneously broken diffeomorphism symmetry, and the external system that also controls the dynamics of the ""observer"" is the non-gravitational bath. The basic consistency of the entanglement wedge reconstruction requires operators in the entanglement island to be dressed to this ""observer"". Thus, we establish the result that entanglement islands correspond to emergent Type II$_{\infty}$ von Neumann algebras from the holographic dual perspective. This result relies on assuming the geometric modular flow conjecture. Our study also raises a question for earlier constructions of Type II$_{1}$ von Neumann algebras.",
Cross submissions,Constraining the Mass of a Hypothetical Secondary Black Hole in M87 with the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set,"Motoki Kino,Masahiro Nagashima,Hyunwook Ro,Yuzhu Cui,Kazuhiro Hada,Jongho Park",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Galaxy mergers, each hosting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), are thought to form SMBH binaries. Motivated by recent observations from the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) showing periodic behavior in the M87 jet, a precession of about 11 years and a transverse oscillation of about 0.9 years, we constrain the mass of a hypothetical secondary black hole orbiting the primary SMBH in M87. To constrain the mass ratio between the primary SMBH ($M_{1}$) and the secondary black hole ($M_{2}$) defined as $q \equiv M_{2}/M_{1} \leq 1$, and the length of the semimajor axis of the binary system ($a$), we impose the following three constraints: (i) the lower limit of $a$, below which the SMBH binary is expected to merge. (ii) the strain amplitude of the gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies shown in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. (iii) a finite length of the semimajor axis of $M_{1}$, that can induce periodic behavior in the jet. By combining these constraints, we obtain the allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$. If either of the EAVN-detected periods ($T$) corresponds to the binary's orbital period, the allowed range of $q$ is $6.9 \times 10^{-3} \le q \le 4.2 \times 10^{-2}$ for $T \approx 11$ years, and $3.7\times 10^{-2} \le q \le 1$ for $T \approx 0.9$ years. VLBI astrometric monitoring of the jet base of M87 is essential to explore the allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$.",
Cross submissions,Inflationary attractors and radiative corrections in light of ACT,William J. Wolf,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky-Higgs inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections (which one can argue should be generally expected) calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.",
Cross submissions,Can Non-Relativistic Strings Propagate Without Geometric Baggage?,"Partha Nandi,Sk. Moinuddin,Abdus Sattar",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a minimal and dynamically consistent formulation of non-relativistic bosonic string theory in a Newton-Cartan (NC) background. Starting from a reparametrization-invariant Nambu-Goto action, we develop the Hamiltonian framework and perform a complete Dirac constraint analysis. The resulting structure exhibits first-class constraints that generate worldsheet diffeomorphisms, confirming the internal gauge consistency of the model. Using an interpolating Lagrangian, we derive a Polyakov-type action that enables a direct comparison with symmetry-based constructions known as gauging the algebra (GTA) approaches, which promote non-relativistic symmetry algebras to local symmetries. In contrast to GTA formulations, which require additional background fields to achieve algebraic closure, our model derives all necessary geometric data dynamically from the string evolution itself. This establishes that standard Newton-Cartan geometry is sufficient to support consistent non-relativistic string dynamics. Our results provide a conceptually transparent and technically robust foundation for future studies of non-relativistic string theory in curved backgrounds.",
Cross submissions,Multi-parameter isospectral Fokker-Planck equations,Choon-Lin Ho,Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.",
Cross submissions,Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields,"Simon Brunner,Christian F. Schmidt,Stefan Floerchinger",Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic scalar field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.",
Cross submissions,Revisiting $Λ$CDM extensions in light of re-analyzed CMB data,"Jacobo Asorey,Javier de Cruz Pérez",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the last years with the increasing precision in cosmological observations we have been able to establish an standard model of cosmology, the so-called $\Lambda$CDM, but also find some tensions between cosmological probes that are difficult to explain within the context of this model. We tested several phenomenological extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM with the newest datasets from the chain CMB+BAO+SNIa, to see whether they are able to alleviate the aforementioned tensions. We find that when the updated version of the Planck CMB likelihood (PR4 LoLLiPoP and HiLLiPoP), with respect to the more used likelihoods (PR4 CamSpec and PR3), is considered, the lensing anomaly is reduced, and the preference for $A_L>1$ and $\Omega_k<0$ is less significant. From the CMB+BAO+SNIa dataset, in the context of the parameterization $w_0w_a$CDM we find a preference for a time-evoling dark energy over the rigid cosmological constant which is consistent with the most recent results from DESI collaboration.",
