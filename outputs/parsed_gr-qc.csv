New submissions,Gravitational Baryogenesis Constraints on Nojiri-Odintsov $f(R)$ Gravity,"Kalyan Malakar,Mrinnoy M Gohain,Kalyan Bhuyan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper focuses on exploring the imbalance between matter and antimatter via the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism within the framework of Nojiri-Odintsov $f(R)$ gravity models in a spatially flat FLRW universe, where $R$ is the Ricci curvature scalar. This mechanism is based on \(\mathcal{CP}\)-violation generated via introducing an interaction between baryonic matter current (\(J^\mu\)) and the derivative of curvature scalar (\(\partial_\mu R\)), which finally results in the baryon asymmetry. We examine three distinct $f(R)$ models: (i) \(f(R)=\frac{-\alpha}{R^m}+\frac{R}{2k^2}+\beta R^2\), (ii) \(f(R)=\alpha R^{\gamma} +\beta R^{\delta}\) and (iii) \(f(R)=\frac{\alpha R^{2m}-\beta R^m}{1+\gamma R^m} \). We demonstrate that even during the matter-dominated epoch of the universe, the $f(R)$ gravity models under consideration can yield a non-vanishing matter-antimatter asymmetry. We constrain the model parameters of each model within the scenario of gravitational baryogenesis to produce the observed value of the baryon-to-entropy ratio, providing a continuous set of acceptable physical values for those parameters. Our results show highly consistent agreement to the baryon-to-entropy ratio with the observational bound from the cosmological data.",
New submissions,"Cosmological Analysis of $f(R, Σ, T)$ Gravity with EoS Parameterization","S. H. Shekh,N. Myrzakulov,Anil Kumar Yadav,Anirudh Pradhan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we present a comprehensive cosmological analysis within the framework of $f(R, \Sigma, T)$ gravity, a modified theory that incorporates nonlinear matter-geometry coupling via the inclusion of both the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$ and the scalar $\Sigma = T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$. We consider a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe and introduce a linear parameterization for the equation of state (EoS) parameter based on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) form, which allows us to explore the dynamical evolution of dark energy without imposing restrictive assumptions. To confront the theoretical model with observations, we utilize the latest Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers. The model parameters are constrained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations with the \texttt{emcee} package, leading to tight bounds on the parameters. The analysis reveals that the model remains consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario while allowing mild deviations consistent with observational data. Furthermore, we examine the physical and kinematical features of the model by studying the behavior of the physical parameters. Finally, the calculated age of the universe within this framework is found to be in excellent agreement with Planck 2018 results, highlighting the and viability of $f(R, \Sigma, T)$ gravity as a candidate for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration.",
New submissions,Cosmological perturbations for smooth sign-switching dark energy models,"Mariam Bouhmadi-López,Beñat Ibarra-Uriondo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant. Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.",
New submissions,Equilibrium models of Weyssenhoff spin fluid accretion tori around Kerr black holes,"Sergio Gimeno-Soler,Sayantani Lahiri,Claus Lämmerzahl",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The construction of equilibrium models of accretion disks around compact objects has become a highly relevant topic in the recent times, thanks to the current understanding that indicates a direct relationship between these objects with the electromagnetic emission of supermassive compact objects residing at center of the galaxies M87 and Milky Way, both observed by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. As the physical properties of the compact sources are estimated using the results of computer simulations of the system comprising of the disk plus the compact object, adding new physical ingredients to the initial data of the simulation is pertinent to enhance our knowledge about these objects. In this work, we thus present equilibrium solutions of geometrically thick, non-self-gravitating, constant orbital specific angular momentum, neutral Weyssenhoff spin fluid accretion tori in the Kerr spacetime, building upon a previous work that was restricted to the Schwarzschild geometry. Our models are obtained under the assumptions of stationarity and axisymmetry in the fluid quantities, circularity of the flow and a polytropic equation of state. We study how the deviations from an ideal no-spin fluid depend on both the magnitude of the macroscopic spin of the fluid and on the spin parameter of the Kerr black hole, carefully encompassing both the co-rotating and the counter-rotating cases. Our results demonstrate that the characterstic radii, the thickness and the radial extent of such a torus can change importantly in the presence of the macroscopic spin of the ideal fluid. We also find some limitations of our approach that constraint the amount of spin the fluid can have in the rotating Kerr background. Finally, we present a parameter space exploration that gives us additional constraints on the possible values of the fluid spin denoted by the parameter $s_0$.",
New submissions,Schwarzschild Black Holes Immersed in Born-Infeld Magnetic Fields and Their Observational Signatures,"Yiqian Chen,Guangzhou Guo,Benrong Mu,Peng Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the influence of Born-Infeld (BI) nonlinear electrodynamics on magnetic field configurations, photon orbits, and black hole shadows for Schwarzschild black holes immersed in magnetic fields. Assuming that the BI magnetic fields are asymptotically uniform and aligned with the polar axis, we solve the nonlinear magnetic field equations numerically using pseudospectral methods. Our analysis shows that nonlinear electromagnetic effects become prominent near the event horizon, particularly in the polar regions, where the magnetic field strength is significantly enhanced. This enhancement leads to closed photon orbits on the meridional plane becoming prolate, with noticeable stretching along the polar axis. Simulations of black hole images reveal that, at high observer inclinations, the shadow, which is circular in the Maxwell limit, becomes increasingly elongated along the polar direction as the nonlinear effects increase.",
New submissions,Nonlocal correlations for semiclassical states in loop quantum gravity,"Filipe H. C. Menezes,Nelson Yokomizo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We compute the two-point correlation function of the area operator for semiclassical states of loop quantum gravity in the limit of large spins. The cases of intrinsic and extrinsic coherent states are considered, along with a new class of semiclassical states constructed as perturbations of Livine-Speziale coherent states. For the usual coherent states, the correlations are shown to be short-ranged, decaying exponentially with the distance. Introducing perturbations given by correlated elementary excitations and decays of the gravitational field along pairs of loops, we obtain new states that, while preserving the peakedness properties of the unperturbed states, can also display long-ranged correlations. The perturbed coherent states include examples reproducing the typical decay of correlations for quantum fluctuations of the geometry associated with free gravitons on a background metric. Such a behavior is a natural requirement for the compatibility of semiclassical states in quantum gravity with the physical regime pictured by perturbative quantum gravity.",
New submissions,LQG inspired spacetimes as solutions of the Einstein equations,"Marcos V. de S. Silva,Carlos F. S. Pereira,G. Alencar,Celio R. Muniz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Black bounces are compact objects with a wormhole structure hidden behind an event horizon. This type of metric can be obtained through general relativity by considering the presence of exotic matter. Such spacetimes can also arise within the framework of effective theories inspired by loop quantum gravity. In this work, we verify the possibility of obtaining black bounce models inspired by loop quantum gravity as solutions of general relativity. For this, we examine which sources can generate these solutions and the consequences of using these types of sources. We find that the sources can be expressed as a combination of a phantom scalar field and nonlinear electrodynamics. Once we obtain the sources in terms of fields, we analyze the energy conditions for each field separately to verify which of the fields is responsible for the violation of the energy conditions.",
New submissions,Marginally stable Schwarzschild-black-hole-non-minimally-coupled-Proca-field bound-state configurations,Shahar Hod,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"It has recently been revealed that, in curved black-hole spacetimes, non-minimally coupled massive Proca fields may be characterized by the existence of poles in their linearized perturbation equations and may therefore develop exponentially growing instabilities. Interestingly, recent numerical computations [H. W. Chiang, S. Garcia-Saenz, and A. Sang,arXiv:2504.04779] have provided compelling evidence that the onset of monopole instabilities in the composed black-hole-field system is controlled by the dimensionless physical parameter $\mu r_-$, where $\mu$ is the proper mass of the non-minimally coupled Proca field and $r_-\equiv (-2\alpha)^{1/3}r_{\text{H}}$ is the radial location of the pole [here $\alpha$ is the non-minimal coupling parameter of the Einstein-Proca theory and $r_{\text{H}}$ is the radius of the black-hole horizon]. In the present paper we use {\it analytical} techniques in order to explore the physical properties of critical (marginally-stable) composed Schwarzschild-black-hole-nonminimally-coupled-monopole-Proca-field configurations. In particular, we derive a remarkably compact analytical formula for the discrete spectrum $\{\mu(r_{\text{H}},r_-;n) \}^{n=\infty}_{n=1}$ of Proca field masses which characterize the critical black-hole-monopole-Proca-field configurations in the dimensionless regime ${r_- -r_{\text{H}}\over{r_{\text{H}}}}\ll1$ of near-horizon poles. The physical significance of the analytically derived resonance spectrum stems from the fact that the critical field mass $\mu_{\text{c}}\equiv\mu(r_{\text{H}},r_-;n=1)$ marks the onset of instabilities in the Schwarzschild-black-hole-nonminimally-coupled-monopole-Proca-field system. In particular, composed black-hole-linearized-Proca-field configurations in the small-mass regime $\mu\leq\mu_{\text{c}}$ of the Proca field are stable.",
Cross submissions,A Fog Over the Cosmological SGWB: Unresolved Massive Black Hole Binaries in the LISA Band,"Mesut Çalışkan,Neha Anil Kumar,Marc Kamionkowski,Sihao Cheng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Disentangling the rich astrophysical structure of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from its cosmological component is essential for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to access the physics of the early Universe beyond the reach of any other probe. In this work, we develop an analytical framework to compute the astrophysical contribution to the SGWB arising from an unresolved ensemble of inspiraling and merging black hole binaries. Accounting for various resolvability thresholds, we leverage this framework to predict the amplitude, spectral shape, and detection signal-to-noise ratio of the unresolved background from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), capturing the possible diversity of its SGWB imprint across a range of astrophysically motivated populations. Through a joint analysis of astrophysical and primordial contributions to the SGWB, we determine the minimum detectable amplitude of the cosmological background across a range of spectral shapes. We demonstrate that, even under optimistic subtraction thresholds, unresolved MBHBs can degrade the detectability of a cosmological signal by multiple orders of magnitude, depending on the spectral shape of the primordial component. Ultimately, the MBHB-induced astrophysical SGWB acts both as a veil and a lens: it imposes a fundamental limit on cosmological sensitivity, yet simultaneously reveals the hidden population of massive black holes beyond the reach of individual detections. Accurate modeling of this late-Universe background is therefore a prerequisite for robust component separation and for realizing LISA's full scientific potential.",
Cross submissions,Validating Sequential Monte Carlo for Gravitational-Wave Inference,"Michael J. Williams,Minas Karamanis,Yilin Luo,Uroš Seljak",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Nested sampling (NS) is the preferred stochastic sampling algorithm for gravitational-wave inference for compact binary coalenscences (CBCs). It can handle the complex nature of the gravitational-wave likelihood surface and provides an estimate of the Bayesian model evidence. However, there is another class of algorithms that meets the same requirements but has not been used for gravitational-wave analyses: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), an extension of importance sampling that maps samples from an initial density to a target density via a series of intermediate densities. In this work, we validate a type of SMC algorithm, called persistent sampling (PS), for gravitational-wave inference. We consider a range of different scenarios including binary black holes (BBHs) and binary neutron stars (BNSs) and real and simulated data and show that PS produces results that are consistent with NS whilst being, on average, 2 times more efficient and 2.74 times faster. This demonstrates that PS is a viable alternative to NS that should be considered for future gravitational-wave analyses.",
Cross submissions,Tails from the Bulk: Gravitational Decay in AdS$_5$,"John R. V. Crump,Jorge E. Santos",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS black holes in $d = 5$ and identify a regime of late-time power-law decay for smooth initial data. Based on an analysis of the quasinormal mode spectrum, we predict and characterise this decay behaviour. We perform fully nonlinear numerical evolutions with long integration times that support the prediction and exhibit no signs of instability. Remarkably, the decay is modulated by a universal oscillatory pattern, consistent with subleading corrections from a large-angular-momentum (eikonal) analysis of the quasinormal mode spectrum.",
Cross submissions,Magnetic Field Configurations in Binary Neutron Star Mergers I: Post-merger Remnant and Disk,"Eduardo M. Gutiérrez,William Cook,David Radice,Sebastiano Bernuzzi,Jacob Fields,Peter Hammond,Boris Daszuta,Harshraj Bandyopadhyay,Maximilian Jacobi",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed with the code GR-Athena++. We investigate how a different initial magnetic field configuration, nuclear equation of state, or binary mass ratio affects the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution of the post-merger remnant and disk. We also analyze the impact of the commonly-assumed reflection (bitant) symmetry across the equatorial plane. Magnetic field amplification occurs shortly after the merger due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; later, the field keeps evolving with a predominantly toroidal configuration due to winding and turbulence. The initial magnetic field topology leaves an imprint on the field structure and affects magnetic field amplification for the initial magnetic field values commonly assumed in the literature and the limited resolution of the simulations. Enforcing equatorial reflection symmetry partially suppresses the development of turbulence near the equatorial plane and impacts the post-merger magnetic field evolution. Stiffer EOSs produce larger, less compact remnants that may retain memory of the pre-merger strong poloidal field.",
Cross submissions,"Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK","Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez,Jiuci Xu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the ""fake disk"" geometry. The effective ""fake temperature"" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.",
Cross submissions,Dark Energy Crosses the Line: Quantifying and Testing the Evidence for Phantom Crossing,"Emre Özülker,Eleonora Di Valentino,William Giarè",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Combinations of the most recent CMB, BAO, and SNeIa datasets, when analyzed using the CPL parametrization, $w(a) = w_0 + (1 - a) w_a$, exclude $\Lambda$CDM at $\gtrsim\!3\sigma$ in favor of a dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameter that crosses the phantom divide. We confirm this behavior and show that it persists when DESI BAO data are replaced by SH0ES $H_0$ measurements, despite the known tension between these probes in the presence of CMB data. In both cases, the constraints favor a transition from an early-time phantom-like phase to a late-time quintessence-like phase, with the crossing occurring at different redshifts depending on the dataset combination. The probability that a phantom divide line (PDL) crossing does not occur within the expansion history is excluded at significance levels ranging between $3.1\sigma$-$5.2\sigma$. To investigate whether the apparent PDL crossing is a genuine feature preferred by the data or an artifact of the linear form of the CPL parametrization, we isolate the PDL crossing feature by introducing two modified versions of CPL that explicitly forbid it: CPL${}_{>a_\mathrm{c}}$ and CPL${}_{<a_\mathrm{c}}$. These models are physically motivated in that they phenomenologically capture the behavior of thawing and freezing scalar field scenarios. While previous studies have primarily considered thawing quintessence as a non-crossing alternative, we find that a freezing phantom-like model is the only one capable of performing comparably to CPL -- and only in a few cases. Nevertheless, across all dataset combinations considered, the standard CPL model consistently provides the best fit, strongly indicating that the data genuinely favor a PDL crossing.",
Cross submissions,Holomorphic Unified Field Theory of Gravity and the Standard Model,"John. W. Moffat,Ethan. J. Thompson",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present a holomorphic framework in which gravity, gauge interactions, and their couplings to charges and currents emerge from a single geometric action on a four-complex-dimensional manifold. The Hermitian metric yields on the real slice $y^\mu = 0$, a real symmetric metric $g_{(\mu \nu)}$ giving the vacuum Einstein equations, and an antisymmetric part $g_{[\mu \nu]}$ that reproduces Maxwell's equations with sources. A single holomorphic gauge connection for $G_{\text{GUT}}$, such as $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$, encodes all gauge sectors; its Bianchi identities give homogeneous Yang--Mills equations, and variation imposes $\nabla_\mu F^{\mu \nu}_A = J^\nu_A$. Chiral fermions arise from a holomorphic Dirac Lagrangian and couple minimally to all gauge fields, reproducing the Standard Model spectrum. Anomaly cancellation follows from holomorphic gauge invariance. A holomorphic adjoint Higgs breaks $G_{\text{GUT}} \rightarrow SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ with unified coupling, and a second Higgs breaks electroweak symmetry, generating $W^\pm$, $Z$, and fermion masses. Below the unification scale, couplings run by standard renormalization-group flow. This construction unifies Einstein gravity, Yang--Mills theory, electromagnetism, and chiral fermions into a single classical geometric framework, and admits quantization via a holomorphic path integral that reproduces standard Feynman rules.",
Cross submissions,Vacuum energy in effective field theory of general relativity,"E. Epelbaum,J. Gegelia,Ulf-G. Meißner",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"It is shown to all orders of perturbation theory that in the effective field theory of general relativity the condition of vanishing of the vacuum energy leads to the same value of the cosmological constant, viewed as a parameter of the effective Lagrangian, as obtained by demanding the consistency of the effective field theory in Minkowski background. The resulting effective action is characterized by the cosmological constant term that vanishes exactly.",
Cross submissions,Bispectrum Islands,"Claudia de Rham,Sadra Jazayeri,Andrew J. Tolley",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inspired by the amplitude bootstrap program, the spirit of this work is to constrain the space of consistent inflationary correlation functions - specifically, the bispectrum of curvature perturbations - using fundamental principles such as unitarity, locality, analyticity, and symmetries. To this end, we assume a setup for inflation in which de Sitter isometries are only mildly broken by the slow roll of the inflaton field, and study the bispectrum imprinted by a generic hidden sector during inflation. Assuming that the hidden sector's contributions to primordial non-Gaussianity are dominated by the exchange of a scalar operator (which does not preclude high-spin UV completions), we derive nontrivial positivity constraints on the resulting bispectrum $B(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. In particular, we show that $B$ must be negative in a certain region around the equilateral configuration. For instance, for isosceles triangles (with $k_2=k_3$) this region is given by $0.027\lesssim k_3/k_1\leq 2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unitarity imposes upper and lower bounds on the bispectrum shape, thereby carving out a Bispectrum Island where consistent shapes in our setup can reside. We complement our analysis by contemplating alternative setups where the coupling to the hidden sector is allowed to strongly break de Sitter boosts. We also identify situations that would push the bispectrum off the island and the profound physical features they would reveal.",
Cross submissions,A Fast Bayesian Method for Coherent Gravitational Wave Searches with Relative Astrometry,"Benjamin Zhang,Kris Pardo,Yijun Wang,Luke Bouma,Tzu-Ching Chang,Olivier Doré",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Using relative stellar astrometry for the detection of coherent gravitational wave sources is a promising method for the microhertz range, where no dedicated detectors currently exist. Compared to other gravitational wave detection techniques, astrometry operates in an extreme high-baseline-number and low-SNR-per-baseline limit, which leads to computational difficulties when using conventional Bayesian search techniques. We extend a technique for efficiently searching pulsar timing array datasets through the precomputation of inner products in the Bayesian likelihood, showing that it is applicable to astrometric datasets. Using this technique, we are able to reduce the total dataset size by up to a factor of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while remaining accurate to within 1% over two orders of magnitude in gravitational wave frequency. Applying this technique to simulated astrometric datasets for the Kepler Space Telescope and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope missions, we obtain forecasts for the sensitivity of these missions to coherent gravitational waves. Due to the low angular sky coverage of astrometric baselines, we find that coherent gravitational wave sources are poorly localized on the sky. Despite this, from $10^{-8}$ Hz to $10^{-6}$ Hz, we find that Roman is sensitive to coherent gravitational waves with an instantaneous strain above $h_0 \simeq 10^{-11.4}$, and Kepler is sensitive to strains above $h_0 \simeq $ $10^{-12.4}$. At this strain, we can detect a source with a frequency of $10^{-7}$ Hz and a chirp mass of $10^9$ $M_\odot$ at a luminosity distance of 3.6 Mpc for Kepler, and 0.3 Mpc for Roman.",
Cross submissions,Building multi-BTZ black holes through Riemann-Hilbert problem,"Jun-ichi Sakamoto,Shinya Tomizawa",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We construct a recently found class of non-BPS black hole solutions with asymptotically $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ in type IIB supergravity, consisting of multiple BTZ black holes localized on an $S^3$, within the group theoretical framework of Breitenlohner and Maison (BM). Starting with the multi-neutral black string solution as a seed, we solve the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem for the BM linear system. First, we determine the monodromy matrix corresponding to this seed solution by generalizing the early work of Katsimpouri et al. on the four-charged black hole of STU supergravity, where some assumptions must be relaxed for the solutions with multiple horizons. By applying the Harrison transformation, a charge-generating transformation in the $SO(4,4)$ group, to the monodromy matrix, we obtain the multi-charged black string solution. Furthermore, through a ``subtraction'' procedure -- an $SO(4,4)$ transformation that changes the asymptotic structure from $R^{1,4}\times S^1\times T^4$ to $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ spacetime -- we derive the multi-BTZ black hole solution. This is the first example in which the subtraction procedure is applied to multiple black holes, and it may also have potential applications to other cases.",
Cross submissions,Detectability of dark matter density distribution via gravitational waves from binary black holes in the Galactic center,"Zhijin Li,Xiao Guo,Zhoujian Cao,Yun-Long Zhang",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.",
Cross submissions,Interior structure of the holographic s + p superconductor and chaotic-stable transition near the black hole singularity,"Xing-Kun Zhang,Xin Zhao,Zhang-Yu Nie,Ya-Peng Hu,Yu-Sen An",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we investigate the interior structure of a holographic multi-band superconductor with the coexistence of s-wave and p-wave order parameters. Especially, we investigate the singularity structure of this multi-band model. Different from the single p-wave case, the alternation rule is jointly determined by parameters involving both s-wave order and p-wave order. In the coexistence region, we derive the Kasner alternation laws from both analytical and numerical methods which fit each other nicely. Furthermore, we find that the occurrence of the s-wave order parameter will lead to a chaotic-stable transition for the near singularity structure which matches the expectation of cosmological billiard approach. This novel transition for the near singularity structure constitutes a holographic counterpart of the secondary condensation in boundary superconducting system, offering a complementary perspective for characterizing the properties of boundary condensed matter systems.",

Specifically, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the energy-momentum conservation and the bulk curvature, co-dimension-two branes fail to support stable de Sitter solutions. For co-dimensions higher than two embedded in a compact internal space, we show that negative tension sources would be required. This result places strong constraints on the viability of higher-dimensional braneworld models as a means to obtain de Sitter space within string theory.",
Cross submissions,Dynamics of discrete spacetimes with Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"Stuart Ferguson,Arad Nasiri,Petros Wallden",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph),"Quantum algorithms offer the potential for significant computational advantages; however, in many cases, it remains unclear how these advantages can be practically realized. Causal Set Theory is a discrete, Lorentz-invariant approach to quantum gravity which may be well positioned to benefit from quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm that investigates the dynamics of causal sets by sampling the space of causal sets, improving on classical methods. Our approach builds on the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo technique developed by Layden et al. [Nature 619, 282 (2023)], adapting it to sample from the constrained spaces required for application. This is done by adding a constraint term to the Hamiltonian of the system. A qubit Hamiltonian representing the Benincasa-Dowker action (the causal set equivalent of the Einstein-Hilbert action) is also derived and used in the algorithm as the problem Hamiltonian. We achieve a super-quadratic quantum scaling advantage and, under some conditions, demonstrate a greater potential compared to classical approaches than previously observed in unconstrained QeMCMC implementations.",
Cross submissions,Energy transport in holographic junctions,"Yan Liu,Chuan-Yi Wang",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study energy transport in a conformal junction connecting three 2D conformal field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The holographic dual consists of three AdS$_3$ spacetimes joined along the worldsheet of a tensile string anchored at the junction. Within a specific range of string tension, where the bulk solution is uniquely determined, we find that all energy reflection and transmission coefficients vary monotonically with the string tension. Notably, the total energy transmission, which quantifies the energy flux from one CFT through the junction, is bounded above by the effective central charge associated with both the CFTs and the junction. Results for energy transport in conformal interfaces are recovered in a special limit. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to junctions connecting $N$ 2D CFTs.",
Cross submissions,Black Holes in the Red-sequence Elliptical Galaxies at Redshifts $\sim 0.7-2.5$: Not Dark Energy Source but Remanants of Little Red Dots,"Lei Lei,Ze-Fan Wang,Yi-Ying Wang,Lei Feng,Yi-Zhong Fan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The nature of dark energy remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern cosmology. One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be the astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling mechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the black hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts $\leq 2.5$. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we show that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy has been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10$\sigma$. Moreover, it turns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized by the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red-sequence elliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the redshifts of $\sim 0.7-2.5$, without the need of black hole cosmological coupling.",

In particular, it leads to an open-closed extension of Virasoro TQFT, which in the classical limit gives rise to 3d gravity with tensionful end-of-the-world branes. It also provides predictions for off-shell manifolds with bordered asymptotic boundaries, such as the annulus wormhole. As an application, we construct a purely open variant of the tensor model to study a purely open bootstrap problem in the context of CFT triangulation. We also briefly discuss the extension to non-orientable CFTs.",
