New submissions,Exploring the dynamics of coincident f(Q) gravity in the presence of DBI-essence scalar field,"Ratul Mandal,Ujjal Debnath,Anirudh Pradhan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In theoretical cosmology, symmetric teleparallel gravity or $f(Q)$ gravity based on nonmetricity tensor Q has become an interesting alternative to General relativity in recent years. The present research paper contains a rigorous dynamical system analysis of coincident f (Q) gravity in the presence of a generalized DBI essence scalar field. We have considered two different models of coincident f(Q) gravity, such as power law model $f(Q) = Q + nQ^m$ and exponential model $f(Q) = Q e^{\frac{\beta Q_0}{Q}}$ respectively, where n, m, \b{eta} are constant parameter and Q is the nonmetricity component. In this study, the generalized DBI essence scalar field acts as an additional dark energy component. After obtaining the field equation for the corresponding cosmological model, we employed several dynamical variables to form the dynamical system. The critical points of these dynamical systems are influenced by cosmological parameters and associated with particular epochs in the cosmological timeline. For different combinations of cosmological parameters, the critical points exhibit different cosmological eras, starting from the accelerated stiff matter era to late-time acceleration phenomena. The stability criteria of each critical point are studied by using linear stability theory, and the physical constraints on the cosmological parameters are also considered during this analysis. Furthermore, the current values of energy densities, deceleration parameters, and equation of state parameters obtained from the evolution diagram are compatible with observational data.",
New submissions,Functional inference on deviations from General Relativity,"Costantino Pacilio,Riccardo Buscicchio",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Extensions of general relativity often predict modifications to gravitational waveform morphology that depend functionally on source parameters, such as the masses and spins of coalescing black holes. However, current analyses of strong-field gravity lack robust, data-driven methods to infer such functional dependencies. In this work, we introduce GRANITA, a non-perturbative, theory-agnostic framework to characterize parameter-dependent deviations from general relativity using Gaussian process regression. Leveraging the flexibility of this method, we analyze both simulated data and real events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA public catalog. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to detect and quantify waveform deviations across the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the method can identify stochastic (non-deterministic) deviations, potentially arising from environmental effects or subdominant unmodeled physics. As gravitational-wave tests of strong gravity advance in precision, our framework provides a principled approach to constrain modified gravity and to mitigate contamination from astrophysical or instrumental systematics.",
New submissions,Chameleon Gravity as an Alternative to Dark Matter,"Raziyeh Zaregonbadi,Nasim Saba,Mehrdad Farhoudi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"By studying the chameleon gravity on galaxy scales, we investigate the effects of the chameleon dark matter. To perform this task, we consider the dynamics of the chameleon scalar field in the region of galactic halos in static spherically symmetric spacetimes that differ only slightly from classical general relativity, but have similar symmetry behind this region. Hence, we demonstrate its ability to act as dark matter. In fact, by obtaining the expression for the tangential speed in this region, we apply this approach to explain the issue of flat galactic rotation curves. We obtain that the mass associated with the chameleon scalar field varies linearly with the radius of galaxy, and hence, the tangential speed in that region is constant, which is consistent with observational data without any need to introduce a mysterious dark matter. Accordingly, we show that the presented chameleon gravity has a well-defined Newtonian limit and can describe the geometry of spacetime in the region of flat galactic rotation curves, and is consistent with the corresponding results of the $ \Lambda CDM $ model with the NFW profile. We also consider a test particle moving in a timelike geodesic and obtain the fifth-force, which varies proportionally to the inverse of the radius of galaxy. Moreover, we obtain the effects on the angle representing the deflection of light and on the time representing the radar echo delay of photons passing through the region of galactic halos. We show that as the radius of galaxy increases, the effect on the angle of light passing through the region around galactic halos decreases. Also, the obtained result indicates that the relevant time delay decreases with increasing radius towards the end of the galactic halo.",
New submissions,Quasinormal Modes of a Massive Scalar Field in Slowly Rotating Einstein-Bumblebee Black Holes,"Weike Deng,Wentao Liu,Fen Long,Kui Xiao,Jiliang Jing",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we examine the impacts of black hole spin, Lorentz-violating parameter, and the scalar field's mass on quasinormal modes (QNMs) of rotating Einstein-Bumblebee black holes, including computations up to the second-order expansion in rotation parameters. We investigate two classes of Lorentz-violating rotating black holes: one constructed via the Newman-Janis algorithm and the other obtained by solving the field equations through a series expansion. Within the slow-rotation approximation framework, we derive the master equations governing a massive scalar field and compute the corresponding QNM frequencies numerically using both the continued fraction method and the matrix method. The numerical results indicate that the QNM frequencies exhibit increased sensitivity to negative $\ell$ variations, which reduces the influence of the field mass parameter $\tilde{\mu}$. Meanwhile, the spectral ""cube"" of NJA black holes shows slight compression for $m>0$ with $ \ell>0 $ and expansion for $m<0$ with $ \ell>0 $ compared to another black holes, where $m$ is approximately proportional to the spin parameter at first order, while richer structures and lifted degeneracy emerge at second order.",
New submissions,Direct Measurement of the Accretion Disk Formed in Prompt Collapse Mergers with Future Gravitational-Wave Observatories,"Arnab Dhani,Alessandro Camilletti,Alessio Ludovico De Santis,Andrea Cozzumbo,David Radice,Domenico Logoteta,Albino Perego,Jan Harms,Marica Branchesi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The production site of heavy r-process elements, such as Gold and Uranium, is uncertain. Neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical phenomenon in which we have witnessed their formation. However, the amount of heavy elements resulting from the merger remains poorly constrained, mainly due to uncertainties on the mass and angular momentum of the disk formed in the merger remnant. Matter accretion from the disk is also thought to power gamma ray-bursts. We discover from numerical relativity simulations that the accretion disk influences the ringdown gravitational-wave signal produced by binaries that promptly collapse to black-hole at merger. We propose a method to \emph{directly} measure the mass of the accretion disk left during black hole formation in binary mergers using observatories such as the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer with a relative error of 10\% for binaries at a distance of up to 30~Mpc, corresponding to an event rate of 0.001 to 0.25 events per year.",
New submissions,Apparent Horizons Associated with Dynamical Black Hole Entropy,"Hideo Furugori,Kanji Nishii,Daisuke Yoshida,Kaho Yoshimura",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We define entropic marginally outer trapped surfaces (E-MOTSs) as a generalization of apparent horizons. We then show that, under first-order perturbations around a stationary black hole, the dynamical black hole entropy proposed by Hollands, Wald, and Zhang, defined on a background Killing horizon, can be expressed as the Wall entropy evaluated on an E-MOTS associated with it. Our result ensures that the Hollands-Wald-Zhang entropy reduces to the standard Wald entropy in each stationary regime of a dynamical black hole, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the dynamical entropy formulation.",
Cross submissions,Challenges for describing unitary evolution in nontrivial geometries: pictures and representations,"Steven B. Giddings,Julie Perkins",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Description of evolution between spatial slices in a general spacetime suffers from a significant difficulty: the states on the slices, in a given basis, are not related by a unitary transformation. This problem, which occurs in spacetime dimensions above two, is directly related to the infinite number of inequivalent representations of the canonical commutators, and in particular will arise for interacting theories in time-dependent spacetimes. We connect different facets of this issue, and discuss its possible resolution. It is directly related to discussions of failure of a standard Schr√∂dinger picture of evolution, and of evolution via ""many-fingered time."" One requires a condition specifying a physical unitary equivalence class of states; in general this equivalence class evolves with time, and an important question is how it is determined. One approach to this in free theories is by imposing a Hadamard condition on the two point function. We explore a different approach, which also may be helpful for interacting theories, analyzing the structure of the state in a local limit, and relate these approaches. We also elucidate the non-Hadamard behavior of unphysical vacua, and discuss concrete examples of these approaches involving cosmological and black hole evolution. The issues are extended in the context of quantum dynamical geometry, and raise important questions for the proper description of the wavefunction of the universe and for the role of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.",
Cross submissions,Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $Œõ$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum,"Anton Chudaykin,Mikhail M. Ivanov,Oliver H. E. Philcox",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory (EFT)-based full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, carefully accounting for all relevant systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform an EFT-based full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $h=0.707\pm 0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10$\% and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $h=0.688\pm 0.006$, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Finally, the galaxy bispectrum data dramatically improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.",
Cross submissions,Bipartite and tripartite entanglement in pure dephasing relativistic spin-boson model,"Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura,Erickson Tjoa",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study non-perturbatively the entanglement generation between two and three emitters in an exactly solvable relativistic variant of the spin-boson model, equivalent to the time-independent formulation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector model. We show that (i) (highly) entangled states of the two emitters require interactions very deep into the light cone, (ii) the mass of the field can generically improve the entanglement generation, (iii) unlike the bipartite case where it is possible to generate close to maximally entangled states via the spin-boson interactions, the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement is non-perturbatively hard even at sufficiently long times. Result (iii), in particular, suggests that probing the multipartite entanglement of a relativistic quantum field non-perturbatively requires either different probe-based techniques or variants of the UDW model. Along the way we provide the regularity conditions for the $N$-emitter model to have well-defined ground states in the Fock space.",
Cross submissions,"Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Environmental Monitoring, and Newtonian Noise Mitigation:Comparable Sensitivity to Seismometers","Reinhardt Rading,Fracensca Badaracco,Spiridon Beis,Katharina Sophie Isleif,Paul Ophardt,Wanda Vossius, theWAVE Collaboration",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Signal Processing (eess.SP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Newtonian noise limits the low-frequency sensitivity of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. While seismometers and geophones are commonly employed to monitor ground motion for Newtonian noise cancellation, their limited spatial coverage and high deployment costs hinder scalability. In this study, we demonstrate that distributed acoustic sensing offers a viable and scalable alternative, providing performance comparable to that of conventional seismic instruments. Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated seismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong correlation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz frequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed acoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation remains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing accurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As a case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise recorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results with those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed acoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor of 0.11 at 20 Hz. These findings confirm the feasibility of using distributed acoustic sensing for Newtonian noise mitigation and highlight its potential, in combination with traditional seismic sensors, to improve environmental monitoring and noise suppression in current and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.",
Cross submissions,Magnetically Driven Retrograde Precession in Misaligned Black Hole Accretion Flows,"Hong-Xuan Jiang,Yosuke Mizuno,Dong Lai,Indu K. Dihingia,Christian M. Fromm",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Observations of accreting black hole (BH) systems, such as microquasars and supermassive black holes, often reveal a precessing jet with changing directions, indicating a misaligned accretion flow relative to the BH spin. The precession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which arises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion flow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow conditions for M~87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale magnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform large-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a never-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a magnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned with the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the unique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a new interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems.",
Cross submissions,"Microlensing optical depth, event rate, and limits on compact objects in dark matter based on 20 years of OGLE observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud","P. Mr√≥z,A. Udalski,M.K. Szyma≈Ñski,I. Soszy≈Ñski,P. Pietrukowicz,S. Koz≈Çowski,R. Poleski,J. Skowron,D. Skowron,K. Ulaczyk,M. Gromadzki,K. Rybicki,P. Iwanek,M. Wrona,M. Ratajczak",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.",
Cross submissions,Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae data,"Tian-Nuo Li,Guo-Hong Du,Peng-Ju Wu,Jing-Zhao Qi,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.",
Cross submissions,Gravity and the Higgs boson mass,"Carlo Branchina,Vincenzo Branchina,Filippo Contino,Riccardo Gandolfo,Arcangelo Pernace",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"According to usual calculations in quantum field theory, both in flat and curved spacetime, the mass $m^2$ of a scalar particle is quadratically sensitive to the ultimate scale of the theory, the UV physical cutoff $\Lambda$. In the present work, paying attention to the path integral measure and to the way $\Lambda$ is introduced, we calculate the one-loop effective action $\Gamma^{1l}$ for a scalar field on a non-trivial gravitational background. We find that $m^2$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to $\Lambda$. This is obtained without resorting to a supersymmetric embedding of the theory, nor to regularization schemes (as dimensional or zeta-function regularization) where power-like divergences are absent by construction. In view of the results of the present work, we finally speculate on the way the Minkowski limit should be approached.",
Cross submissions,Investigating $f(R)$-Inflation: background evolution and constraints,"Elisa Fazzari,Chiara De Leo,Giovanni Montani,Matteo Martinelli,Alessandro Melchiorri,Guadalupe Ca√±as-Herrera",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we investigate the possibility of generating an inflationary mechanism within the framework of a metric-$f(R)$ modified gravity theory, formulated in the Jordan frame. We explore whether the scalar field, non-minimally coupled to gravity and emerging in the Jordan frame, can play the role of the primordial inflaton. Particular attention is devoted to constructing a dynamical scenario in the Jordan frame that exhibits a slow-rolling phase for the scalar field and admits a quasi-de Sitter solution for cosmic evolution. To ensure consistency with the standard cosmological model, we impose a matching condition with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the end of the inflationary phase. Furthermore, to address the problem of the absence of matter after inflation, we consider a radiation-type particle creation process that maintains an approximately constant energy density. We test our theoretical model against background observational data, specifically Pantheon+ calibrated with SH0ES and DESI calibrated with BBN. We asses its viability and discuss implications for alleviating the Hubble constant tension.",
Cross submissions,Robustness of analogue Hawking radiation in cavities with moving boundaries,"Alberto Garc√≠a Mart√≠n-Caro,Javier Olmedo,Jose M. S√°nchez Vel√°zquez",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work we explore the limitations and robustness of thermal radiation in dynamical Casimir systems serving as analogs for Hawking radiation. Through detailed numerical analysis, we characterize particle production spectra in cavities with moving boundaries under various configurations, including expanding, collapsing, and rigidly accelerating scenarios. We find that thermal signatures emerge in specific expanding cavity configurations but are highly dependent on frequency bands and acceleration parameters. In those configurations of the cavity where there is thermal production, we derive fitting expressions that quantify deviations from idealized thermal spectra through gray-body factors, revealing oscillatory behaviors tied to acceleration duration. Our results identify which experimental setups can reliably simulate gravitationally-induced phenomena and quantify how finite-size effects and transient dynamics modify the expected thermal distributions, providing a comprehensive framework for distinguishing genuine Hawking-like radiation from experimental artifacts.",
Cross submissions,Two-loop renormalization and running of galaxy bias,"Thomas Bakx,Mathias Garny,Henrique Rubira,Zvonimir Vlah",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We systematically extend the framework of galaxy bias renormalization to two-loop order. For the minimal complete basis of 29 deterministic bias operators up to fifth order in the density field and at leading order in gradient expansion we explicitly work out one- and two-loop renormalization. The latter is provided in terms of double-hard limits of bias kernels, which we find to depend on only one function of the ratio of the loop momenta. After including stochasticity in terms of composite operator renormalization, we apply the framework to the two-loop power spectrum of biased tracers and provide a simple result suitable for numerical evaluation. In addition, we work out one- and two-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) for deterministic bias coefficients related to bias operators constructed from a smoothed density field, generalizing previous works. We identify a linear combination of bias operators with enhanced UV sensitivity, related to a positive eigenvalue of the RGE. Finally, we present an analogy with the RGE as used in quantum field theory, suggesting that a resummation of large logarithms as employed in the latter may also yield useful applications in the study of large-scale galaxy bias.",
Cross submissions,Gravity MHV amplitudes via Berends-Giele currents,"Chanon Hasuwannakit,Kirill Krasnov",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Berends and Giele derived the Parke-Taylor formula for Yang-Mills MHV amplitudes by computing Berends-Giele currents involving gluons of all-plus and all-but-one-plus helicities. Remarkably, the all-plus current already encodes much of the Parke-Taylor formula structure. The all-but-one-plus current satisfies a more intricate recursion relation than the all-plus case, but one that can still be solved explicitly. This current turns out to be proportional to the all-plus current, which explains why the essential features of the MHV formula are already present at the all-plus level.In this paper, we carry out an analogous program for gravity. The all-plus graviton Berends-Giele current satisfies a recursion relation that is more involved than in the Yang-Mills case, but whose explicit solution is known: a sum over spanning trees of the complete graph on n vertices. We derive and solve the recursion relation for the all-but-one-plus graviton current. The solution is again given by a sum over spanning trees, where each tree contributes a term proportional to the corresponding all-plus current, multiplied by a factor given by a sum over subtrees. Only a small subset of these terms contributes to the MHV amplitude, which we recover explicitly. This provides a direct derivation of the gravity MHV formula from the gravitational Feynman rules - achieving what Berends, Giele, and Kuijf in their 1987 paper regarded as ""hard to obtain directly from quantum gravity"".",
Cross submissions,Strong gravitational lensing by black hole in F(R) Euler Heisenberg Gravity's Rainbow,"Sayan Naskar,Niyaz Uddin Molla,Ujjal Debnath",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate gravitational lensing in the strong-field regime for a black hole in F(R) Euler Heisenberg Gravity with Rainbow gravity modifications. This black hole spacetime is characterized by the Euler Heisenberg parameter, F(R) parameters, Rainbow functions, the black hole charge Q, and mass M . We numerically compute the strong deflection angle and its associated coefficients, and explore their astrophysical implications for supermassive black holes in different galaxies. Our findings show that increasing the Euler Heisenberg parameter enhances key lensing observables such as the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, angular position, relative magnification, Einstein ring radius, and time delay for a fixed Q . Conversely, increasing Q decreases these parameters while keeping other quantities fixed. Additionally, a higher Euler Heisenberg parameter reduces the deflection angle and angular separation S , whereas increasing Q causes both to increase. Our study reveals that black holes in this modified gravity framework can act as strong gravitational lenses, producing deflection angles that surpass those of Reissner Nordstrom and Schwarzschild black holes under specific conditions. These results highlight the unique topological features of modified charged black holes and suggest their potential as astrophysical candidates, offering new insights into their observational signatures. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of the lensing predictions with respect to changes in the functional forms of the Rainbow functions. The combined effects of F(R) gravity, Euler Heisenberg electrodynamics, and Rainbow gravity introduce novel qualitative features not present in the individual models.",
Cross submissions,Testing Signatures of Phantom Crossing through Full-Shape Galaxy Clustering Analysis,"Emanuelly Silva,Rafael C. Nunes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\sim 5\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \sim 0.4$--$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.",
Cross submissions,Two dynamical scenarios for the binned Master sample interpretation,"Giovanni Montani,Elisa Fazzari,Nakia Carlevaro,Maria Giovanna Dainotti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze two different scenarios for the late Universe dynamics, resulting into Hubble parameters deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM, mainly for the presence of an additional free parameter, which is the dark energy parameter. The first model consists of a pure evolutionary dark energy paradigm, as result of its creation by the gravitational field of the expanding Universe. The second model also considers an interaction of the evolutionary dark energy with the matter component, postulated via the conservation of the sum of their ideal energy-momentum tensors. These two models are then compared \textit{via} the diagnostic tool of the effective running Hubble constant, with the binned data of the so-called ``Master sample'' for the Type Ia Supernovae. The comparison procedures, based on a standard MCMC analysis, led to a clear preference of data for the dark energy - matter interaction model, which is associated to a phantom matter equation of state parameter (very close to $-1$) when, being left free by data (it has a flat posterior), it is fixed in order to reproduce the decreasing power-law behavior of the effective running Hubble constant, already discussed in literature.",
Cross submissions,A spherical hydrodynamical model of cosmic voids in ŒõCDM and beyond,"Tommaso Moretti,Giovanni Verza,Noemi Frusciante,Franceso Pace",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmic voids have emerged as powerful probes for cosmology, providing complementary information on the large-scale structure of the universe. We present the first application of a hydrodynamical framework to model the evolution of cosmic voids. This approach offers a physically intuitive characterization of void dynamics and can naturally be applied to non-standard cosmologies. We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear (Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density contrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void statistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the shell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby extending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe.Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we investigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and $w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically symmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0 $, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%. Variations in $w_a$ have a smaller impact, but may still lead to measurable effects. We also show that the cosmology-dependent mapping between linear and non-linear density contrasts may provide a sensitive probe of dynamical dark energy in precision void analyses.",
Cross submissions,"On the relation between perspective-neutral, algebraic, and effective quantum reference frames","Julian De Vuyst,Philipp A. Hoehn,Artur Tsobanjan",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics. Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries, namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN) approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application, we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally, we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.",
