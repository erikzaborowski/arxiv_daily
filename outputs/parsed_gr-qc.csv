New submissions,"Dynamics of test particles, QPOs and thermodynamics of charged Euler-Heisenberg AdS black holes with a cloud of strings and dark matter","Faizuddin Ahmed,Ahmad Al-Badawi,İzzet Sakallı",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the geodesic motion of test particles around a charged Euler-Heisenberg Anti-de Sitter black hole (CEH-AdS-BH) with a cloud of strings (CoS) and surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). Our analysis examines how the interplay between Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamic corrections, string cloud, and PFDM distributions modifies fundamental BH properties. We study dynamics of both massless photons and massive neutral test particles, deriving the effective potentials and trajectory equations that govern particle motion in this exotic spacetime. The photon sphere analysis shows systematic increases in shadow radii with string cloud parameter variations, while innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) calculations demonstrate competing effects between string-induced gravitational weakening and electromagnetic charge contributions. We examine scalar and electromagnetic field perturbations using the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell equations, establishing the perturbative potentials that characterize wave propagation in the modified background. The scalar perturbative potential exhibits characteristic barrier structures influenced by all exotic matter components, while electromagnetic perturbations show fundamental differences due to their vector nature. Our thermodynamic investigation extends the conventional framework by incorporating additional intensive variables corresponding to cosmic string and perfect fluid dark matter contributions. The specific heat capacity analysis reveals divergence points that demarcate thermodynamically stable and unstable regions, while the Gibbs free energy exhibits modified profiles that extend Anti-de Sitter black hole thermodynamics into new parameter regimes.",
New submissions,Perfect fluid dark matter: a viability test with galaxy rotation curves,Jan Kuncewicz,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The anomalous rotation curves of galaxies provide compelling evidence for dark matter, yet its fundamental nature and distribution remain key unresolved issues in astrophysics. In this work, we investigate a dark matter model derived from first principles within General Relativity, treating the halo as a perfect fluid with a specific anisotropic equation of state characterized by a single parameter. This framework yields two families of static, spherically symmetric solutions: a Power-Law metric and a Logarithmic metric. As an initial viability test, we fit the model's derived circular velocity profiles to the dark matter contributions of representative galaxies from the SPARC database. Our analysis reveals that the two solutions effectively describe different regions of the halo: the Logarithmic form accurately models the large-radius behavior, while the Power-Law form successfully reproduces the inner rotation curve. Notably, the model consistently favors a shallow central density profile, aligning with cored halo models and providing a fit for galaxies with a gradual rise in velocity. We conclude that this simple, analytically-derived fluid model provides a compelling and physically-motivated framework for describing galactic rotation curves, warranting a more exhaustive study across a larger sample of galaxies.",
New submissions,New HDE models with higher derivatives of the Hubble parameter $H$,Antonio Pasqua,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we investigate two Dark Energy (DE) models characterized by higher-order derivatives of the Hubble parameter $H$, which generalize previously proposed DE scenarios. Assuming a power-law form of the scale factor $a(t)$ given by $a(t)=b_0t^n$, we derive analytical expressions for the DE energy density, pressure, the Equation of State (EoS) parameter, the deceleration parameter and the evolutionary form of the fractional DE density. Both non-interacting and interacting dark sector frameworks are examined, with the interaction modeled through a coupling term proportional to the Dark Matter (DM) energy density. For specific parameter sets corresponding to power-law indices $n=2$, $n=3$, and $n=4$, we compute the present age of the Universe. The obtained values deviate from the observationally inferred age of $\approx 13.8$ Gyr; however, a systematic trend is identified, with larger $n$ leading to higher ages. Furthermore, interacting scenarios consistently predict larger ages compared to their non-interacting counterparts. These results highlight the phenomenological viability and limitations of higher-derivative DE models in describing the cosmic evolution.",
New submissions,Past and future isotropization in $f(R)$ dark energy models,"Adnaan Nauthoo,Peter Dunsby,Álvaro de la Cruz-Dombriz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We perform the dynamical system analysis for the homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi I cosmology in the context of Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity with parameters $\{n,C_{1}\}=\{1,1\}$. Deriving the corresponding four-dimensional dynamical system from the field equations allows us to find the fixed points of the system in both the vacuum and matter cases alongside their stability. This approach also provides analytical expressions for both the cosmic expansion and shear of each fixed point. We show that, for the chosen parameters, Hu-Sawicki gravity allows for isotropization both in the past and in the future for both vacuum and matter. For the matter case, the analysis was subdivided into the dust, radiation and cosmological constant cases, and we show that all three cases exhibit past and future isotropization. The obtained results also revealed interesting aspects of the phase space such as the existence and phenomenology of lines and two-dimensional sheets of fixed points.",
New submissions,On the fate of spacetime singularities,Federico Piazza,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"I investigate spacetime singularities from the point of view of the wavefunction of the universe. In order to extend the classical notion of geodesic incompleteness one has to include the proper time of an observer as a degree of freedom in the Wheeler DeWitt equation. This leads to a Schrödinger equation along the observer worldline. Near the singularity, as in the classical BLK treatment, I ignore spatial gradients and effectively describe the spacetime around the worldline in the mini-superspace approximation. The problem proves identical to a spherically symmetric scattering of a quantum particle off a central potential and singularity avoidance is tantamount to the unitary evolution of this system. Standard types of matter (dust, radiation) correspond to regular potentials and thus lead to a bounce. The most singular component, spatial anisotropy, is associated to a conserved charge and yields a negative inverse-square potential-like standard angular momentum, but with opposite sign. This potential is critical, in that the unitarity of the evolution depends on the actual numerical factor in front of it, i.e., on the anisotropy charge.",
New submissions,Radial Oscillations of Viscous Neutron Stars: Zero Diffusion Case,"Raissa F. P. Mendes,Amanda Guerrieri,João V. M. Muniz,Gabriel S. Rocha,Gabriel S. Denicol",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"The spectrum of radial oscillations of neutron stars is systematically studied within two frameworks of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics: the relativistic Navier-Stokes and Israel-Stewart theories. A correspondence is established between the discrete stellar eigenmodes and the continuous dispersion relation of perturbations around a homogeneous fluid, providing a basis for interpreting our numerical results. We analyze the Newtonian limit and assess the impact of relativistic corrections, such as the gravitational redshifting of microscopic relaxation timescales. We show that bulk viscosity can significantly affect the behavior of both hydrodynamic and nonhydrodynamic fundamental modes, and that, depending on the magnitude of the viscous effects, it is the nonhydrodynamic mode that becomes unstable beyond the turning point in a sequence of equilibrium configurations. These results provide a useful step toward systematic studies of neutron star quasinormal modes in the presence of viscosity.",
New submissions,Distorted black ring with rotation on the two-sphere,"Matin Tavayef,Shohreh Abdolrahimi,Ivan Booth,Hari Kunduri",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),We construct a stationary black ring spacetime with rotation only along the $S^2$ direction that is free of conical singularities. We use a solution-generating technique to add external gravitational fields and show these can be used to remove conical singularities from an asymptotically flat black ring with a rotating $S^2$.,
New submissions,On the non-zero Love numbers of magnetic black holes,"David Pereñiguez,Edgars Karnickis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Black holes are believed to possess vanishing Love numbers, which implies that they do not deform in the presence of external tides. This fact has been verified in a number of scenarios, that involve tides of bosonic fields of various natures (e.g. scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational), and has triggered active research in trying to identify the underlying reason. Surprisingly, two counterexamples have been found recently. The first, concerns charged-field tides on electrically-charged black holes. In that case, however, the response cannot be disentangled from dissipative effects, and might thus be argued to not consist of a truly conservative deformation. The second concerns fermionic tides on neutral holes. While these yield a purely conservative response, they lack a classical interpretation, which is the physical regime where black hole deformability is understood. Here, we consider magnetic Reissner-Nordstrom black holes and show that electrically-charged, scalar-field tides induce non-vanishing tidal Love numbers. We prove that this is a purely non-dissipative effect, in contrast to the cases of rotating or electrically-charged black holes, and hence consists of a genuine deformation. In addition, the magnetic charge resolves common ambiguities in defining Love numbers, so our result does not rely on any regularisation scheme. This constitutes a clear realisation of how new physics can influence black hole tidal deformability, and offers new perspectives on the study of black hole Love numbers.",
New submissions,Examining the influence of anisotropy on the fundamental mode of nonradial oscillation in quark stars on a complete general relativistic scheme,"José D. V. Arbañil,Gabriel O. Cavalheiro,Victor B. T. Alves,Juan M. Z. Pretel,César O. V. Flores,César H. Lenzi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The anisotropic influence on the $f$-mode frequency of oscillations and dimensionless tidal deformability of strange quark matter are analyzed by employing the nonradial oscillation equations for the complete general relativity frame and tidal deformability equations, which are derived and modified from their standard form to introduce the anisotropic factor. The fluid in the compact star follows the MIT bag model with vector coupling. For the anisotropic function, we use a local anisotropy, which is regular along the whole star and is null both at the center and on the star's surface. We show that the $f$-frequency of oscillation and dimensionless tidal deformability change considerably with the anisotropy. Finally, we investigate the correlation between the dimensionless tidal deformability of the GW$170817$ event with the anisotropy.",
New submissions,"Regular Black Holes from Proper-Time flow in Quantum Gravity and their Quasinormal modes, Shadow and Hawking radiation","Alfio Bonanno,Roman A. Konoplya,Giovanni Oglialoro,Andrea Spina",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We derive a class of regular black holes from the proper-time renormalization group approach to asymptotically safe gravity. A central challenge is the robustness of physical predictions to the regularization scheme. We address this by computing key observables for our quantum-corrected black holes, which are non-singular and asymptotically Schwarzschild. We calculate the quasinormal mode spectrum, finding significant deviations from the classical case. The Hawking radiation spectrum is strongly suppressed, implying a slower evaporation rate and relaxed constraints on primordial black holes as dark matter. Shadows and ISCO radii remain consistent with observations. Our results demonstrate that the singularity resolution and its primary observational implications are robust physical outcomes.",
New submissions,Generalized Lemaître time for rotating and charged black holes and its near-horizon properties,"A. V. Toporensky,O. B. Zaslavskii",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider the behavior of the analogue of the Lemaitre time when a particle approaches the horizon of a rotating black hole. For the Kerr metric, the aforementioned time coincides with the Doran or Natario time but we consider a more general class of metrics. We scrutiny relationship between (i) its finiteness or divergence, (ii) the forward-in-time condition, (iii) the sign of a generalized momentum/energy, (iv) the validity of the principle of kinematic censorship. The latter notion means impossibility to release in any event an energy which is literally infinite. As a consequence, we obtain a new explanation, why collisions of two particles inside the horizon do not lead to infinite energy in their center of mass frame. The same results are also obtained for the Reissner-Nordström metric",
New submissions,Quantum Dynamics of a Scalar Particle in Schwarzschild Spacetime using the Generalized Feshbach Villars Transformation,"Sarra Garah,Abdelmalek Boumali",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we apply the generalised Feshbach Villars transformation (GFVT) to spin-0 scalar fields in a Schwarzschild gravitational background. Starting from the covariant Klein Gordon equation, we reformulate the dynamics in the FV two-component representation, which enables a natural separation of positive- and negative-energy branches. In the far-field approximation, the system exhibits a hydrogen like bound spectrum, confirming the ability of GFVT to provide a consistent probabilistic interpretation in curved spacetime. We then extend the formalism by introducing a relativistic harmonic oscillator potential, which transforms the radial equation into a biconfluent Heun form. The requirement of square integrability leads to a discrete oscillator spectrum that remains independent of the gravitational parameter, with gravity appearing only through selection rules on the admissible quantum states. Explicit wave functions, probability densities, and graphical results are presented, illustrating the internal consistency of the method. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of GFVT as a bridge between relativistic quantum mechanics and curved geometry, and it highlights its potential for future applications in strong gravitational fields.",
New submissions,Near-horizon polarized images of rotating hairy Horndeski black holes,"Chekiang Chen,Qiyuan Pan,Jiliang Jing",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recently, Hou et al. [Astrophys. J. Lett. 988, L51 (2025)] revealed that the EVPA (Electric Vector Position Angle) of polarization vectors in the near-horizon images is governed solely by spacetime geometry and is irrespective of the plasma flows. Here, we generalize the study to the scenario of a rotating hair black hole within Horndeski gravity and probe the effects of the hairy parameter on the EVPA. For a fixed inclination, the hairy parameter enhances the observed EVPA in the slowly rotating case, but decreases it in the rapidly rotating case. For a fixed black hole spin, the influence of the hairy parameter on the observed EVPA under different observer inclinations is further modulated by the azimuthal angle of the observed polarization vector. The hairy parameter's impact is more distinct in the low inclination case as the azimuthal angle lies within a specific range, but is almost independent of the observer inclination as the azimuthal angle is beyond this specific range. Furthermore, the dependence of the hairy parameter's impact on the EVPA is stronger with respect to the black hole spin than to the inclination angle. These results could help to further understand the near-horizon polarized images and Horndeski gravity.",
New submissions,Random Forest Classification of MBTA Gravitational-Wave Triggers for Low-Latency Detection,"Lorenzo Mobilia,Gianluca Maria Guidi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"In this work, we explore a possible application of a machine learning classifier for candidate events in a template-based search for gravitational-wave (GW) signals from various compact system sources. We analyze data from the O3a and O3b data acquisition campaign, during which the sensitivity of ground-based detectors is limited by real non-Gaussian noise transient. The state-of-the-art searches for such signals tipically rely on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a chi-square test to assess the consistency of the signal with an inspiral template. In addition, a combination of these and other statistical properties are used to build a 're-weighted SNR' statistics. We evaluate a Random Forest classifiers on a set of double-coincidence events identified using the MBTA pipeline. The new classifier achieves a modest but consistent increase in event detection at low false positive rates relative to the standard search. Using the output statistics from the Random Forest classifier, we compute the probability of astrophysical origin for each event, denoted as $p_\mathrm{astro}$. This is then evaluated for the events listed in existing catalogs, with results consistent with those from the standard search. Finally, we search for new possible candidates using this new statistics, with $p_\mathrm{astro} > 0.5$, obtaining a new subthreshold candidate (IFAR =0.05) event at $gps: 1240423628$ .",
New submissions,Quantum Computing Tools for Fast Detection of Gravitational Waves in the Context of LISA Space Mission,"Maria-Catalina Isfan,Laurentiu-Ioan Caramete,Ana Caramete,Daniel Tonoiu,Alexandru Nicolin-Zaczek","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)","The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.",
New submissions,Properties of a deformed Myers-Perry black hole,"Shohreh Abdolrahimi,Matin Tavayef",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Considering an exact solution of the five-dimensional Einstein equations in vacuum space, which represents a distorted Myers-Perry black hole with a single angular momentum, we investigate how the distortion affects the horizon surface of this black hole. We illustrate a special case where we have a bumpy deformed black hole horizon that feels the presence of the external sources. However, the ergosphere is oblivious to the presence of external sources.",
New submissions,Classical and quantum aspects of perturbations in Primordial Universe,Alice Boldrin,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, our aim is to obtain a Hamiltonian formulation suitable for canonical quantization. Moreover, we assume that the early Universe can be described with fewer initial symmetries, thus we abandon the isotropy assumption and instead explore anisotropic universes, beginning with the simplest one, namely Bianchi I (BI). The presence of small initial fluctuations in the early universe can be well described by perturbations around a homogeneous background. GR is a constrained system, and we apply the so-called Dirac procedure for constrained systems to derive a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian formulation suitable for quantization. In this work, we present how this procedure can be extended to a generic background and its relation to the Kuchar decomposition. Subsequently, we apply this formulation to a BI universe, obtaining new and interesting results on the gauge-invariant representation of matter and geometry perturbations. Contrary to the FLRW case, in which all the modes decouple, in BI we see that scalar and tensor modes do not decouple. We show that new types of gauge-fixing conditions exit in this case. For instance, a gravitational wave can be encoded into scalar modes, by introducing a new gauge which is not valid in FLRW. Furthermore, we make a first step towards a consistent and unified quantization of the composite system made of a background mode and perturbation modes. Specifically, we study tensor modes in a FLRW universe. We focus on the relation between the choice of internal time of the universe and the quantum evolution it undergoes. Our results indicate that the time reparametrization invariance in general relativity affects the quantum evolution of the background and perturbation modes. However, in the classical limit, i.e. for a large universe, the dynamics becomes unique. Thus, the predictive power of the theory is maintained.",
New submissions,Exact solutions of Maxwell vacuum equations in Petrov homogeneous non-null spaces,V.V. Obukhov,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The classification of exact solutions of Maxwell vacuum equations for pseudo-Riemannian spaces with spatial symmetry (homogeneous non-null spaces of Petrov) in the presence of electromagnetic fields invariant with respect to the action of the group of space motions is summarized. A new classification method is used, common to all homogeneous zero spaces of Petrov. The method is based on the use of canonical reper vectors and a on the use a new approach to the systematization of solutions. The classification results are presented in a form more convenient for further use. Using the previously made refinement of the classification of Petrov spaces, the classification of exact solutions of Maxwell vacuum equations for spaces with the group of motions $G_3(VIII )$ is completed.",
New submissions,Rotating Extremal Black Holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld Theory,"Tomáš Hale,Robie A. Hennigar,David Kubizňák",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We construct exact solutions that describe the near horizon region of extremal rotating black holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld theory. Using generalized Komar integrals, we extract the electric charge and angular momentum from the near horizon geometries and study their deviations from the Kerr-Newman solution. We identify two features that are direct consequences of the nonlinearities of Born-Infeld theory. First, we find solutions which have vanishing charge but nontrivial electric and magnetic fields. Second, we find that extremal rotating black holes do not exist for sufficiently small charge and angular momentum. Based on analogy with the static black holes, we argue that it would be particularly interesting to construct the full rotating solutions in these parameter regions as they may provide examples of rotating black holes without Cauchy horizons.",
New submissions,Rotating neutron stars within the macroscopic effective-surface approximation,"A.G. Magner,S.P.Maydanyuk,A. Bonasera,H. Zheng,S.N. Fedotkin,A.I. Levon,T. Depastas,U.V. Grygoriev,A.A. Uleiev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at the equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega$ within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The NS angular momentum $I$ and moment of inertia (MI) for a slow stationary azimuthal rotation around the symmetry axis is calculated by using the Kerr metric approach in the Boyer-Lindquist and Hogan forms for the perfect liquid-drop model of NSs. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R \ll 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum $I$ at small frequencies $\omega$, up to quadratic terms, can be specified for calculations of the adiabatic MI, $\Theta=d I/d \omega$, by using Hogan's inner gravitational metric, $r\le R$. The NS MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal angle correlation, $\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sumes of the volume and surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of a strong gravitation. We found the significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius $R_{\rm S}$ to a much smaller position due to the time and azimuthal correlation term $\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi}$. The adiabaticity condition is carried out for several neutron stars in a strong gravitation case.",
New submissions,Asymptotic Velocity Domination in quantized polarized Gowdy Cosmologies,"Max Niedermaier,Mahdi Sedighi Jafari",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Asymptotic velocity domination (AVD) posits that when back-propagated to the Big Bang generic cosmological spacetimes solve a drastically simplified version of the Einstein field equations, where all dynamical spatial gradients are absent (similar as in the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario). Conversely, a solution can in principle be reconstructed from its behavior near the Big Bang. This property has been rigorously proven for the Gowdy class of cosmologies, both polarized and unpolarized. Here we establish for the polarized case a quantum version of the AVD property formulated in terms of two-point functions of (the integrands of) Dirac observables: these correlators approach their much simpler velocity dominated counterparts when the time support is back-propagated to the Big Bang. Conversely, the full correlators can be expressed as a uniformly convergent series in averaged spatial gradients of the velocity dominated ones.",
New submissions,Short-Duration Gravitational Wave Burst Detection using Convolutional Neural Network,"Matteo Pracchia,Sacha Peters,Maxime Fays",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Detecting unmodeled gravitational wave (GW) bursts presents significant challenges due to the lack of accurate waveform templates required for matched-filtering techniques. A primary difficulty lies in distinguishing genuine signals from transient noise. Machine learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer promising alternatives for this classification problem. This paper presents a CNN-based pipeline for detecting short GW bursts (duration $< 10~\mathrm{s}$), adapted from an existing framework designed for longer-duration events. The CNN has been trained on core-collapse supernova (CCSN) gravitational waveform models injected into simulated Gaussian noise. The network successfully identifies these signals and generalizes to CCSN waveforms not included in the training set, showing the potential of U-Net architectures for detecting short-duration gravitational wave transients across diverse astrophysical scenarios.",
New submissions,Towards detecting the time perturbations from GWs in asynchronous gauges,"Stefano Bondani,Sergio Luigi Cacciatori",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The experimental possibility of detecting gravitational waves via their induced time perturbations is explored here, expanding from previous work. The oscillations of the time-time component in the metric are made explicit when working in asynchronous gauges: the desynchronization between a perturbed clock and a reference unperturbed clock constitutes the corresponding observable core target of a detector. To this end we explore the experimental techniques currently available for a preliminary assessment towards a feasibility study. We survey the state of the art in the fields of high precision timing and information preservation, necessary for achieving geodesic non-locality. A synthesis for a feasible prototype detector with the desired characteristics is presented. The optimum point between existing technologies is found around the 1 Hz frequency band, opening the window for the observation of classes of speculated sources of gravitational radiation such as intermediate mass black hole binaries.",
Cross submissions,Consistent Four-derivative Heterotic Truncations and the Kerr-Sen Solution,"Liang Ma,Yi Pang,Robert J. Saskowski,Minghao Xia",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a $p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a $(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other, and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.",
Cross submissions,Dust Attenuation of Lyman-Werner Feedback: Reassessing Early Super Massive Black Holes Seed Formation,Bisweswar Sen,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation at high redshift. Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.",
Cross submissions,Bumblebee vector-tensor dark energy,"Carsten van de Bruck,Mohammad Ali Gorji,Nils A. Nilsson,Masahide Yamaguchi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Bumblebee models, a class of vector-tensor theories in which a vector field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks spacetime symmetries, are ubiquitous in the literature. In this paper, we highlight several often-overlooked properties of these models by analyzing their cosmological perturbations. We show that a non-minimal coupling to gravity is essential for the stability of the setup. However, avoiding propagation of a ghost mode then requires imposing a relation between the coupling coefficients, known as the degeneracy condition, which reduces the bumblebee model to a subset of generalized Proca theories with a marginal non-minimal operator. By imposing the degeneracy condition, the vector field becomes non-dynamical at the background level, and the form of its potential is completely fixed in vacuum. We show that the vacuum expectation value of the vector field can drive a de Sitter solution, for which the effects of the non-minimal coupling are negligible at the background level but provide essential order-one corrections to the sound speed of the scalar mode, keeping the setup weakly coupled at the level of perturbations. Treating this stealth de Sitter solution as a dark energy candidate, we study its coupling to matter and find the effective gravitational coupling for the matter density contrast in the quasi-static regime. At the level of perturbations, the system behaves differently from $\Lambda$CDM, providing a potential observational signature to distinguish the two models.",
Cross submissions,Systematic Effects of Chaotic Magnetic Fields on Neutron Star Tidal Deformability: Implications for Gravitational Wave Constraints on Dense Matter,Debarshi Mukherjee,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the effects of strong magnetic fields on the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star matter and the resulting implications for tidal deformability measurements in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. A critical issue with previous magnetized neutron star studies is the treatment of magnetic field anisotropy in the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. To address this fundamental problem, we employ the chaotic magnetic field approximation, which allows for a self-consistent treatment of magnetic pressure while maintaining isotropy. Using a relativistic mean field approach with properly implemented magnetic field corrections, we compute mass-radius relations and tidal deformability parameters for neutron stars with magnetic field strengths ranging from $10^{15}$ to $10^{16}$ G. Our systematic study reveals that magnetic fields induce increases in both stellar radii (0.8--2.3\%) and tidal deformabilities (4.2--18.1\%) compared to field-free cases, with effects scaling approximately as $B^{1/2}$. These modifications, while modest, are potentially detectable with current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors. For a canonical $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star, the tidal deformability increases from $\Lambda_{1.4} = 678 \times 10^6$ in the absence of magnetic fields to $\Lambda_{1.4} = 803 \times 10^6$ for $B = 10^{16}$ G. We demonstrate that magnetic field effects must be considered when constraining the neutron star equation of state using gravitational wave observations, particularly for populations including highly magnetized neutron stars. Our results suggest that the current GW170817 constraint on tidal deformability may require systematic corrections when accounting for magnetic field effects. We provide scaling relations for magnetic field corrections and discuss the implications for population studies of neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors.",
Cross submissions,Trombone gaugings of five-dimensional maximal supergravity,Oscar Varela,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"The maximal gauged supergravities in five spacetime dimensions with gauge groups contained in $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are described. The $\textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ factor is the duality group of ungauged maximal supergravity and $\mathbb{R}^+$ is the scaling symmetry of the five-dimensional metric, usually called the \textit{trombone} symmetry. The equations of motion and supersymmetry variations for these supergravities are given to lowest order in fermions, and the mass matrices are provided. Then, the theories with gauge groups contained in a maximal subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are classified, and a new family of such supergravities uncovered. For a concrete theory in this class, some supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua are found and their mass spectra computed within the gauged supergravity. These vacua are argued to be related to superconformal phases of the M5-brane field theory.",
Cross submissions,On the (Im)possibility of Electrically Charged Planck Relics,Stefano Profumo,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"I revisit whether black-hole remnants, from sub-Planckian compact objects to Planck relics and up to (super)massive black holes, can preserve Standard-Model (SM) electric charge. Two exterior-field mechanisms -- Coulomb-focused capture from ambient media and QED Schwinger pair production -- robustly neutralize such objects across cosmic history. I first derive the general capture rate including both Coulomb and gravitational focusing, and sum the stepwise discharge time in closed form via the trigamma function, exhibiting transparent Coulomb- and gravity-dominated limits. I then integrate the Schwinger rate over the near-horizon region to obtain an explicit $\dot Q(Q)$ law: discharge proceeds until the horizon field falls below $E_{\rm crit}$, leaving a residual charge $Q_{\rm stop}^{(e)}\!\propto\! r_h^2$ that is $\ll e$ for Planck radii. Mapping the mass dependence from sub-Planckian to astrophysical scales, I also analyze dark-sector charges with heavy carriers (including kinetic mixing and massive mediators). In a conservative ``no-Schwinger'' limit where vacuum pair creation is absent, cumulative ambient exposures alone force discharge of any integer SM charge. Three possible loopholes remain. (i) A fine-tuned SM corner in which the relic sits arbitrarily close to Reissner-Nordström extremality so greybody factors suppress charged absorption, while Schwinger pair creation is absent due to Planck-scale physics. (ii) Charge relocated to a hidden $U(1)_D$ with no light opposite carriers, e.g. if the lightest state is very heavy and/or kinetic mixing with $U(1)_{\rm EM}$ is vanishingly small. (iii) Discrete or topological charges rather than ordinary SM electric charge. Outside these cases, the conclusion is robust: within SM electromagnetism, charged black-hole relics neutralize efficiently and cannot retain charge over cosmological times.",
Cross submissions,Superluminal Liouville walls in 2d String Theory and space-like singularities,"Sumit R. Das,Shaun D. Hampton,Sinong Liu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"An interesting class of time dependent backgrounds in $1+1$ dimensional string theory involves worldsheet Liouville walls which move in (target space) time. When a parameter in such a background exceeds a certain critical value, the speed of the Liouville wall exceeds the speed of light, and there is no usual S-Matrix. We examine such backgrounds in the dual $c=1$ matrix model from the point of view of fluctuations of the collective field, and determine the nature of the emergent space-time perceived by these fluctuations. We show that so long as the corresponding Liouville wall remains time-like, the emergent space time is conformal to full Minkowski space with a time-like wall. However, for the cases where the Liouville wall is superluminal, the emergent space-time has a {\em space-like boundary} where the collective field couplings diverge. This appears as a space-like singularity in perturbative collective field theory. We comment on the necessity of incorporating finite $N$, as well as finite (double-scaled) coupling, effects to understand the behavior of the exact theory near this boundary.",
Cross submissions,Entanglement Entropy in Jackiw-Teitelboim de Sitter gravity with Timelike Boundaries,Timofei Rusalev,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The consideration of timelike boundaries in de Sitter static patches has a broad motivation, such as the formulation of a well-defined canonical ensemble and the realization of a natural framework for static patch holography. In this work we study Jackiw-Teitelboim de Sitter gravity with symmetric timelike reflecting boundaries, which, in the presence of both cosmological and ""black hole"" horizons, naturally separate the spacetime into a ""black hole system"" and a ""cosmological system"". We apply the island formula to compute the entanglement entropy of conformal matter in both systems. In the ""black hole system"" an island appears, causing the entanglement entropy to saturate at the horizon value and preventing late-time growth. In the ""cosmological system"" no island appears, and the entanglement entropy can become arbitrarily large depending on the position of the boundaries, indicating a tension with unitarity.",
Cross submissions,Probing the millisecond pulsar origin of the GeV excess in the Galactic Centre with LISA,"Valeriya Korol,Andrei Igoshev",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The GeV $\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic Centre remains unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading interpretation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars has not been ruled out. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge.We construct synthetic populations of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Nevertheless, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\sim$0.9 M$_\odot$).LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Distinguishing millisecond pulsar binaries from the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, though LISA detections could provide valuable targets for follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array, enabling a critical test of the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\gamma$-ray excess.",
Cross submissions,Reconstruction of the Equations of State (EoSs) of Compact Stars using machine and deep learning regression techniques,Ioannis Stergakis,Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This dissertation focuses on the reconstruction of Equations of State (EoSs) describing the interior of compact stars, using modern machine learning and deep learning methods. The pipeline is based on data from mass-radius (M-R) curves, obtained by numerically solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for a wide range of admissible EoSs. The manuscript is divided into a Theoretical Part (Chs. 1-4) and a Computational Part (Chs. 5-7). The theoretical chapters analyze the properties of neutron and quark stars, the physical constraints of viable EoS models, and introduce regression algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) and neural networks with normalization and dropout techniques. The computational part presents the generation of artificial EoSs for hadronic and quark stars (MIT bag, CFL), the numerical solution of the TOV equations, data preparation, and hyperparameter tuning. Results include training and evaluation of models using MSE/MSLE metrics, learning curves for neural networks, and reconstruction of 21 hadronic and 20 quark star EoSs. Source code and tools for reproducibility and future research are provided. The work aims to establish a reusable and scalable framework, strengthening the connection between theoretical astrophysics and computational science.",
Cross submissions,Smallness of neutrino masses and leptogenesis in 331 composite Higgs model,Roman Nevzorov,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry down to SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that an approximate discrete Z_2 symmetry may give rise to tiny masses of the left-handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.",
Cross submissions,Comparing Minimal and Non-Minimal Quintessence Models to 2025 DESI Data,"Husam Adam,Mark P. Hertzberg,Daniel Jiménez-Aguilar,Iman Khan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we examine the 2025 DESI analysis of dark energy, which suggests that dark energy is evolving in time with an increasing equation of state $w$. We explore a wide range of quintessence models, described by a potential function $V(\varphi)$, including: quadratic potentials, quartic hilltops, double wells, cosine functions, Gaussians, inverse powers. We find that while some provide improvement in fitting to the data, compared to a cosmological constant, the improvement is only modest. We then consider non-minimally coupled scalars which can help fit the data by providing an effective equation of state that temporarily obeys $w<-1$ and then relaxes to $w>-1$. Since the scalar is very light, this leads to a fifth force and to time evolution in the effective gravitational strength, which are both tightly constrained by tests of gravity. For a very narrow range of carefully selected non-minimal couplings we are able to evade these bounds, but not for generic values.",
