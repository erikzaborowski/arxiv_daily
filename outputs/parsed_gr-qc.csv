New submissions,Exploring the gauge flexibility of the linear-in-spin effective-one-body Hamiltonian at the 5.5 post-Newtonian order,"Andrea Placidi,Luca Sebastiani,Gianluca Grignani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We derive the gauge-general expressions of the two gyro-gravitomagnetic functions entering the spin-orbit sector of the effective-one-body (EOB) Hamiltonian up to the fifth-and-half post-Newtonian (5.5PN) order. Our results include both local and nonlocal-in-time contributions, providing the most general analytical formulation of the linear-in-spin conservative dynamics within the EOB framework. These expressions are then employed to compute two gauge-invariant observables for quasi-circular orbits: the binding energy and the fractional periastron advance. We also use them to compare two spin-gauge choices: the well-known Damour-Jaranowski-Schäfer ($\rm DJS$) gauge, in which the gyro-gravitomagnetic functions are independent of the orbital angular momentum, and the alternative anti-$\rm DJS$ (or $\overline{\rm DJS}$) gauge, designed to reproduce in the test-mass limit the spin-orbit interaction of a spinning test particle in a Kerr background. For a circular, equal-mass, equal-spin binary, our analysis indicates that the $\overline{\rm DJS}$ gauge provides a slightly improved description of the inspiral dynamics, suggesting potential advantages for its use in future EOB waveform models.",
New submissions,LISA as a probe of pre-big-bang physics: a nested sampling analysis,"Xoán Vilas Currás,Gianluca Calcagni",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Using a nested sampling analysis, we study the gravitational-wave background (GWB) predicted by pre-big-bang cosmology, both in its minimal and non-minimal version. Within the LISA sensitivity range, the GWB signal is a flat or a broken power law, parametrized by four fundamental quantities: the Hubble parameter at the curvature bounce $H_1$, the axion mass $m$, the initial amplitude of the axion field $\sigma_i$ and the exponent $\beta$ governing the high-energy growth of the dilaton and the dynamics of the internal dimensions. We determine the posterior distributions of these parameters based on how LISA would detect such signal. Including the galactic and extra-galactic foregrounds in the analysis, the most stringent constraints on $H_1$, $\sigma_i$ and $\beta$ are obtained when the signal exhibits a left-bend feature, while for $m$ this happens for a right-bend feature. Relative uncertainties reach $\Delta H_1/H_1 ,\,\Delta m/m \sim 18\%$ at $68\%$ confidence level under favourable conditions. LISA will thus be capable of placing significant constraints on the pre-big-bang model, potentially providing empirical hints of string theory in the case of detection.",
New submissions,Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation,"Johor D. Peñalba Quispitupa,Guillermo F. Quispe Peña,Jose T. Galvez Ghersi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.",
New submissions,All-sky search for continuous gravitational-wave signals from unknown neutron stars in binary systems in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run,"TheLIGO Scientific Collaboration, theVirgo Collaboration, theKAGRA Collaboration",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present the results of a blind all-sky search for continuous gravitational-wave signals from neutron stars in binary systems using data from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) using LIGO detectors data. Rapidly rotating, non-axisymmetric neutron stars are expected to emit continuous gravitational waves, whose detection would significantly improve our understanding of the galactic neutron star population and matter under extreme conditions, while also providing valuable tests of general relativity. Neutron stars in binary systems likely constitute a substantial fraction of the unobserved galactic population and, due to potential mass accretion, may emit stronger gravitational-wave signals than their isolated counterparts. This search targets signals from neutron stars with frequencies in the 100-350 Hz range, with orbital periods between 7 and 15 days and projected semi-major axes between 5 and 15 light-seconds. The analysis employs the GPU-accelerated fasttracks pipeline. No credible astrophysical signals were identified, and, in the absence of a detection, we report search sensitivity estimates on the population of neutron stars in binary systems in the Milky Way.",
New submissions,Accelerating parameter estimation for parameterized tests of general relativity with gravitational-wave observations,"Dhruv Kumar,Ish Gupta,Bangalore Sathyaprakash",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Tests of general relativity (GR) with gravitational waves (GWs) introduce additional deviation parameters in the waveform model. The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\% credibility and in agreement with previous results. Across analyses, the method reduces wall time by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ to $\mathcal{O}(100)$, depending on frequency range and binning, without degrading parameter estimation accuracy.",
New submissions,Exceptional line and pseudospectrum in black hole spectroscopy,"Li-Ming Cao,Ming-Fei Ji,Liang-Bi Wu,Yu-Sen Zhou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We investigate the exceptional points (EPs) and their pseudospectra in black hole perturbation theory. By considering a Gaussian bump modification to the Regge-Wheeler potential with variable amplitude, position, and width parameters, $(\varepsilon,d,\sigma_0)$, a continuous line of EPs (exceptional line, EL) in this three-dimensional parameter space is revealed. We find that the vorticity $\nu=\pm1/2$ and the Berry phase $\gamma=\pi$ for loops encircling the EL, while $\nu=0$ and $\gamma=0$ for those do not encircle the EL. Through matrix perturbation theory, we prove that the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum contour size scales as $\epsilon^{1/q}$ at an EP, where $q$ is the order of the largest Jordan block of the Hamiltonian-like operator, contrasting with the linear $\epsilon$ scaling at non-EPs. Numerical implements confirm this observation, demonstrating enhanced spectral instability at EPs for non-Hermitian systems including black holes.",
New submissions,The Two-Measure Theory and an Overview of Some of its Manifestations,Alexander B. Kaganovich,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Two-Measure theory (TMT) has been developing since 1998 and has yielded a number of highly interesting results, including those not realized in traditional field theory models. The most important advantage of TMT as an alternative theory is that, under the conditions under which all classical tests of general relativity are performed, TMT models are able to accurately reproduce Einstein's general relativity. Despite this, TMT is still often perceived as something too exotic to be relevant to reality. In fact, the fundamental idea underlying TMT seems undeniable: if we truly believe in the effectiveness of mathematics in studying nature, we must agree that there must be a correspondence between the fundamental laws of nature and the structure of the mathematical apparatus necessary to adequately describe them. It then turns out that there is no reason to ignore the volume measure existing on the differentiable manifold on which the theory of gravity and matter fields is built. This idea has far-reaching implications. The goals of this paper are: 1) to provide a clear mathematical and conceptual justification for TMT; 2) to collect in a single article some of the main results of TMT obtained over the past 25 years.",
New submissions,Cosmological perturbations on an averaged background,"Marco Galoppo,Pierre Mourier",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In relativistic cosmology, the formation of nonlinear inhomogeneities can induce non-negligible backreaction on late-time expansion. Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables.",
New submissions,Emergence of critical phenomena from the black hole interior,"Caiying Shao,Junqi Guo,Yu Tian,Hongbao Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The emergence of the $r=0$ singularity inside a spherically symmetric charged black hole, is studied numerically within the Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar model. When the scalar field reaches a critical strength, the $r=0$ singularity emerges inside of the black hole at the tip of the causal diamond. By varying the parameter $p$ of the initial profile for the scalar field towards the critical value ${p_*}$, we observe the areal radius at the tip follows a power law scaling, ${r_S } \propto {| {p - {p_*}}|^\gamma }$, with a universal critical exponent $\gamma\approx 0.5$. This remarkable discovery, analogous to Choptuik's critical phenomena for the black hole formation, provides the first evidence of the universality and scaling for the emergence of the $r=0$ singularity inside black holes, offering new insights into the nonlinear dynamics of strong gravitational field.",
New submissions,Implications of GW241011 for rotating exotic compact objects,"N. V. Krishnendu,Tamara Evstafyeva,Aditya Vijaykumar,William E. East,Rimo Das,Sayantani Datta,Nils Siemonsen,Nami Uchikata,Poulami Dutta Roy,Anuradha Gupta,Ish Gupta,Syed U. Naqvi,Manuel Piarulli,Muhammed Saleem,Elise M. Sänger,Pratyusava Baral,Sajad A. Bhat,Thomas A. Callister,Mattia Emma,Carl-Johan Haster",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A number of theoretical proposals have been made for horizonless compact objects with masses and spins similar to those of black holes. While gravitational wave signatures from their mergers can resemble those of black holes, features like the spin-induced quadrupole moment may reveal their distinct nature. Using the tight bounds on the spin-induced quadrupole moment of GW241011, we place gravitational wave constraints on the nature of its primary. We find that large classes of exotic compact objects (including rotating boson stars) cannot explain its nature, however, models of sufficiently large compactness of $C \gtrsim 0.24$ may still be viable contenders.",
New submissions,Entanglement and correlations between local observables in de Sitter spacetime,"Patricia Ribes-Metidieri,Ivan Agullo,Béatrice Bonga",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Studies of quantum field entanglement in de Sitter space based on the von Neumann entropy of local patches have concluded that curvature enhances entanglement between regions and their complements. Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local approach: examining entanglement between pairs of field modes compactly supported within de Sitter's cosmological patch. Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure. We show that our results are compatible with previous entropy-based studies when properly interpreted. Our findings have implications for entanglement between observables generated during cosmic inflation.",
New submissions,A battle of designs: triangular vs. L-shaped detectors and parity violation in the gravitational-wave background,"Hannah Duval,Charles Badger,Mairi Sakellariadou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the prospects for detecting a parity-violating gravitational-wave background (GWB) with third-generation ground-based detector networks. We focus on a network consisting of one Einstein Telescope (ET) and two Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. In our analysis we vary the ET design, detector orientations, and arm lengths, in order to assess the impact of geometry and scale on detection capabilities. We demonstrate that networks with an L-shaped ET design have stronger parity violation constraining power than networks with a triangular ET design, particularly seen when studying ET designs on their own.",
Cross submissions,Constraining interacting dark energy models with black hole superradiance,"Zhen-Hong Lyu,Rong-Gen Cai,Shao-Jiang Wang,Xiang-Xi Zeng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The recent preference for a dynamical dark energy (DE) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument seems to call for interactions between DE and dark matter (DM), either from direct DM-DE interaction or indirect interaction induced by modified gravity. Therefore, an independent probe for these kinds of DE-DM interactions would be appealing from observational aspects. In this paper, we propose the black hole superradiance as a novel astrophysical probe for field-theoretic interacting DE-DM models, providing complementary constraints independent of large-scale cosmological observations. The core principle is that the DE-DM interaction can alter the effective mass of the superradiant ultralight boson, thereby modifying its superradiant instability rate around spinning black holes. We explore this connection through two distinct scenarios: a model where the DE field mediates a dark fifth force within the DM sector, affecting the superradiance from DM particles; and a novel mechanism where the DE field itself becomes superradiant due to the effective mass enhancement induced by dense DM spikes around supermassive black holes. By applying a statistical framework to black hole observations in both scenarios, we derive constraints on the fundamental DE-DM coupling strength. Although the current constraints are rather loose due to small samples and inaccurate measurements, our work provides new astrophysical constraints on these interacting DE-DM scenarios and establishes a new synergy between black hole physics and cosmology for probing the fundamental nature of the dark sector.",
Cross submissions,Growth of Cosmic Strings with Field-Dependent Tension,Luca Brunelli,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"A novel mechanism to produce a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed. It has been found that fundamental superstrings can grow in a kinating background driven by the rolling of the volume modulus of Type IIB string compactifications towards the minimum of its potential. In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points. This talk is based onarXiv:2502.14953.",
Cross submissions,GSpyNetTreeS: a machine learning solution for glitch localization in time and frequency,"Man Leong Chan,Jess McIver,Yannick Lecoeuche,Dhatri Raghunathan,Sofía Álvarez-López,Julian Ding,Annudesh Liyanage,Raymond Ng,Heather Fong",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Data from ground-based gravitational wave detectors are often contaminated by non-Gaussian instrumental artifacts or detector noise transients. Unbiased source property estimation relies on the ability to correctly identify and characterize these artifacts and remove them if necessary. To this end, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has implemented candidate vetting for all significant candidates to identify the presence of artifacts and assess the need for mitigation. The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients. As a proof of concept, we tested GSpyNetTreeS's performance on the data collected by the LIGO detectors during the third observing run for gravitational waves as well as common detector glitch classes included in GSpyNetTree: Blip, Low frequency blip, Low frequency line and Scratchy. We also demonstrated that GSpyNetTreeS is capable of accurately identifying common glitch classes and capturing the frequency and time information associated with detected detector noise transients, establishing its potential as an automatic event validation tool for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs.",
Cross submissions,Quantum Optical Simulator for Unruh-DeWitt Detector Dynamics,Tai Hyun Yoon,Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a quantum-optical platform for simulating relativistic detector-field interactions using entangled nonlinear biphoton sources (ENBSs), realized through phase-controlled single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) sources. By mapping the dynamical evolution of this system onto the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector model, we show that signal-mode excitations emulate detector transitions driven by vacuum fluctuations, while coherently seeded idler modes act as an effective quantum field. This correspondence enables tabletop exploration of Unruh-like excitation, coherence harvesting, and field-induced entanglement. We derive the effective interaction Hamiltonian and Lindblad master equation for two coherently seeded ENBS units and obtain analytical solutions for the signal photon number \(N_{\rm sig}(t)\) and second-order correlation function \(g^{(2)}(0;t)\). Numerical simulations confirm that phase-dependent biphoton dynamics reproduce UDW-type behavior, including tunable excitation and quantum correlations. The output signal state exhibits controllable fidelity, interference visibility, and entanglement entropy as functions of the seeding phase and amplitude. These results establish ENBSs as experimentally accessible quantum simulators of relativistic field phenomena, providing a photonic testbed for analog gravitational effects, vacuum fluctuations, and spacetime-induced coherence-all within reach of current nonlinear-optics technology.",
Cross submissions,50-km fiber interferometer for testing gravitational signatures in quantum interference,"Haocun Yu,Dorotea Macri,Thomas Morling,Eleonora Polini,Thomas B. Mieling,Peter Barrow,Begüm Kabagöz,Xinghui Yin,Piotr T. Chruściel,Christopher Hilweg,Eric Oelker,Nergis Mavalvala,Philip Walther",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Quantum mechanics and general relativity are the foundational pillars of modern physics, yet experimental tests that combine the two frameworks remain rare. Measuring optical phase shifts of massless photons in a gravitational potential provides a unique quantum platform to probe gravity beyond Newtonian descriptions, but laboratory-based interferometers have not yet reached the sensitivity needed to access this regime. Here, we report the realization of a 50-km table-top Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometer operating at the single-photon level, achieving a phase sensitivity of $4.42\times10^{-6}$ rad root-mean-square (RMS) within the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 5 Hz. We demonstrate that this sensitivity is sufficient to resolve a phase-shift signal of $(6.18 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-5}$ rad RMS at 0.1 Hz, associated with a modulated gravity-induced signal. Our results establish a milestone for quantum sensing with large-scale optical interferometry, demonstrating the capability to detect gravitational redshifts in a local laboratory, thereby paving the way for testing quantum phenomena within general relativistic frameworks.",
Cross submissions,Entanglement first law for timelike entanglement entropy and linearized Einstein's equation,"Guo-Ying Li,Mei-Hui Xiao,Song He,Jia-Rui Sun",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We extend the entanglement first law of conformal field theory (CFT) to timelike subregions. Focusing on intervals along the time direction of the boundary CFT, we show that the associated timelike entanglement entropy obeys a first-law-like relation, with an effective entanglement temperature inversely proportional to the temporal size of the interval. By implementing a double Wick rotation, we obtain the exact modular Hamiltonian for a suitable hyperbolic subsystem and use it to formulate the timelike entanglement first law precisely. Our central result is a detailed proof that, in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime, this timelike entanglement first law is equivalent to linearized Einstein's equations in the bulk: the first law follows from the linearized equations and, conversely, implies them. Our result further reveal the dynamical connections between entanglement and gravity.",
Cross submissions,Magnetized particle motion and accretion process with shock cone morphology around a decoupled hairy black holes,"G. Mustafa,Faisal Javed,S.K. Maurya,A. Ditta,Orhan Donmez,Tayyab Naseer,Abdelmalek Bouzenada,Farruh Atamurotov",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Relativistic accretion onto compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars is one of the most efficient known mechanisms for converting gravitational potential energy into radiation. In the case of rapidly spinning black holes, up to $40\%$ of the rest-mass energy of accreting matter can be released, far exceeding the efficiency of nuclear fusion. In this work, we investigate magnetized particle motion and relativistic accretion processes around a decoupled hairy black hole via extended geometric deformation. The developed geometry involves two hairy parameters that preserve the horizon structure with the additional feature of the fulfillment of weak energy conditions outside the event horizon. We provide the foundation with necessary formalism for magnetized particle motion around a decoupled black hole. The effective potential and innermost stable circular orbits are then derived, which demonstrate a significant reduction of the radius of the latter quantity under the hairy parameters for the magnetized particle. Afterwards, we obtain exact analytical expressions for radial velocity profiles, mass accretion rates, and a few others which reveal improved energy efficiency and emissivity as compared to the standard black hole. Furthermore, the decoupling parameter shows strong influence on oscillations, accretion presenting fantastic agreement between analytical predictions and numerical simulations, and thus offering noticeable observational signatures for future gravitational wave and X-ray astronomy.",
Cross submissions,Analytic Computation of Dilaton Black Hole Quasinormal Modes via Seiberg-Witten Theory,"Jiahui Jiang,Wenhe Cai",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of dilaton black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity through a correspondence with the quantum Seiberg-Witten (SW) curve of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SU(2) gauge theory with $N_f=3$ hypermultiplets. By mapping both the black hole perturbation equation and the quantum SW curve to the confluent Heun form, the QNM problem is reformulated in a gauge-theoretic framework, and the spectrum is obtained via the SW quantization condition. The resulting frequencies show excellent agreement with those computed using the WKB and continued fraction methods, with typical deviations below $10^{-3}$. The QNM spectrum exhibits consistent trends: increasing the black hole charge or scalar field mass raises the oscillation frequency, while higher angular momentum reduces the damping rate. These results demonstrate the precision of the quantum SW framework in describing black hole perturbations and reveal new links between supersymmetric gauge theories and gravitational dynamics.",
Cross submissions,Constraining non-minimally coupled squared-Quartic Hilltop Inflation in light of ACT observations,"Jureeporn Yuennan,Farruh Atamurotov,Phongpichit Channuie",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The combination of the data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) with the recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate that the scalar spectral index \( n_s \) has a larger value than the Planck 2018 which leads to tension within standard inflationary models. In this study in order to explain the new data, We consider the squared-Quartic Hilltop inflation potential \( V(\phi) = V_0 [1 - \lambda (\phi/M_p)^4]^2 \) within the Einstein and Jordan frames. In the Jordan frame we introduce the coupling term \( \xi \phi^2 R \) and we calculate analytic expressions for the slow-roll parameters, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio on the weak and strong coupling regimes. In the weak limit (\( \xi \ll 1 \)), perturbative corrections slightly increase \( n_s \) and suppress \( r \), leading to \( n_s \simeq 0.9743 \) and \( r \sim 7.8 \times 10^{-5} \) for representative parameters \( \lambda = 10^{-3}, \xi = 10^{-3}, {\cal N} = 117 \), values which are in agreement with the joint Planck--ACT--DESI (P-ACT-LB) constraints. On the other hand, for a strong coupled (\( \xi \gg 1 \)), the conformal rescaling provides an exponentially flat potential plateau, which allows us to calculate \( n_s \approx 0.9743 \) with \( r \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4} \) for \( {\cal N} = 65{-}70 \), consistent with ACT and BK18 bounds. The associated energy scale of inflation, \( V_0^{1/4} \sim 10^{-3}{-}10^{-2} M_p \), remains compatible with high-scale inflationary scenarios.",
Cross submissions,Moving superfluids in the rotating universe,"Jose Beltrán Jiménez,Federico Piazza,Javier Vecino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study homogeneous cosmological models featuring shift-symmetric scalar fields (or, superfluids) in relative motion. In the presence of anisotropy this universe generally features rotation, in the sense that the principal axes of anisotropic expansion rotate with respect to the cosmic comoving frame. We focus in particular on the minimal case of two superfluids in 2+1 dimensions. The momentum constraint enforces their spatial gradients to be collinear and the dynamics tends to align such a direction with that of maximal expansion at late times. As opposed to the recently studied case of solids, rotation plays a more important role in the present two-superfluids model. The associated energy density does not dilute away but scales as that of anisotropy and affects the total equation of state. We find that purely non-rotating solutions correspond to an unstable surface in phase space in the direction of non-vanishing rotation. This suggests that rotation is a crucial feature of these scenarios that cannot be neglected.",
Cross submissions,How Significant are Cosmological Collider Signals in the Planck Data?,"Petar Suman,Dong-Gang Wang,Wuhyun Sohn,James R. Fergusson,E. P. S. Shellard",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The search for primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) is theoretically well motivated but remains observationally challenging. Tight constraints with low significance for the standard non-Gaussian shapes suggest that detection may lie beyond the reach of near-future experiments. However, tests of PNG are highly template-dependent. From a theory perspective, a whole new family of bispectrum shapes arise in the cosmological collider program, with distinct signatures of heavy particles during inflation. In this work, we provide a class of simplified collider templates for these particles that encompasses a broader range of masses, sound speeds, and interactions. We propose that, given the current state of observations, the most effective strategy to search for PNG signals is through orthogonalizing the collider templates, such that they are uncorrelated with the tightly constrained single field predictions. Using the Modal pipeline and Planck CMB data, we perform a systematic parameter scan of the collider templates with the most significant result reaching $2.4\sigma$ for spin-0, after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect; indicative results for spin-1 and spin-2 peak near 2$\sigma$. These results indicate that, with refined collider templates and improved data analysis strategies, there are credible prospects with forthcoming observations to detect PNG and also rule out single field inflation.",
