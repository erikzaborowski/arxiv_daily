New submissions,Detecting dark objects in the Solar System with Gravitational Wave observatories,"Valentin Thoss,Abraham Loeb",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Dark objects streaming into the solar system can be probed using gravitational wave (GW) experiments through the perturbations that they would induce on the detector test masses. In this work, we study the detectability of the resulting gravitational signal for a number of current and future GW observatories. Dark matter in the form of clumps or primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^7$-$10^{11}\,\rm{g}$ can be detected with the proposed DECIGO experiment.",
New submissions,There and back again: outspiralling motion in non-Kerr compact objects,"Manuel O. Mariano,Carlos A. R. Herdeiro",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In Keplerian dynamics, a test body orbiting a point particle in circular motion has a monotonically increasing frequency, with decreasing radius. If a dissipative channel is introduced, such as gravitational wave (GW) emission, (say) under the quadrupole approximation, the corresponding GW strain has an ever increasing frequency with time. A similar statement holds for equatorial motion of a test particle on the Kerr manifold, except such inspiral is cut off at the ISCO, wherein stable circular orbits cease to exist and a plunge is expected. We analyse circular timelike orbits in generic spinning spacetimes and study the conditions in which exotic motion can occur, due to the presence of non-Kerr features. In particular, we derive conditions under which an inspiral towards a compact object is naturally followed by an outspiral motion, and give concrete examples, as well as the corresponding GW phenomenology. This analysis serves both as a theoretical exploration of non-Kerrness as well as an example of a concrete smoking gun of exotic spacetimes.",
New submissions,Slow-Fast Evolution of Scalar Fields in Higher-Order Cosmological Gravity: Dynamics Inspired by the Pais--Uhlenbeck Oscillator,"Manuel Gonzalez-Espinoza(Valparaiso U., Catolica and U. Playa Ancha),Genly Leon(Catolica del Norte U. and DUT, Durban),Yoelsy Leyva(Tarapaca U.),Giovanni Otalora(Tarapaca U.),Andronikos Paliathanasis(Catolica del Norte U. and DUT, Durban and Stellenbosch U., South Africa),Aleksander Kozak(Catolica del Norte U.)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We investigate the cosmological dynamics of scalar fields governed by higher-order gravity, with particular emphasis on models inspired by the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator--a prototypical fourth-order system known for its connection to ghost-free formulations. By recasting the field equations into a slow-fast dynamical system, we analyze phase space evolution across exponential and power-law coupling regimes. Our approach integrates numerical simulations and geometric methods to visualize trajectories, stream flows, and asymptotic behavior under varying potential parameters. The underlying system admits singular surfaces and non-smooth transitions, revealing intricate dynamical structures. We examine the stability of de Sitter solutions, the crossing of the phantom divide, and the emergence of cyclic behavior through multiple-scale analysis. The inclusion of radiation and dust fluids enables the creation of realistic cosmological scenarios, including a transient matter-dominated era and a late-time accelerated expansion. Our results highlight the viability of Pais-Uhlenbeck scalar models in accounting for inflationary dynamics and dark energy, offering diagnostic tools for characterizing attractors and bifurcation phenomena in higher-derivative cosmology.",
New submissions,Gravitational Wave Peep Contributions to Background Signal Confusion Noise for LISA,"Daniel J Oliver,Aaron D Johnson,Lena Janssen,Joel Berrier,Kostas Glampedakis,Daniel Kennefick",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Two-body gravitational interactions will occasionally lead to a stellar-mass compact object entering a very highly eccentric orbit around a massive black hole at the center of a galaxy. Gravitational radiation damping will subsequently result in an extreme mass ratio inspiral. Much of the inspiral time of these events is spent with the compact object on a long-period orbit, with a brief burst of gravitational wave emission at periapsis firmly in the mHz band. Burst orbits have been previously modeled as parabolic, with a focus on extreme examples that could be detectable by space-based gravitational wave detectors. This work focuses on the recurring bursts called ""peeps"". Peeps are not likely to be individually resolvable; however, it is also important to consider them as possible sources of signal confusion noise because they do generate a signal within the LISA band with every pericenter passage. To account for peeps, we must utilize estimates for EMRI capture parameters along with tracking the massive black hole population out to a redshift of 3 using the Illustris Project. Then, this population is combined with an EMRI formation rate to estimate the number of EMRI events per unit volume for LISA. In this study, we model three different assumptions for the gravitational wave background produced by these highly eccentric peeps. We find that with our two most likely backgrounds, the signal may result in a slight rise of the LISA noise floor (SNR $\sim 0.3-2.4$); however, in the most abundant case, the background generated by these sources would be detectable on its own and likely obscure many potentially detectable sources (SNR $\sim77$).",
New submissions,Universality on thermodynamic relation with corrections in higher-dimensional de Sitter black holes,"Hai-Long Zhen,Yu-Bo Ma",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this study, the methodology proposed by Goon and Penco for investigating the universality on thermodynamic relations with corrections in de Sitter black holes is extended. A universal thermodynamic extremality relation, under consideration of the mass of the spacetime $M$ with various state parameters, proposed by Goon and Penco is investigated in higher dimensional spacetime, the established universal conclusions are not impacted by the convergence of energy from the coexistence region of two horizons to the point $N$ or $C$. Furthermore, by incorporating the shift of the angular momentum into our analysis, a more universal relation is derived, specifically applicable to rotating configurations. Notably, a novel conjecture is formulated that establishes a universal relationship framework connecting shifted thermodynamic quantities across arbitrary black hole backgrounds. These findings are expected to offer profound insights into the fundamental principles of quantum gravity.",
New submissions,"Study of Accelerated Expansion of Universe in the framework of $f (R, T )$ Gravity",Parbati Sahoo,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This thesis explores the late-time cosmic acceleration within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity, a general relativity modification that incorporates the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. Motivated by observational evidence for the universe's accelerated expansion and the limitations of Einstein's theory in explaining dark energy, we study exact cosmological solutions using various parametrizations of the deceleration parameter. The analysis includes isotropic and anisotropic models such as Bianchi type I universes with string fluid, bulk viscous matter, and magnetized strange quark matter. Several forms of time-varying deceleration parameters are employed to understand the dynamical behavior of the universe. We also examine finite-time singularities like the Big Rip and discuss their occurrence in both anisotropic and FLRW backgrounds. In addition, the thesis investigates higher-order curvature corrections and geometric modifications, including wormhole solutions, within the $f(R,T)$ formalism. Energy conditions are analyzed to assess the physical plausibility of these models. The overall work aims to provide a coherent and viable description of the universe's evolution under modified gravity theories.",
New submissions,A linear response relation in general relativity with applications to dense matter relativistic stars,Seema Satin,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),A new formalism in general relativity with a linear response relation between perturbed Einstein tensor and the stress-energy tensor is presented. Basic concepts are borrowed from statistical physics and theory of stochastic processes by extending them for a spacetime structure. We show qualitatively new results of the first applications which lay foundations for a sub-hydro mesoscopic theory in dense matter relativistic stars. This will enable one to probe structure and phenomena at intermediate scales in relativistic stars and exotic fluids that they are made up of. The overall aim is to build foundations for studying dynamical equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of astrophysical bodies based on stochastic correlations of perturbations of spacetime and matter fields. This will add to the present literature on asteroseismology a new insight in a significantthis http URLis also expected that this will lead to direct or indirect observational consequences of meso scale physics under extreme conditions present in the exotic objects.,
New submissions,Thermodynamic stability of superflows in General Relativity and Newtonian gravity,Lorenzo Gavassino,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech),"Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.",
New submissions,Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity and the Mass-Dimension Field Equation,Gabriele U. Varieschi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We resume our analysis of Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity (NFDG), an alternative gravitational model which does not require the Dark Matter (DM) paradigm. We add three more galaxies (NGC 6946, NGC 3198, NGC 2841) to the catalog of those studied with NFDG methods. Once again, NFDG can successfully reproduce the observed rotation curves by using a variable fractional dimension $D\left (R\right )$, as was done for nine other galaxies previously studied with these methods.In addition, we introduce a mass-dimension field equation for our model, which is capable of deriving the fractional mass-dimension $D_{m}\left( R \right)$ from first principles, as opposed to the previous $D\left (R\right )$ which was obtained simply by matching the experimental rotational velocity data for each galaxy. While the NFDG predictions computed with this new $D_{m}\left(R\right)$ dimension are not as accurate as those based on the original $D\left (R\right )$, they nevertheless confirm the validity of our fractional-dimension approach. Three previously studied galaxies (NGC 7814, NGC 6503, NGC 3741) were analyzed again with these new methods and their structure was confirmed to be free from any dark matter components.",
New submissions,On the Reinterpretation of Dark Energy as the Elasticity of Space,Muhammad Ghulam Khuwajah Khan,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this work, we demonstrate that by treating space as a three dimensional elastic membrane, one can interpret the energy density stored in it as Dark Energy. In particular, we will model space as an infinitely large fundamental 3 brane and show that its vacuum stress energy tensor has the same mathematical form which one expects from the stress energy tensor describing a Lorentz invariant vacuum energy density (Dark Energy). We identify the dark-energy density with the tension of the fundamental 3 brane and thereby establish a direct correspondence between the cosmological constant and brane tension. Finally, we present a brief argument as to why the Cosmological Constant should be treated as a fundamental constant of nature, based on some light ontological discussion regarding the origin of the tension term in the broader framework of String Theory. In a forthcoming work, we will articulate a dynamical mechanism, which will be grounded in Q-theory, Hawking-Wu flux neutralization and broken super-symmetry, demonstrating the precise cancellation of vacuum energy in a manner such that the fundamental brane (spatial) tension remains the unique source of the Cosmological Constant.",
New submissions,Corrected first law of thermodynamics for dynamical regular black holes,"Tianxu Huo,Chengzhou Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we establish the corrected first law of thermodynamics for dynamical regular black holes on both the event horizon and apparent horizon. We find that the temperature of dynamical regular black holes derived from the traditional first law differs from that obtained through other approaches. This indicates that, similar to static cases, the first law of thermodynamics requires correction. We then derive the corrected first law of thermodynamics from the Einstein field equations. Our analysis reveals that the corrected factor originates from the fact that the $ T^v_v $ component of the energy-momentum tensor depends on the black hole mass. This dependence implies that the mass of a regular black hole can no longer be directly identified as the internal energy, leading to the corrections of the first law of thermodynamics.",
New submissions,Thermal Behavior of Generalized Black-Bounce Black Hole Model,"Allan R. P. Moreira,Abdelmalek Bouzenada,Shi-Hai Dong,Guo-Hua Sun,Faizuddin Ahmed",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we tested the thermal behavior of a class of regular black hole solutions defined as generalized black-bounce spacetimes. We introduce several novel configurations governed by different mass functions and geometric deformations, illustrated by parameters controlling regularity and horizon structure. Using the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method, we compute the Hawking temperature associated with each model and analyze its dependence on the underlying parameters. We find that all proposed geometries are free of curvature singularities and exhibit positive, well defined quasi-local masses in the Hernandez Misner Sharp formalism. Also, we demonstrate that these models may possess multiple horizons, including extremal and asymmetric cases, while typically violating classical energy conditions in the vicinity of the bounce. Our results show and illustrate the structure and thermodynamic stability of these regular solutions.",
New submissions,Particle trajectories in light pulse spacetime,"Riccardo Falcone,Claudio Conti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In our previous work (Phys. Rev. Research 7, 033079), we derived the metric tensor for cylindrically shaped pulses with uniform energy density. Building upon that framework, we derive the complete set of geodesics with zero angular velocity. We show that perturbations in particle trajectories may be observed in gamma ray bursts. Also, deviations in the motion of moving particles are significantly larger than those previously found for particles that are initially at rest.",
New submissions,LensingFlow: An Automated Workflow for Gravitational Wave Lensing Analyses,"Mick Wright,Justin Janquart,Paolo Cremonese,Juno C.L. Chan,Alvin K.Y. Li,Otto A. Hannuksela,Rico K.L. Lo,Jose M. Ezquiaga,Daniel Williams,Michael Williams,Gregory Ashton,Rhiannon Udall,Anupreeta More,Laura Uronen,Ankur Barsode,Eungwang Seo,David Keitel,Srasthi Goyal,Jef Heynen,Anna Liu","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)","In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10 signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its automated checks of results from consituent analyses.",
New submissions,Confronting Inflation and Reheating with Observations: Improved Predictions Beyond Slow-Roll,"Ying-Ying Ye,Bao-Min Gu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Using the latest observational data, we constrain the inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. Predictions for both phases can be significantly improved by employing numerically computed results compared to the slow-roll approximations. These results enable a more accurate reassessment of the observational viability of inflationary models, provide tighter constraints on the reheating history, and help lift the degeneracies in the predictions of inflation and reheating dynamics. Given current observational bounds, this enables a more accurate understanding of the early universe physics.",
New submissions,Fuzzy dark matter soliton as gravitational lens,Ke Wang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM) solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$. Therefore, this FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge $\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently, this small magnification factor in that large magnification zone means a small antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background, even though this antisotropy is out of the sensitivity of the pulsar timing arrays today.",
New submissions,Dynamic shadow of a black hole with a self-interacting massive complex scalar hair,"Mingzhi Wang,Cheng-Yong Zhang,Songbai Chen,Jiliang Jing",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We research dynamic shadows of a black hole with a self-interacting massive complex scalar hair. The complex scalar field $\psi$ evolves with time $t$, whose magnitude on apparent horizon $|\psi_{h}|$ starts from zero, undergoes a sharp rise followed by rapid oscillations, and eventually converges to a constant value. The variation of the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$ is similar to that of the magnitude $|\psi_{h}|$. The emergence of the complex scalar hair $\psi$ causes the apparent horizon radius $r_{h}$ to start increasing sharply, and smoothly approaches a stable value eventually. The shadow radius $R_{sh}$ of the black hole with an accretion disk increases with $t_{o}$ the time at the observer's position. In the absence of an accretion disk, the shadow radius $R_{sh}$ is larger and also increases as $t_{o}$ increases. Furthermore, we slice the dynamical spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces for all time points $t$. For the case with an accretion disk, the variation of $R_{sh}$ is similar to that of the apparent horizon $r_{h}$, because the inner edge of the accretion disk extends to the apparent horizon. In the absence of an accretion disk, the variation of $R_{sh}$ is similar to that of the photon sphere $r_{ps}$, because the black hole shadow boundary is determined by the photon sphere. Since the variation of $r_{ps}$ is induced by $\psi$, it can be stated that the variation in the size of the shadow is likewise caused by the change of $\psi$. Regardless of the presence or absence of the accretion disk, the emergence of the complex scalar hair $\psi$ causes the radius $R_{sh}$ of the shadow to start changing. Moreover, we investigate the time delay $\Delta t$ of lights propagating from light sources to observer. These findings not only enrich the theoretical models of dynamic black hole shadows but also provide a foundation for testing black hole spacetime dynamics.",
New submissions,Geometric reflective boundary conditions for asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces,Ludovic Souêtre,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"This article solves the initial boundary value problem for the vacuum Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant in dimension 4, giving rise to asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces. We introduce a new family of geometric reflective boundary conditions, which can be regarded as the homogeneous Robin boundary conditions, involving both the conformal class and the stress-energy tensor of the timelike conformal boundary. This family includes as a special case the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition, consisting of setting the boundary stress-energy tensor to zero. It also agrees, in a limit case, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, where one fixes a locally conformally flat conformal class on the boundary, already covered in Friedrich's pioneering work of 1995.The proof of local existence and uniqueness for this family of boundary conditions relies notably on Friedrich's framework and his extended conformal Einstein equations. These are rewritten in a tensorial formalism, rather than a spinorial one, as it facilitates the comparison with the Fefferman-Graham expansion of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter metrics. Similarly to Friedrich's proof, our geometric boundary conditions are eventually inferred from gauge-dependent boundary conditions by means of an auxiliary system on the conformal boundary.In addition, our analysis also comprises new necessary and sufficient conditions for the unphysical fields associated to the initial data to be smooth up to the conformal boundary. Finally, the paper contains examples of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces, with a focus on their conformal boundary data. This provides valuable insight into the possible shapes of boundary stress-energy tensors.",
New submissions,On the generation of primordial matter by spatial curvature in the early universe,"V. E. Kuzmichev,V. V. Kuzmichev(Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In this note, it is shown that a nonvanishing spatial curvature can generate primordial matter in the post-inflation era. This matter does not depend on the curvature parameter and is described by a stiff equation of state. It can have the properties of spin matter, consisting of particles with a spin quantum number (spin) s = 1/2. Such a matter can be plausibly identified with quark matter at the early stage of the evolution of the universe.",
New submissions,GW231123: Binary Black Hole Merger or Cosmic String?,"Iuliu Cuceu,Marie Anne Bizouard,Nelson Christensen,Mairi Sakellariadou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported an exceptional gravitational-wave event, GW231123. This gravitational-wave signal was assumed to be generated from the merger of a binary black hole system, with source frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17}~\textup{M}_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}~ \textup{M}_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals). As seen by the two LIGO detectors, the signal has only $\sim 5$ cycles, between 30 and 80 Hz, over $\sim 10$ ms. It is of critical importance to confirm the origin of this signal. Here we present the results of a Bayesian model comparison to test whether the gravitational-wave signal was actually generated by a binary black hole merger, or emitted from cusps or kinks on a cosmic string. We find significant evidence for a binary black hole merger origin of the signal.",
New submissions,Ultralight boson constraints from gravitational wave observations of spinning binary black holes,"P.S. Aswathi,William E. East,Nils Siemonsen,Ling Sun,Dana Jones",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In the presence of an ultralight scalar or vector boson, a spinning black hole will be spun down through the superradiant instability. We use spin measurements from gravitational wave observations of binary black holes, in particular the heavy binary black hole merger event GW231123, along with the lower-mass GW190517 event, to constrain the existence of ultralight bosons. We disfavor scalars with masses in the range of $[0.55, 11]\times 10^{-13}$ eV and vectors in the range of $[0.11, 18]\times 10^{-13}$ eV, making only a conservative assumption that the black hole lifetimes are greater than $10^5$ years. The lower ends of these ranges, where the exclusion confidence is the highest, were not previously excluded by spin measurements from electromagnetic or gravitational wave observations. We map these constraints to axion and dark photon models with interactions.",
New submissions,Heat Capacity and the Violation of Scaling Laws in Gravitational System,Shi-Bei Kong,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we examine the scaling laws in gravitational system from the perspective of free energy landscape. It has been found that for some special black holes, their critical exponents are beyond mean field theory, and more surprisingly violate the scaling laws. We find that the main reason for the violation of the scaling laws is that the heat capacity at constant volume for these black holes is 0, so the critical exponent $\alpha$ is often treated as 0 and can not be derived from the scaling hypothesis while another three critical exponents can. We also find that the strange critical exponents means there is a symmetry violation in the order parameter.",
Cross submissions,Dark energy constraints in light of theoretical priors,"Neel Shah,Kazuya Koyama,Johannes Noller",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.",
Cross submissions,Timelike entanglement and central charge for quantum BTZ black holes,Dibakar Roychowdhury,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We compute holographic timelike entanglement entropy for quantum BTZ black holes in a Karch-Randall braneworld scenario. These black holes are exact solutions of massive 3d gravity on the brane and are conjectured to be dual to thermal states in 2d defect CFTs, living at the interface of the brane and the boundary of the bulk $AdS_4$. Our analysis reveals an interesting relation between the tEE and the central charge pertaining to the dual CFT, which receives nontrivial corrections due to quantum backreaction effects on the Karch-Randall brane, which is explored non-perturbatively.",
Cross submissions,Constraints on extra charges in dyonic Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole from the observations of quasi-periodic oscillations,"Hamza Rehman,Saddam Hussain,Ghulam Abbas,Tao Zhu",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper investigates the influence of the dimensionless electric charge ($Q/M$), magnetic charge ($P/M$), and Taub-NUT parameter ($n/M$) of a dyonic Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray binaries. Using the relativistic precession model, we calculate the three fundamental frequencies arising from particle motion in the accretion disk around the black hole. These theoretical predictions are then confronted with observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915$+$105, and H1743-322), and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is used to constrain the black hole parameters. Our analysis reveals no significant evidence for nonzero values of $Q/M$ and $P/M$ across all sources, thereby allowing us to place several stringent upper limits on electric charge ($Q/M$) and magnetic charge ($P/M$) of the black hole in these systems. Similarly, no compelling indication of a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter is found in QPOs from GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564, and H1743-322. In contrast, the posterior distribution derived from GRS 1915$+$105 data suggests a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter, i.e., gravitomagnetic monopole moment. This result indicates a potential deviation from the Kerr metric in this astrophysical black hole.",
Cross submissions,Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Multi-Messenger Systematics and Prospects with Next-Generation Facilities,"Nathan Steinle,Samar Safi-Harb,Matt Nicholl,Isabelle Worssam,Benjamin P. Gompertz",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework in anticipation of future GW and EM detectors. We demonstrate how combining models of different aspects of the BNS progenitor-merger-remnant system into a full multi-messenger modeling pipeline reveals insight into modeling challenges that will need to be addressed in the coming decade of multi-messenger astronomy. Motivated by GW170817, this combined model relates the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We find joint correlations between the GW and EM observables that depend on a complicated interplay between modeling assumptions and theoretical uncertainties. Next generation detectors will generically provide multi-messenger constraints on BNSs with median GW network signal-to-noise ratio $\approx 10$, median of the 90$^{\rm th}$ percentile sky area $\approx 10$ sq. deg., and kilonova $i$-band apparent magnitudes ranging from $\approx 33$ to $23$. We find no more than 4\% of the BNSs are simultaneously detectable by a network of two Cosmic Explorers and one Einstein Telescope and by the Roman and Rubin telescopes for 55 and 180 sec. exposures in a $K$-like band and $i$ and $g$ bands, respectively. We discuss key modeling assumptions that will be transmitted as multi-messenger systematics in the analysis of future datasets, such as uncertain astrophysical processes of binary populations and the nuclear equation of state for tests of nuclear physics and dark matter.",
Cross submissions,Quasi-topological mass generation for 3D linearized gravity,"Erica Bertolini,Edoardo Lui,Nicola Maggiore",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a new mass generation mechanism for linearized gravity in three spacetime dimensions, which consists of a lower-dimensional Chern-Simons-like term added to the invariant action. The propagators of the gauge fixed massive action show a massive pole and a good massless limit. Moreover, we show that, as the Topological Massive Gravity model of Deser, Jackiw and Templeton, this theory displays one propagating massive DoF, which can be traced back to the transverse part of the spatial Ricci tensor. Finally, the action of this linearized massive gravity is characterized by an algebraic structure formed by a set of Ward operators, which uniquely determine the theory.",
Cross submissions,Fiducial observers and the thermal atmosphere in the black hole quantum throat,"Thomas G. Mertens,Thomas Tappeiner,Bruno de S. L. Torres",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a construction of fiducial observers in the throat region of near-extremal black holes within the framework of JT quantum gravity, leading to a notion of local observers in a highly quantum regime of the gravitational field. The construction is based on an earlier proposal for light-ray anchoring to the asymptotic boundary and is uniquely fixed at the semiclassical level by demanding that the notion of time translations for an observer at the asymptotic boundary of JT gravity should be extended into the bulk as the flow of a conformal isometry. Since conformal isometries are a necessary condition for geometric modular flow, our construction is amenable as a candidate geometric gravitational dressing that may be interpreted via the modular crossed product, potentially connecting our choice of dressing with recent developments on the literature on local observables in quantum gravity. Taking this definition beyond the semiclassical regime, we compute quantum gravitational wormhole contributions to the black hole thermal atmosphere, directly producing a finite thermal entropy and leading to a quantum description of the stretched horizon in this model.",
