New submissions,Cosmological Implications of a New Creation Field in Hoyle-Narlikar Gravity with Bulk Viscous Fluid,"Manish Yadav,Archana Dixit,Anirudh Pradhan,M. S. Barak",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the Narlikar gravity model with bulk viscous fluid by the new foam of creation field $C(t) = t + \int \alpha (1 - a)dt + c_1$, based on the Hoyle-Narlikar's creation-field theory, using a joint analysis of Observational Hubble Data (OHD) and the Pantheon supernova (PP) compilation. Our analysis reveals that the creation field coupling constant $(f)$ is always positive within the Narlikar gravity model from OHD+PP data sets. The best-fit estimates yield $ H_0 = 71.2 \pm 2.1 \text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\xi_0 = 0.23$, quoted at the $1 \sigma$ level. The Narlikar gravity model predicts a transition redshift of $z_t \approx 0.63$ marking the onset of late-time cosmic acceleration, with the corresponding age of the Universe estimated as $13.50\pm1.80 Gyr$. Interestingly, the inferred higher value of $H_0$, relative to SH0ES determinations, suggests a possible alleviation of the $\sim 4.1\sigma$ Hubble tension. Furthermore, we assess the stability of the model and demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be consistently explained through the energy conditions. This model retains dynamical flexibility while ensuring analytical tractability and provides a promising framework to investigate the cosmological implications of Hoyle-Narlikar gravity, particularly regarding late-time acceleration and the evolution of dark energy.",
New submissions,Quantum interference in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar spacetime,Yingdong Wu,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate gravitationally induced interference within the framework of teleparallel gravity, deriving a general expression for the gravitational phase difference and applying it to an EMS spacetime. We then analyze how this phase difference is affected by the presence or absence of black hole charge. Our results show that, irrespective of charge, the dominant contribution to the gravitational phase difference arises from the black hole mass. Nevertheless, while the influence of charge is negligible under standard astrophysical conditions, we identify a possible amplification mechanism through its interplay with the coupling parameter $\alpha$ in the case of extremal charged black holes. This finding not only offers new theoretical insights but also suggests experimental opportunities for probing charged black hole parameters via quantum interferometric techniques.",
New submissions,Generalized Holographic and Ricci Dark Energy: Cosmological Diagnostics and Scalar Field Realizations,Antonio Pasqua,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we present two generalized formulations of the Holographic and Ricci dark energy (DE) models, given by $ \rho_{GH} = 3c^2M^{2}_{pl} \left[ 1-\epsilon\left(1-\frac{R}{H^2}\right) \right]H^2$ and $\rho_{GR} = 3c^2M^{2}_{pl}\left[ 1-\eta\left(1-\frac{H^2}{R}\right) \right]R$ where $H$ and $R$ denote the Hubble parameter and the Ricci scalar, while $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ are model parameters related by $\epsilon = 1 - \eta$. We derived explicit analytical expressions for key cosmological quantities, including the Hubble parameter, the DE density $\rho_D$, the DE pressure $p_D$, the equation of state parameter of DE $\omega_D$ and the deceleration parameter $q$. The analysis was carried out for four distinct cases: (i) the standard model in its original formulation; (ii) the inclusion of spatial curvature; (iii) the addition of interactions between the dark sectors; and (iv) the presence of both interaction and curvature. Moreover, we also considered the limiting case of a DE Dominated Universe.To further characterize the dynamical features of the models, we investigated several diagnostic tools, namely the Statefinder parameters, the cosmographic approach, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic and the squared speed of the sound $v_s^2$ to assess stability against perturbations. Moreover, we established a correspondence between the DE models we studied and some scalar field theories, including tachyon, k-essence, dilaton, quintessence, Dirac-Born-Infeld, Yang-Mills and Nonlinear Electrodynamics (NLED) fields.",
New submissions,Penrose Process Efficiency and Irreducible Mass in Rotating Einstein-Born-Infeld Black Holes with Nonlinear Electrodynamics,"Urooj Fatima,G. Abbas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the extraction of rotational energy from rotating Einstein-Born-Infeld (EBI) black holes, where nonlinear electrodynamics introduces a radius-dependent effective charge modifying the spacetime geometry. Focusing on neutral test particles in the equatorial plane, we derive analytic expressions for their kinematics and establish conditions for negative energy orbits essential to the Penrose process using the near-horizon limit and Wald inequality. We present a closed-form expression for maximal energy extraction efficiency as a function of spin, charge, and the Born-Infeld parameter $\beta$. Our numerical survey reveals that increasing charge and nonlinear Born-Infeld effects generally reduce horizon radius and ergoregion size, suppressing energy extraction efficiency compared to Kerr and often Kerr-Newman black holes. However, at certain spins and \$beta$, the EBI geometry can enhance efficiency beyond Kerr-Newman. We also compute the irreducible mass, showing how nonlinear electromagnetic dynamics reduce the horizon area and the associated entropy proxy. These results provide a unified picture linking nonlinear electrodynamics, horizon structure, and energy extraction efficiency across relevant parameters.",
New submissions,Black Holes with Accretion Disks as High-Energy Particle Colliders,Delilah E. A. Gates,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In principle, rapidly rotating black holes (BHs) with accretion disks -- either prograde or retrograde -- could naturally act as high-energy particle colliders (HEPCs) because particles falling in from infinity that collide with particles in the disk near the BH horizon can exhibit center-of-mass (CM) energies beyond the capabilities of terrestrial instruments. However, we show that scattering can moderate the CM energy of near-horizon collisions. We find that rapidly rotating BHs with prograde accretion disks are the most viable candidates for astrophysical HEPCs, whereas BHs with retrograde disks are disfavored, when scattering is incorporated.",
New submissions,Frequency-domain self-force calculations using Gegenbauer reconstruction,"Christopher Whittall,Leor Barack,Oliver Long",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the use of the Gegenbauer procedure for time-domain reconstruction in frequency-domain calculations of the self-force on a particle orbiting a black hole. The conventional technique relies on the so-called method of extended homogeneous solutions (EHS), which circumvents the Gibbs phenomenon that would otherwise hamper the reconstruction of the particle's field from frequency modes. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of EHS reconstruction deteriorates rapidly with increasing orbital eccentricity, due to large numerical cancellations between frequency-mode contributions. Furthermore, the method is only suitable for bound orbits and cannot be fully applied in scattering scenarios. The Gegenbauer reconstruction procedure involves a re-projection of the partial Fourier representation onto a complementary basis of polynomials. The resulting series converges exponentially while averting the cancellation problem. We demonstrate the procedure with numerical results for the spherical harmonic modes of the scalar field sourced by a scalar charge in orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We illustrate the merits of this approach, and discuss the challenges that remain for a full Gegenbauer-based self-force calculation.",
New submissions,Black holes black out: total absorption in time-dependent scattering,"Furkan Tuncer,Vitor Cardoso,Rodrigo Panosso Macedo,Thomas F. M. Spieksma",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Optics (physics.optics),"We uncover a new class of phenomena in gravitational physics, whereby resonances in the complex plane can be excited via tailored time-dependent scattering. We show that specific forms of temporal modulation of an incoming signal can lead to complete absorption for the entire duration of the scattering process. This, then, makes stars and black holes truly black. Such ``virtual absorption'' stores energy with high efficiency, releasing it once the process finishes via relaxation into the characteristic virtual absorption modes -- also known as total transmission modes -- of the object. While such modes are challenging to obtain and four-dimensional black holes have a restricted set of solutions, we also show that higher dimensional black holes have a complex and interesting structure of virtual absorption modes.",
New submissions,Quantum Gravity and Inflation as an Open System: A New Paradigm,"Alan Sebasti√°n Morales,Mauricio Bellini,Juan Ignacio Musmarra",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"As part of our program to develop a general theory of relativity for open systems, we introduce a covariant theory that incorporates the effects of classical and quantum spacetime alterations in a new metric tensor that effectively includes these alterations, thereby generating a Riemannian manifold from a new varied action without boundary terms. We illustrate the theory by studying an inflationary model which incorporates the quantum feedback effects of spacetime on the dynamics of the inflaton field $\hat{\varphi}$, enabling the simultaneous quantization of $\hat{\varphi}$ and the fluctuating gravitational field $\hat{\Omega}$ without relying on perturbative theory. We obtain an exact solution for the modes of both fields, $\hat{\varphi}$ and $\hat{\Omega}$, which comply with different quantum algebras. The normalization of the inflaton field modes that is obtained is intrinsically related to the geometric field modes, in such a way that the quantization of the fields results from an expression that links the geometric fields with the physical fields. Finally, the quadratic fluctuations of spacetime are calculated, and its spectrum is analyzed.",
New submissions,Reconstructing inflation in a generalized Rastall theory of gravity,"Ramon Herrera,Carlos Rios",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the reconstruction of standard and generalized Rastall gravity inflationary models, using the scalar spectral index and the Rastall parameter expressed as functions of the number of $e-$folds $N$. Within a general formalism, we derive the effective potential in terms of the relevant cosmological parameters and the Rastall parameter for these gravity frameworks. As a specific example, we analyze the attractor $n_s(N) - 1 \propto N^{-1}$, first by considering constant values of the Rastall parameter to reconstruct the inflationary stage in standard Rastall gravity, and then by assuming a linear dependence on the number of $e-$folds $N$ to reconstruct the inflationary model in generalized Rastall gravity. Thus, the reconstruction of the potential $V(\phi)$ is obtained for both standard and generalized Rastall gravity inflationary models. In both frameworks, we constrain key parameters of the reconstructed models during inflation using the latest observational data from Planck.",
New submissions,Effects of multidimensional treatment of gravity in simulations on supernova gravitational waves,"Hajime Sotani,Bernhard M√ºller,Tomoya Takiwaki",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Supernova explosions are expected as one of the promising candidates for gravitational wave sources. In this study, we examine the supernova gravitational waves, focusing on the multidimensional treatment of gravity in the simulation. For this purpose, we newly performed two-dimensional relativistic simulations with a nonmonopole (two-dimensional) potential and compared the resultant gravitational wave signals in the simulations with the frequencies of the proto-neutron stars with and without the Cowling approximation. Then, we find that the proto-neutron star frequencies with the Cowling approximation overestimate the gravitational wave frequencies. On the other hand, the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations with metric perturbations agree well with the gravitational wave signals in the simulations. Employing the new data, we derive a new fitting formula for the supernova gravitational wave frequencies with the two-dimensional gravitational potential, independently of the progenitor mass. Combining this new formula with the previous one derived from the Cowling approximation, we also derive the formula to predict the gravitational wave frequencies with a two-dimensional potential, using those with a monopole potential.",
New submissions,Modeling Gravastar Structure admitting Kuchowicz Spacetime in Rastall Gravity Theory,"Tayyab Naseer,M. Sharif,Areej Tabassum",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper investigates the gravastar model as a potential alternative to black holes, utilizing the Kuchowicz metric in the context of Rastall gravity. The model comprises three distinct regions: an interior with positive energy density and negative pressure, a thin intermediate shell made of ultra-relativistic stiff fluid, and an exterior vacuum. The negative pressure within the interior generates an outward force exerted on the shell, fulfilling the Zel'dovich criterion. This configuration eliminates the central singularity and replaces the event horizon with the shell. We then derive the radial metric functions for both the inner and thin region, yielding a non-singular solution. Furthermore, we examine the physical properties of the shell, such as its energy, proper length, entropy, equation of state parameter, gravitational redshift and adiabatic index, across a range of Rastall parameter values. We conclude that the resulting gravastar model offers a promising solution to the singularity problem of conventional black holes within the context of this non-conservative theory.",
New submissions,Toward a Theory of Gravitational Wave Turbulence,"Holly Krynicki,Jiaxi Wu,Elias R. Most",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph),"General relativity describes the dynamics of gravitational waves, which can feature nonlinear interactions, such as those underlying turbulent processes. Theoretical and numerical explorations have demonstrated the existence of gravitational wave turbulence, of which a full and general mathematical description is currently not known. Here, we take essential steps towards such a theory. Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We further show that nonlinear interactions described by this equation are in part Alfv√©nic, linking gravitational wave turbulence to Alfv√©nic turbulence. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of nonlinear gravitational wave dynamics through insights from magnetohydrodynamics.",
New submissions,Axion boson stars with wormhole topology,"Chen-Hao Hao,Yong-Qiang Wang,Jieci Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate a novel gravitational configuration formed by a massless real phantom field and an axion scalar field, minimally coupled to gravity. This system describes an Ellis-type wormhole situated at the center of an axion star. By normalizing the mass of the axion field to unity, the physical properties of the model are determined by three independent parameters: the potential's decay constant, the frequency of the axion field, and the wormhole's throat parameter. We assess the traversability of this wormhole by examining the curvature scalars and energy conditions of the static solution. Our analysis of the wormhole's embedding diagrams indicates that, although the wormhole typically exhibits a single-throat geometry, a double-throat configuration featuring an equatorial plane may arise under specific conditions. Finally, an analysis of the null-geodesics reveals the existence of at least one unstable light ring at the wormhole throat.",
New submissions,Attention U-Net for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches,Damon H. T. Cheung,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.",
New submissions,Cosmological Tensions with Non-Extensive Entropic Cosmology: A Modified Stress-Energy Approach,"A. Khodam-Mohammadi,M. Monshizadeh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We perform a comprehensive cosmographic analysis of Friedmann cosmologies modified by non-extensive entropy frameworks, focusing on Tsallis, R√©nyi, and Kaniadakis entropies within a novel modified energy-momentum tensor approach. In our approach the microscopic matter density remains $\rho=m~n$ while the horizon thermodynamics of non-extensive entropy modifies the effective source that drives expansion, $\rho_{eff}=f(\rho)\rho$ which reduces to the standard case for $f(\rho)=1$. By deriving the generalized Friedmann equations for each entropy type, we calculate analytical expressions for key cosmographic parameters, including the deceleration ($q_0$), jerk ($j_0$), snap ($s_0$), and lerk ($l_0$) parameters, and examine their behavior compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results reveal significant differences between the traditional formal approach and the modified energy-momentum approach, particularly in the Tsallis model where cosmographic parameters and the dimensionless Hubble function $E(z)$ show notable deviations for deformation parameters away from unity. Moreover, both R√©nyi and Kaniadakis models exhibit increasing tension with $\Lambda$CDM at higher redshifts, while remaining similar at low redshifts. Importantly, given the persistent $\sim5\sigma$ Hubble tension between local and global measurements, our analysis indicates that the flexibility of the modified entropic cosmology framework to alter the expansion rate could potentially alleviate this discrepancy by modifying the effective expansion history in a way compatible with observations. Future work will involve full Bayesian analyses with Pantheon+, DESI, and Planck data to further assess the viability of these models in resolving current cosmological tensions.",
New submissions,"""Chat"" between extreme mass ratio inspirals and Galactic binaries in LISA data","Sviatoslav Khukhlaev,Stanislav Babak",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The future space-based gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, is expected to observe between a few and a few thousand extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) per year. Due to the simultaneous presence of other gravitational wave signals in the data, it can be challenging to detect EMRIs and accurately estimate their parameters. In this work, we investigate the interaction between a gravitational signal from an EMRI and millions of signals from inspiralling Galactic white dwarf binaries. We demonstrate that bright Galactic binaries contaminate the detection and characterization of EMRIs. We perform Bayesian inference of EMRI parameters after removing resolvable Galactic binaries and confirm an accuracy comparable to that expected in Gaussian noise.",
New submissions,Schwarzschild Spacetime and the Local Limit of Nonlocal Gravity,"Yahya Mohammadi,Javad Tabatabaei,Shant Baghram,Bahram Mashhoon",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate static spherically symmetric solutions within the framework of the local limit of nonlocal gravity. This theory departs from Einstein's general relativity (GR) through the introduction of a scalar gravitational susceptibility function $S(x)$, $1+S > 0$, which is a new feature of the spacetime that vanishes in the GR limit. It is shown that the Schwarzschild spacetime constitutes an exact solution of the modified source-free gravitational field equations provided $S$ is a constant. The mass of the corresponding Schwarzschild solution is given by $M/(1+S)$, where $M$ denotes the mass of the solution in the GR limit. The interpretation of the solution in terms of a black hole is ruled out due to the divergence of the algebraic invariants of the Weitzenb√∂ck torsion at the Schwarzschild horizon.",
New submissions,A meshfree approach for rapid reconstruction of compact binary sources detected in the network of international gravitational wave detectors,Lalit Pathak,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"This thesis explores parameter estimation methods for rapidly reconstructing compact binary sources generating gravitational waves. It employs numerical linear algebra and meshfree approximation techniques to expedite waveform generation and likelihood evaluation, crucial for estimating binary parameters like masses, spins, distance, and sky location. The thesis demonstrates the effectiveness of these methods through simulations and real GW events, highlighting their potential for multimessenger astronomy and future gravitational wave observatories.",
New submissions,Inter-Spacecraft Tilt-to-Length Noise Reduction Algorithm for Taiji Mission,"Qiong Deng,Leiqiao Ye,Ke An,Yidi Fan,Ruihong Gao,Ziren Luo,Minghui Du,Pengcheng Wang,Peng Xu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The Taiji mission for space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection employs laser interferometry to measure picometer-scale distance variations induced by GWs. The tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise in the inter-spacecraft interferometers, which originates from the angular jitters of the spacecrafts and the movable optical subassemblies, is predicted to be one of the main noise sources that might reduce Taiji's sensitivity to GWs. Since these angular jitters can be read out through the differential wavefront sensors, it is possible to suppress TTL noise during the data processing stage by fitting and subtracting it. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for TTL noise suppression, which addresses the issue of unknown noise floor required for optimal estimation in the practical detection scenario, and the design of this algorithm takes into account the presence of GW signals. The algorithm is validated via numerical simulation, which is built on a spacecraft dynamics simulation incorporating Taiji's drag-free and attitude control system. We also demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm by varying TTL coefficients at different levels, indicating that our algorithm is applicable to a range of payload statuses, and ultimately providing a critical advancement toward realizing Taiji's full sensitivity.",
New submissions,Polarimetry imprints of exotic compact objects: relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars,"Hanna Liis Tamm,Nicolas Aimar,Jo√£o Lu√≠s Rosa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Recent observations of polarimetric parameters of active galactic nuclei motivate the study of polarization in the spacetime of exotic compact objects which can mimic the features of black holes in the strong field regime of gravity. In this work, we study the properties of two models for ultra-compact objects containing light rings - relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars. We have simulated the orbit of a hot spot around the considered objects in the polarization ray-tracing software GYOTO, and extracted observables, namely integrated images of the Stokes parameters I, Q, U; their evolution during the orbit in the QU-plane, and the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Our models resemble the black hole qualitatively, with slight additional imprints which provide a useful tool to constrain the spacetime metric of supermassive compact objects with current and future observations, and probe the fundamental properties of these objects. We have found that one fluid star model with a pressure singularity resembles the black hole entirely, while another gravastar features notable differences in the EVPA curve in the low-inclination case. Since differences between the models become more pronounced for a higher inclination, our results could potentially restrict the adequateness of ECO classes with future high-inclination observations.",
Cross submissions,The Aharonov-Bohm effect: reality and folklore,Henrique Gomes,History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) effect has been a major focus of the foundations of physics. And yet, much confusion persists. In particular, the effect purportedly leads to a dilemma: on one horn, we have a non-local action of a gauge-invariant quantity on charged particles; on the other, we get a local action on these particles, but of a non-gauge invariant quantity. This is the folklore, but the folklore is filled with misconceptions. Here, by deploying a recently defended formulation of gauge theory that dispenses with principal bundles, gauge potentials, and explicit gauge symmetries, I argue, with previous authors, that the A-B effect can be understood gauge-independently. But here my argument will go further: I will show that the A-B effect, when expressed in terms of the covariant derivative of a vector bundle, is \emph{entirely} analogous to the holonomy of spacetime vectors, and can be understood completely locally. The only surprising idea illustrated by the A-B effect is that, in some circumstances, there is more to the covariant derivative than can be accounted for by the curvature and underlying topology of a vector bundle.",
Cross submissions,Holography for de Sitter bubble geometries,"Anastasios Irakleous,Fran√ßois Rondeau,Nicolaos Toumbas",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We generalize the de Sitter static patch holographic proposal and the bilayer holographic entanglement entropy prescription to de Sitter geometries containing a bubble of smaller positive or vanishing cosmological constant. When the causal patch of an observer at the center of the bubble overlaps with the ``parent'' de Sitter region, we propose that the full spacetime can be holographically encoded on two holographic screens. The leading geometrical entanglement entropy between the two screens, which can be constant or time-dependent in some cases, never exceeds the Gibbons-Hawking entropy associated with the ``parent'' de Sitter space. When the causal patch of the observer at the center of the bubble is causally disconnected from the ``parent'' de Sitter region, the holographic proposal no longer applies, and more than two holographic screens are required to encode the whole spacetime.",
Cross submissions,Carroll spinors,"Daniel Grumiller,Lea Mele,Luciano Montecchio",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This crisp summary of salient aspects of Carroll spinors is dedicated to the memory of Dharam Ahluwalia, the intrepid champion of ELKO spinors.",
Cross submissions,From Cusps to Swallowtails: Domain Wall singularities in 2+1 dimensions,"Jose J. Blanco-Pillado,Daniel Jim√©nez-Aguilar,Oriol Pujol√†s",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The effective Nambu-Goto description of $(2+1)$-dimensional domain walls predicts singular behavior of its worldsheet resulting in swallowtail bifurcations. This phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of cusps, which emerge in different forms that we identify and classify. We describe in detail how swallowtail bifurcations generically arise in the collision of wiggles on straight domain wall strings, as well as in the collapse of closed loops, even for smooth initial conditions. Remarkably, by means of accurate lattice simulations, we find that these distinctive swallowtail features are reproduced in the field theory evolution of sufficiently thin walls, typically emitting a significant fraction of their initial energy in the process. These results suggest that such singular evolutions could potentially have important implications for the observable signatures associated with the collapse of domain wall networks in (3+1) dimensions in the early universe.",
Cross submissions,Where did heavy binaries go? Gravitational-wave populations using Delaunay triangulation with optimized complexity,"Rodrigo Tenorio,Alexandre Toubiana,Tristan Bruel,Davide Gerosa,Jonathan R. Gair",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the joint mass-redshift evolution of the binary black hole merger rate in the latest gravitational-wave detection catalog, GWTC-4.0. We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \sim 70\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshift ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger rate at high redshift $(z \sim 1)$ around those masses, compatible with such a peak. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these results.",
Cross submissions,Non-local mass superpositions and optical clock interferometry in atomic ensemble quantum networks,"Charles Fromonteil,Denis V. Vasilyev,Torsten V. Zache,Klemens Hammerer,Ana Maria Rey,Jun Ye,Hannes Pichler,Peter Zoller",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph),"Quantum networks are emerging as powerful platforms for sensing, communication, and fundamental tests of physics. We propose a programmable quantum sensing network based on entangled atomic ensembles, where optical clock qubits emulate mass superpositions in atom and atom-clock interferometry. Our approach uniquely combines scalability to large atom numbers with minimal control requirements, relying only on collective addressing of internal atomic states. This enables the creation of both non-local and local superpositions with spatial separations beyond those achievable in conventional interferometry. Starting from Bell-type seed states distributed via photonic channels, collective operations within atomic ensembles coherently build many-body mass superpositions sensitive to gravitational redshift. The resulting architecture realizes a non-local Ramsey interferometer, with gravitationally induced phase shifts observable in network-based interference patterns. Beyond extending the spatial reach of mass superpositions, our scheme establishes a scalable, programmable platform to probe the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity, and offers a new experimental pathway to test atom and atom-clock interferometer proposals in a network-based quantum laboratory.",
Cross submissions,Chronology Protection of Rotating Black Holes in a Viable Lorentz-Violating Gravity,"Mu-In Park,Hideki Maeda",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study causal properties of the recently found rotating black-hole solution in the low-energy sector of Horava gravity as a viable Lorentz-violating (LV) gravity in four dimensions with the LV Maxwell field and a cosmological constant $\Lambda (>-3/a^2)$ for an arbitrary rotation parameter $a$. The region of non-trivial causality violation containing closed timelike curves is exactly the same as in the Kerr-Newman or the Kerr-Newman-(Anti-)de Sitter solution. Nevertheless, chronology is protected in the new rotating black hole because the causality violating region becomes physically inaccessible by exterior observers due to the new three-curvature singularity at its boundary that is topologically two-torus including the usual ring singularity at $(r,\theta)=(0,\pi/2)$. As a consequence, the physically accessible region outside the torus singularity is causal everywhere.",
Cross submissions,Jet-driven explosion of an accretion-induced white-dwarf collapse via a magnetorotational dynamo,"Luciano Combi,Daniel M. Siegel,Brian D. Metzger",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a rotating white dwarf (WD) offers a potential site of millisecond pulsars/magnetars, gamma-ray bursts, and r-process nucleosynthesis. We present three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including neutrinos of magnetorotational AIC, assuming the WD is rapidly spinning with a weak magnetic field confined below its surface (likely a prerequisite for rapid rotation). Within milliseconds after core bounce, the magnetic field is exponentially amplified near the surface of the proto-neutron star (PNS). We witness the emergence of a small-scale turbulent and mean-field, large-scale MRI-driven dynamo in the neutrino-cooled centrifugally supported disk formed around the PNS, which generates bundles of large-scale toroidal field with alternating polarity. The amplified field becomes buoyant and is advected above the PNS, generating a magnetic tower that drives a mildly relativistic striped jet. The jet breaks out of the WD, clearing the way for a powerful magnetized neutron-rich wind from the disk. Although our simulation cannot follow the long-term Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase of the PNS, the conditions are ripe for the formation of a GRB powered by magnetar spin-down. A similar dynamo may operate in magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers.",
Cross submissions,Calibration-independent consistency test of DESI DR2 BAO and SNIa,"Bikash R. Dinda,Roy Maartens,Chris Clarkson",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the consistency between DESI DR2 BAO and three SNIa datasets, Pantheon+, Union3, and DES-Y5. Our consistency test is {calibration}-independent since it is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters such as the absolute peak magnitude $M_B$ and the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$. {This could reduce some systematics in the observed data, if present}. Importantly, the test is also model-agnostic, independent of any model of dark energy or modified gravity. We define a tension parameter to quantify tension across different datasets compared to DESI DR2 BAO. The Pantheon+ and Union3 data have tension $\lesssim\! 1\sigma$ across their redshift ranges, whereas the DES-Y5 tension is $\gtrsim3\sigma$ near $z=1$. This hints that DES-Y5 data has significant offset values for redshifts close to 1, compared to the other SNIa datasets. Since this consistency test is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters, the tension is minimal: other consistency tests involving differences in nuisance parameters may show greater tension.",
Cross submissions,Aspects of non-minimally coupled curvature with power laws,"Anamaria Hell,Dieter Lust",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider a class of theories containing power-law terms in both the Ricci scalar and a scalar field, including their non-minimal couplings. As a first step, we systematically classify all non-trivial cases with a propagating scalar field that arise from the simplest general power-law formulation, which contains the minimal number of terms. We then analyze each case in detail, focusing on the structure of the degrees of freedom, by both formulating the theories in the Einstein frames and focusing on the singular points in the Jordan frame. We demonstrate that such theories can give rise to different, and sometimes unexpected structure of the modes, that can change at the leading order depending on the background.",
Cross submissions,Vacuum Fluctuations and the Renormalized Stress-Energy Tensor on a Cone with Arbitrary Boundary Conditions,"Jo√£o Paulo M. Pitelli,Ricardo A. Mosna,Victor Hugo M. Ramos,Jo√£o C. A. Barata",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze the vacuum fluctuations and the stress-energy tensor of a scalar field of mass $M$ in a conical spacetime, where the topological singularity at the apex requires boundary conditions for the field equation. The necessity of boundary conditions was established by Kay and Studer in the early 1990s, but the consequences of their arbitrariness, represented here by a parameter $q$, for renormalized observables have not been examined. While for $M=0$ stability is achieved only under Dirichlet boundary conditions, for $M>q$ the field is stable and a localized mode emerges. This mode admits a natural interpretation as a covariant model of an extended particle detector, which allows us to investigate how such detectors modify the local vacuum structure. In this framework, the renormalized stress-energy tensor offers a natural way to quantify the influence of the detector on the surrounding spacetime.",
Cross submissions,An invisible extended Unruh-DeWitt detector,"Victor Hugo M. Ramos,Jo√£o Paulo M. Pitelli,Jo√£o C. A. Barata",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a localized particle detector model formulated as a massive quantum field on Minkowski spacetime with the spatial origin excised. To render the problem well-posed at the puncture, we impose boundary conditions at the excised point, which we take to be of Robin type. This setup yields a discrete sector, given by bound-state solutions of the radial equation with real, positive frequencies, which characterizes the detector. We construct the full two-point function and show its decomposition into: (i) the discrete radial bound-state sector, (ii) the boundary condition modified continuous sector, and (iii) the unmodified Dirichlet sector. We then compute the detector field's stress-energy tensor and prove its covariant conservation. For the specific localized modes in this setup, the discrete-sector contribution cancels in the complete stress-energy tensor, leaving only boundary-condition induced terms. Notably, the discrete modes crucial to localized field-based detectors emerge naturally from the boundary conditions, without ad hoc confining potentials, providing a fully relativistic framework that extends the traditional Unruh-DeWitt paradigm. This mechanism is not restricted to Minkowski spacetime: the same construction can be applied to massive fields on backgrounds with naked singularities, such as conical and global monopole spacetimes, offering a unified route to detector localization in a broad class of geometries.",
Cross submissions,"Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on $f(T,L_m)$ gravity","Daniel F.P. Cruz,David S. Pereira,Francisco S.N. Lobo,Jos√© P. Mimoso",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we investigate Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) within the framework of $f(T,{L}_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is generalized as a function of the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian ${L}_m$. We analyze three representative $f(T,{L}_m)$ models and derive constraints on their free parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, by combining observational bounds from the freeze-out temperature with the primordial abundances of deuterium, helium-4, and lithium-7. For each model, the parameter space consistent with all elemental $Z$-constraints and the freeze-out condition is determined. These results demonstrate that $f(T,{L}_m)$ modifications can accommodate the tight observational constraints of BBN, suggesting that minimal extensions to the matter sector provide viable alternatives to the standard cosmological description and offer a promising framework for exploring modified gravity in the early Universe.",
