New submissions,Dynamical Systems Analysis of an Einstein-Cartan Ekpyrotic Nonsingular Bounce Cosmology,Jackson Stingley,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"I construct an Einstein-Cartan ekpyrotic model (ECEM): a homogeneous, nearly Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background in Einstein-Cartan (EC) gravity whose spin-torsion sector, modeled phenomenologically as a Weyssenhoff fluid with stiff scaling $\propto a^{-6}$, is coupled to a scalar field with a steep exponential potential that interpolates between a negative ekpyrotic branch and a positive plateau. Extending the Copeland-Liddle-Wands (CLW) scalar-fluid dynamical system to a six-dimensional phase space including shear, curvature, and spin-torsion, I recast the equations in a compact deceleration-parameter form, compute the full Jacobian, and evaluate maximal Lyapunov exponents. Numerical solutions show that the ekpyrotic branch ($w_\phi\gg1$) exponentially damps homogeneous shear, while the softened branch ($w_\phi<1$) allows $\rho_s$ to overtake the scalar during contraction and trigger a torsion-supported bounce at high but finite densities where the EC spin-torsion term becomes dynamically dominant. Scans in a two-parameter softening plane $(\phi_{\rm b},\Delta)$ identify a finite region of nonsingular trajectories and quantify the required tuning; in the parameter ranges explored the maximal Lyapunov exponent on the constrained phase space is negative, giving no indication of chaotic behavior in this homogeneous truncation even when the usual curvature mode that destabilizes contracting General Relativity (GR) backgrounds is included. The construction is purely phenomenological and confined to homogeneous backgrounds: it does not address entropy accumulation, the cosmological arrow of time, or a complete cyclic cosmology.",
New submissions,Gravitational radiations from periodic orbits around a black hole in the effective field theory extension of general relativity,"Shuo Lu,Hao-Jie Lin,Tao Zhu,Yu-Xiao Liu,Xin Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The study of periodic orbits in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals is essential for understanding the dynamics of small bodies orbiting supermassive black holes. In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and their corresponding gravitational wave emissions within the framework of an effective field theory-based extension of general relativity (EFTGR), which incorporates higher-order curvature terms into the Einstein-Hilbert action. We start with a brief analysis of the modified black hole spacetime in EFTGR and examine how its parameters influence the dynamics of a massive neutral particle using the Lagrangian formalism. Focusing on the impact of the higher-order curvature terms in EFTGR, we examine the properties of periodic orbits, which are characterized by three topological integers $(z, w, v)$ that uniquely classify their trajectories. By analyzing these orbits within EFTGR, we aim to provide new insights into how strong-field deviations from general relativity may manifest in observable phenomena. We then calculate the gravitational waveforms generated by these periodic orbits, identifying potential observational signatures. Our analysis reveals a direct connection between the zoom-whirl orbital behavior of the small compact object and the gravitational waveforms it emits: higher zoom numbers lead to increasingly intricate waveform substructures. The results contribute to a clearer understanding of the dynamical features of EFTGR and open new avenues for probing black hole properties via gravitational wave detection.",
New submissions,Self-gravitating equilibrium with slow steady flow and the correct form of entropy current,Shuichi Yokoyama,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with spherical symmetry as well as with steady energy flow is investigated perturbatively around the hydrostatic limit, where the radial component of the fluid velocity field $u^\mu$ is sufficiently small. Each component of vectors and tensors consisting of the system is expanded in different powers, which makes the covariant perturbation approach ineffective. The differential equations to determine the subleading correction of the structure variables are presented. The system retains the current $j^\mu$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^\mu$ in such a general covariant form that $s^\mu=au^\mu+ bj^\mu$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^\mu=(s-bj^0)u^\mu/u^0+ bj^\mu$, where $s$ is the entropy density. The remaining parameter $b$ is fixed by the current conservation equation. The perturbative analysis shows that $b$ starts with the quadratic order and its leading term is determined explicitly.",
New submissions,Low finesse scattering and spectral drift of gravitational wave echoes,"Han-Wen Hu,Cheng-Jun Fang,Zong-Kuan Guo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational wave echoes serve as probes for quantum horizon corrections. While steady-state resonances are assumed in the search of gravitational wave echos, realistic barriers are expected to possess intrinsically low reflectivity. In this work, we investigate this low-finesse limit via time-domain simulations and demonstrate that early-time echoes behave as transient scattered wave packets rather than cavity eigenstates. A central finding is the identification of spectral drift, where the central frequency progressively redshifts. This evolution occurs because high-frequency components dissipate significantly faster than the fundamental mode due to the filtering effect of the potential barrier. To distinguish transient interference from genuine resonance, we establish a physical criterion based on cavity lifetime, identifying a critical reflectivity threshold of approximately $0.37$. Since theoretical models typically operate deep within the overdamped regime below this limit, the resulting signals are spectrally non-stationary. We propose that detection strategies should shift towards dynamic time-frequency tracking to capture these drifting signatures.",
New submissions,Nonconservative Lie series: post-Newtonian binary dynamics at 2.5PN,"Christopher Aykroyd,Adrien Bourgoin,Christophe Le Poncin-Lafitte",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a fully analytical solution to the dynamics of the non-spinning 2.5 post-Newtonian binary problem, accounting for both the long-term (secular) and short-term (oscillatory) temporal behavior, with no restriction on eccentricity. The radiative degrees of freedom are handled within the nonconservative Hamiltonian framework introduced in a companion paper. In this work, we apply the Lie series method to construct a resonant Birkhoff normal-form and the corresponding generator of the radiation-reaction dynamics. The secular piece reconstructs exactly the Peters-Mathews relations for semi-major axis and eccentricity. The oscillatory piece completes the dynamics and is well suited for gravitational wave templates. The procedure we present in this paper can be systematically employed to cast arbitrary nonconservative systems into extended Hamiltonian form so that the Lie method can be applied.",
New submissions,Born-Infeld signatures in AdS black hole thermodynamics and gravitational lensing,"Ekrem Aydıner,Tekin Dereli,İzzet Sakallı,Erdem Sucu,Ece Seyma Yörük",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of Einstein-Born-Infeld-Anti-de Sitter (EBI-AdS) black holes (BHs). Our study derives the Hawking temperature using standard surface gravity methods and examines quantum corrections through both the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and exponential entropy modifications, showing enhanced thermal radiation and potential remnant formation scenarios. The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $\eta \sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units. The plasma deflection analysis reveals frequency-dependent refractive modifications encoded in the plasma parameter, offering additional possible observational channels.",
New submissions,On visible effects in the double Schwarzschild solution,"Eddy de Leon,Joerg Frauendiener,Christian Klein",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Physical aspects of a static solution to the Einstein equationswith two black holes are studied via ray tracing. The exactsolution for this double Schwarzschild solution is known in explicit form. The black holes are separated by a singularity called \emph{Weyl strut}. The effect of this strut on null geodesics is shown to be defocusing in contrast to the focusing effect of the black holes. It is shown that black holes with a large separation essentially lead to similar behavior of the null geodesics as a single black hole, whereas nearby holes display a widely changed behavior due to the Weyl strut.",
New submissions,The macroscopic precession model: describing quasi-periodic oscillations including internal structures of test bodies,"Gabriele Bianchini,Orlando Luongo,Marco Muccino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"The relativistic precession model (RPM) is widely-considered as a benchmark framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), albeit several observational inconsistencies suggest that the model remains incomplete. The RPM ensures \emph{structureless test particles} and attributes precession to geodesic motion alone. Here, we refine the RPM by incorporating the internal structure of rotating test bodies, while preserving the test particle approximation (TPA), and propose a \emph{macroscopic precession model} (MPM) by means of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, applied to a Schwarzschild background, which introduces 1) a shift in the Keplerian frequency and 2) an \emph{effective spin correction} to the radial epicyclic frequency that, once the spin tensor is modeled, reproduces a quasi-Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) correction. We apply the MPM to eight neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs), performing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits to twin kHz QPOs and find observational and statistical evidence in favor of precise power law spin reconstructions. Further, our model accurately predicts the $3:2$ frequency clustering, the disk boundaries and the NS masses. From the MPM model, we thus conclude that complexity of QPOs can be fully-described including the test particle internal structure.",
New submissions,Geodesic structure of spacetime near singularities,"Mayank,Dawood Kothawala",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Geodesic flows emanating from an arbitrary point $\mathscr{P}$ in a manifold $\mathscr{M}$ carry important information about the geometric properties of $\mathscr{M}$. These flows are characterized by Synge's world function and van Vleck determinant - important bi-scalars that also characterize quantum description of physical systems in $\mathscr{M}$. If $\mathscr{P}$ is a regular point, these bi-scalars have well known expansions around their flat space expressions, quantifying \textit{local flatness} and equivalence principle. We show that, if $\mathscr{P}$ is a singular point, the scaling behavior of these bi-scalars changes drastically, capturing the non-trivial structure of geodesic flows near singularities. This yields remarkable insights into classical structure of spacetime singularities and provides useful tool to study their quantum structure.",
New submissions,Inflation with Gauss-Bonnet Correction and Higgs Potential,"Zahra Ahghari,Mehrdad Farhoudi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the cosmological inflation for the Einstein-Hilbert action plus the Higgs potential function and the Gauss-Bonnet term coupled with the Higgs scalar field through a dilaton-like coupling. Then, using the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric and considering the appropriate slow-roll parameters, we derive the necessary equations of motion. In the proposed model, since the e-folding integral cannot be easily solved analytically, we first utilize a well-known Taylor expansion. Then, with a certain range of values derived for the model parameters, utilizing a mixture of several diagrams and numerical analysis methods, we obtain results for the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the scalar spectral index that are in good agreement with observational data within the acceptable range of the e-folding values. Also, in the absence of the Gauss-Bonnet term, we find that the inflationary observables are roughly the same as the predictions of the chaotic inflation model.",
New submissions,Equation of the Perfect Fluid in the FRW Universe,"Shi-Bei Kong,Ying Wang,Yu-Ke Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we study the equation of state and its properties of the perfect fluid in the $D$-dimensional FRW universe under Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity and Lovelock gravity. In Einstein gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has no critical point in the $P$-$V$ diagram, but its isothermal lines have minima in the $4$-dimensional case and are always negative in higher dimensions. In Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has a critical point in the $5,6,7,8$-dimensional cases with phase transitions above the critical temperature. In Lovelock gravity, we get the equation of state and conditions of the critical points. Our work shows that both the theories of gravity and the dimensions of the FRW universe affect the existence of the critical point of the perfect fluid. Interestingly, if the critical point exists, phase transition always occures above the critical temperature.",
New submissions,Hybrid algorithm combining matched filtering and convolutional neural networks for searching gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers,"Takahiro S. Yamamoto,Kipp Cannon,Hayato Motohashi,Hiroaki W. H. Tahara",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Efficient searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence are crucial for gravitational wave observations. We present a proof-of-concept for a method that utilizes a neural network taking an SNR map, a stack of SNR time series calculated by the matched filter, as input and predicting the presence or absence of gravitational waves in observational data. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to a dataset of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass black hole mergers injected into stationary Gaussian noise. Our algorithm exhibits comparable performance to the standard matched-filter pipeline and to the machine-learning algorithms that participated in the mock data challenge, MLGWSC-1. The demonstration also shows that our algorithm achieves reasonable sensitivity with practical computational resources.",
New submissions,Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Spacetime and the Kerr/CFT Correspondence,Haryanto M. Siahaan,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We construct the Kerr/CFT correspondence for extremal Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (Kerr--BR) black holes, which are exact stationary solutions of the Einstein--Maxwell equations describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform Bertotti--Robinson electromagnetic universe. After reviewing the geometry, horizon structure, and thermodynamics of the Kerr--BR family, we demonstrate that the external field non-trivially modifies both the horizon positions and the extremality condition. For extremal configurations, the near-horizon limit yields a warped $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ geometry with an associated Maxwell field aligned to the $U(1)$ fibration. Imposing standard Kerr/CFT boundary conditions, the asymptotic symmetry algebra gives rise to a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_L$ and left-moving temperature $T_L$ that depend explicitly on the external field strength. The Cardy formula then reproduces exactly the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy of the extremal Kerr--BR black hole for any admissible value of the Bertotti--Robinson field, thereby establishing a consistent Kerr/CFT dual description. Comparisons with the magnetized Melvin--Kerr and Kaluza--Klein black holes are briefly discussed, highlighting qualitative differences in their curvature profiles and horizon geometries.",
New submissions,Matching the Alcubierre and Minkowski spacetimes,"Osvaldo L. Santos-Pereira,Everton M. C. Abreu,Marcelo B. Ribeiro",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work analyzes the Darmois junction conditions matching an interior Alcubierre warp drive spacetime to an exterior Minkowski geometry. The joining hypersurface requires that the shift vector of the warp drive spacetime must satisfy the solution of a particular inviscid Burgers equation, namely, the gauge where the shift vector is not a function of the $y$ and $z$ spacetime coordinates. Such a gauge connects the warp drive metric to shock waves via a Burgers-type equation, which was previously found to be an Einstein equations vacuum solution for the warp drive geometry. It is also shown that not all Ricci and Riemann tensors components are zero at the joining hypersurface, but for that to happen they depend on the shift vector solution of the inviscid Burgers equation at the joining wall. This means that the warp drive geometry is not globally flat.",
New submissions,Quasinormal modes and Grey body factors of Wormholes: From General prescription to Einstein Gauss Bonnet realizations,"Madhukrishna Chakraborty,Subenoy Chakraborty",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Traversable wormholes are one of the most exciting predictions of General Relativity that offer short-cuts through space-time. However, their feasibility requires the violation of the null energy condition and makes their detection a bit difficult. This paper aims to show the new avenues delving deep into the observational prospects of TWHs via quasinormal modes (QNMs) and gray body factors GBFs. These are the two elementary aspects of wave dynamics. Given their distinct spectral imprints, these features provide a potential means to distinguish wormholes from black holes in gravitational wave observations. The role of QNMs in characterizing the ringdown phase of perturbations and the GBFs in determining transmission probabilities through wormhole barriers have been explored by a general description and then fed to Einstein Gauss Bonnet WH solutions in isotropic as well as anisotropic cases. Finally, a correspondence of the QNM frequencies with radius of the WH shadows has been made and the effect of Gauss Bonnet parameter on the QNM spectra has been discussed.",
New submissions,Probing the gravity of a Schwarzschild black hole in the presence of a cloud of strings with EMRIs,"Mirzabek Alloqulov,Ahmadjon Abdujabbarov,Bobomurat Ahmedov,Chengxun Yuan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Here, we explore the effect of the cloud of strings (CoS) on the gravitational waveforms of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The EMRI system consists of a supermassive black hole (BH) and a compact stellar mass object moving around it. We begin with studying the test particle motion around the Schwarzschild BH surrounded by a CoS by using the Lagrangian formalism. Moreover, we investigated the effect of the CoS parameter on the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then turn to the exploration of the impact of the CoS parameter on the gravitational waveforms of the EMRI system. The analysis performed shows that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could detect the CoS imprint in gravitational waveforms when the values of the string cloud parameter $\alpha \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{-6}$.",
New submissions,A parameterized equation of state for dark energy and Hubble Tension,"Jing-Ya Zhao,Tong-Yu He,Jia-Jun Yin,Zhan-Wen Han,Rong-Jia Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a parameterized equation of state for dark energy and perform observational tests with the Hubble parameter measurements, the Pantheon supernova sample, baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESI DR2 data. We obtain the best-fit values for the parameters as: $H_0=73.96\pm 0.16$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.2434\pm 0.0079$, and $\alpha=-0.00049\pm 0.00092$, demonstrating that the model exhibits a high degree of consistency with astronomical observations and provides a promising parameterized method for addressing the Hubble tension.",
New submissions,Spherical symmetric fields on torsion-free Palatini Gauss-Bonnet theory,"Máximo Bañados,Daniela Bennett",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Gauss-Bonnet density `a la Palatini' is not a total derivative in four dimensions. We study spherically symmetric fields for the torsion-free theory. The resulting equations are highly complicated but we show the existence of unexpected hidden gauge symmetries, beyond diffeomorphisms and Weyl transformations.",
New submissions,Extracting the expression for the field equations of a diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity from surface term,Jun-Jin Peng,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"As a contribution towards the understanding for the field equations of diffeomorphism invariant theories of pure gravity, we demonstrate in great detail that the expression for the field equations of such theories can be derived within the perspective of the surface term coming from the variation of the Lagrangian. Specifically, starting with the surface term, we extract a symmetric rank-two tensor together with an anti-symmetric one out of this term with the variation operator replaced with the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. By utilizing an equality stemming from the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian density along an arbitrary vector field, it is proved that the resulting symmetric rank-two tensor is identified with the functional derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric. Such a result further brings forth the expression for the field equations constructed from the symmetric rank-two tensor, which naturally rules out the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric and coincides with the one for the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the construction of the expression for the field equations from the symmetric rank-two tensor must be feasible as long as the variation operator in the variation equation of the Lagrangian is allowed to be substituted by the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. On the other hand, as a byproduct, the anti-symmetric rank-two tensor turns out to be the Noether charge two-form. Our results offer a straightforward support on the proposal in our previous work that the surface term gives a unified description for field equations and Noether charges in the context of theories of gravity admitting diffeomorphism invariance symmetry.",
New submissions,On the magnetic 2+1- D space-time and its non-relativistic counterpart,Sayan Kumar Pal,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present here an interesting non-relativistic limit, referred to as the Newton-Hooke (NH) limit, of the purely magnetic BTZ solution by starting from the Einstein-Maxwell system in the 2+1 dimensions. The Newton-Hooke limit is different from the Galilean limit in the sense that the former contains an additional parameter {\Lambda}, the cosmological constant, over and above the speed of light, c. We show that under this limit, the geodesics of the magnetic BTZ solution reduce to the two-dimensional motion of a charged particle in a normal magnetic field together with the presence of an extra harmonic potential, sometimes called the Fock-Darwin problem, which serves as a precursor to model certain condensed matter theories. Our present study has significance in analyzing the symmetries of different dynamical systems, from relativistic and/to nonrelativistic theories. Also, we discuss here one of the applications of the generalized (magnetic) NH_3 symmetry in the context of the Virial theorem, where this symmetry is the symmetry group of the Fock-Darwin problem mentioned above.",
New submissions,Shadow and Optical Imaging in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Black Hole,"Junlin Qin,Hong-Er Gong,Yusen Wang,Zhan-Feng Mai,Bofeng Wu,Sen Guo,Enwei Liang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper investigates photon motion in black hole of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, exploring black hole shadows and observational characteristics under various accretion models. We first give the relation of the event horizon, photon sphere, and critical impact parameter in terms of the magnetic charge $q$. We then use the Event Horizon Telescope data to constrain $q$. For the two spherical accretion models, the infalling scenario yields a darker shadow due to the Doppler effect. However, the shadow radius remains unchanged for different models. In the case of an optically thin, geometrically thin disk accretion model, the observed brightness is predominantly determined by direct emission. The lensing ring provides a secondary contribution to the intensity, whereas the photon ring's emission is negligible. The widths of the lensing and photon rings exhibit a positive correlation with the magnetic charge $q$. Additionally, within the disk model framework, the black hole shadow radius is found to depend on the specific emission model.",
New submissions,Through the Singularity,"Michael Heller,Tomasz Miller,Wiesław Sasin",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In this work, we propose a dangerous journey -- a journey through the strong singularity from one universe to another or from inside of a black hole to its 'inverse' as a white hole. Such singularities are hidden in the Friedman and Schwarzschild solutions; we call them malicious singularities. The journey is made possible owing to two generalizations. The first generalization consists in considering spaces with differential structures on them (the so-called ringed spaces) rather than the usual manifolds. This entails a generalization of the concept of smoothness, which allows us to think about a smooth passage through the singularity. The second generalization is related to the concept of curve. We show that if a kind of singularity is implanted in the set of curve's parameters, along with an appropriate topology, in such a way that the structure of the set of parameters corresponds to the structure of the singular space-time, the curve can smoothly -- in a generalized sense -- pass through the singularity.",
New submissions,Shadows of rotating traversable wormholes surrounded by plasma,"Tsanimir Angelov,Rasim Bekir,Galin Gyulchev,Petya Nedkova,Stoytcho Yazadjiev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the influence of the plasma environment on the shadows of stationary axisymmetric wormholes. We consider a sample of several wormhole solutions and plasma distributions for which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the light rays is separable. This allows us to derive analytical expressions for the shadow boundary and examine the behavior of the photon regions as the plasma frequency varies. We observe that plasma profiles which depend only on radial coordinate lead to common evolution of the photon region which does not depend on the wormhole metric and is consistent with the Kerr black hole. For plasma profiles with angular dependence the evolution of the photon region is specific for every spacetime thus wormholes are observationally distinguishable. We further investigate the formation of forbidden regions in the plasma medium where light cannot propagate. They lead to the formation of plasma frequency ranges where the shadow is no longer observable and we show that this phenomenon is characteristic for all the configurations in our sample. We obtain the critical frequencies for which the shadow vanishes and demonstrate that for all the wormholes they are lower than the critical frequencies for the Kerr black hole in the same environment. This implies that there exist plasma frequency ranges in which the Kerr black hole casts a shadow but wormholes do not, creating a strong observational signature for discriminating between compact objects. In the frequency ranges where both black hole and wormhole shadows exist the wormhole shadows are consistently smaller than those for the Kerr black hole. As the plasma frequency grows the discrepancy progresses showing that plasma medium facilitates the experimental detection of wormholes. Finally we consider aberrational effects on the wormhole shadows. They further increase the deviation from black holes making wormholes easier to detect.",
New submissions,Thermodynamic analysis of a compact object in Rastall-Rainbow gravity,"Sareh Eslamzadeh,Saheb Soroushfar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of a horizonless compact object within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow (RR) gravity. Working with local shell thermodynamics for gravastar and an exterior fiducial temperature, we show that the RR modification bends temperature to produce two extrema and a stable mass remnant at zero temperature. We show that the gravastar's shell entropy is smaller than that of a comparable black hole, and that RR modifications introduce a logarithmic correction which contributes to specific heat positivity and a smoother free energy landscape of small gravastars.A Central finding of this work is that, from heat capacity and Helmholtz free energy analyses, we uncover small, middle, and large branches and demonstrate that unlike Rainbow modified black holes, the small RR gravastar is both locally and globally favored over hot curved space. At the parameter level, both Rastall and Rainbow play distinct roles. Increasing the Rastall parameter, by strengthening matter-curvature coupling, adjusts the redshift between the shell and the exterior, shifts the temperature maximum to higher values at larger masses, and narrows the unstable window. In contrast, increasing the Rainbow parameter enhances energy dependent UV suppression and bends the temperature in lower values at larger masses. Altogether, these results highlight a controlled route to thermodynamic stabilization and the emergence of a stable remnant in horizonless compact objects within RR gravity.",
New submissions,Quantum Correlations and Gravity: From the Emergence of a Cosmological Constant to the Gravitation of Particles in Superposition,"Johas Morales,Yuri Bonder",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"One of the main technical obstacles in constructing a consistent theory of quantum gravity is that the metric itself defines the causal structure required for quantization. This motivates implementing quantum aspects of gravity through an independent connection. Moreover, the experimentally confirmed violation of Bell inequalities, together with the natural structure of the energy--momentum tensor in semiclassical gravity, suggests that nonlocality should be incorporated into the gravitational formalism. Motivated by these considerations, we propose a model in which the connection is treated as an independent bitensorial field, leading to a bitensorial generalization of the Einstein equations. The model reduces to General Relativity when the matter source is classical. We apply it in two regimes: the late-time universe and the Newtonian limit. In the cosmological case, the model naturally gives rise to a positive effective cosmological constant. In the Newtonian regime, we analyze a situation in which the gravitational source is in a quantum superposition and find that the model predicts a novel, nonconservative effective force that depends on the velocity of the test particle.",
New submissions,Silencing Newtonian noise using fusion sensor arrays,"Paul Ophardt,Francesca Badaracco,Katharina-Sophie Isleif",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Newtonian noise (NN) from seismic density fluctuations is expected to limit the low-frequency sensitivity of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, in particular the Einstein Telescope (ET). Current NN mitigation relies on seismometer arrays and Wiener filtering, while distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) offers a complementary, low-cost means of obtaining dense strain measurements. We investigate fusion sensor arrays composed of both displacement-measuring seismometers and strain-measuring DAS-type sensors. We extend the Wiener filter formalism to mixed sensor types and introduce analytic S-wave strain correlation coefficients. Using a hybrid differential evolution and covariance matrix adaptation scheme, we validate our approach against established seismometer-only results and analyze the geometry, robustness, and performance of optimized fusion arrays. Fusion arrays enhance P/S-wave disentanglement and achieve NN cancellation levels comparable to, and sometimes exceeding, those of seismometer-only arrays, particularly for small sensor numbers. When sensors are constrained to the ET infrastructure, we find that six seismometers complemented by fourteen strainmeters inside the ET arms can match the performance of twenty seismometers in boreholes, achieving a residual at the 10% level, and thereby offering a cost-efficient pathway toward ET-scale NN mitigation.",
New submissions,Could a thin-shell configuration lie hidden within the Universe?,"Mauricio Cataldo,Antonella Cid,Pedro Labraña",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This article explores the cosmological scenario in which our Universe contains a hidden thin-shell configuration. We investigate a degenerate modification of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric obtained through a coordinate transformation applied to the radial coordinate, analogous to recent approaches that address the Big Bang singularity via spacetime defects. The resulting metric, while formally satisfying the standard homogeneous Friedmann equations, actually describes an evolving wormhole geometry with two asymptotically flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker regions connected by a throat located at the coordinate singularity. Using Israel's junction formalism, we demonstrate that this coordinate singularity corresponds to a thin shell characterized by exotic matter with well-defined surface energy density and isotropic pressure. The shell obeys the barotropic equation of state $p = -\rho/2$, confirming the presence of exotic matter that violates the standard energy condition, which is a requirement for maintaining wormhole geometries. As the universe expands, this thin shell becomes increasingly diluted, scaling as $1/a(t)$ with the cosmic scale factor.",
New submissions,Resonances in the early Universe,"D. L. Canedo,G. Oliveira-Neto,G. A. Monerat,E.V. Corrêa Silva",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the present paper, we study a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) quantum cosmology model with positively curved spatial sections. The matter content of the model is given by a radiation fluid, a Chaplygin gas, and an ad hoc potential. After writing the Hamiltonian of the model, we notice that the effective potential ($V_{eff}$) depends on three parameters: $A$ and $B$ associated with the Chaplygin gas, and $\sigma$ associated with the ad hoc potential. Depending on the values of these parameters $V_{eff}$ becomes a double barrier potential. We quantize the model and obtain the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We solve that equation using the WKB approximation and compute the corresponding probability ($TP_{WKB}$) that the wavefunction of the universe tunnels through the double barrier potential $V_{eff}$. We study how $TP_{WKB}$ behaves as a function of the parameters $A$, $B$, $\sigma$ and the radiation energy $E$. We notice a significant occurrence of resonances in $TP_{WKB}$ when varying it as a function of $E$ or $\sigma$. It is a very interesting phenomenon because it may cause the universe to be born with selected values of $E$ or $\sigma$.",
New submissions,Two-point correlators in de Sitter-prepared states with bra-ket wormholes,"Sunghoon Jung,Minju Kum,Junghwan Lee",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Motivated by the finiteness of de Sitter (dS) horizon entropy, we study how ``bra-ket wormholes'' modify correlation functions in gravitationally prepared states. Euclidean wormhole saddles in gravitational path integrals can generate non-factorizing contributions to correlation functions, as in replica-wormhole explanation of the Page curve and bra-ket-wormhole restoration of strong subadditivity. By defining `time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find a late-time transition in the dominant saddle, accompanied by ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling. Our results are built upon (i) inflationary horizon exit and re-entry, (ii) enhancement of correlation at small comoving momentum $k$ by wormhole contribution, and (iii) a competition between mode counting and topological suppression that drives a transition to wormhole dominance. Although results are qualitatively consistent, one needs to address wormhole stabilization to clearly interpret in terms of the entropy context.",
New submissions,Schrödinger Symmetry in Spherically-symmetric Static Mini-superspaces with Matter Fields,"Taishi Sano,Yuki Yokokura",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Schrödinger symmetry emerged in a ``fluid limit"" from a full superspace to several mini-superspace models. We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schrödinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schrödinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior"", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schrödinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schrödinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schrödinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory. These support the robustness of the emergence of Schrödinger symmetry and open new possibilities for exploring quantum dynamics of matter and gravity based on the symmetry.",
Cross submissions,Completeness from Gravitational Scattering,"Francesco Calisto,Clifford Cheung,Grant N. Remmen,Francesco Sciotti,Michele Tarquini",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We prove that symmetry in the presence of gravity implies a version of the completeness hypothesis. For a broad class of theories, we demonstrate that the existence of finitely many charged particles logically necessitates the existence of infinitely many charged particles populating the entire charge lattice. Our conclusions follow from the consistency of perturbative gravitational scattering and require the following ingredients: 1) a weakly coupled ultraviolet completion of gravity, 2) a nonabelian symmetry $G$, gauged or global, whose Cartan subgroup generates the abelian charge lattice, and 3) a spectrum containing some finite set of charged representations, in the simplest cases taken to be a single particle in the fundamental. Under these conditions, the abelian charge lattice is completely filled by single-particle states for $G=SO(N)$ with $N\geq 5$ and $G=SU(N)$ with $N\geq 3$, which in turn implies completeness for other symmetry groups such as $Spin(N)$, $Sp(N)$, and $E_8$. Curiously, a corollary of our results is that the $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ grand unified theories have precisely the minimal field content needed to derive completeness using our methodology.",

As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions. At present, no dedicated facility or coordinated survey is planned to deliver electromagnetic follow-up at the scale necessary to maximise the science return of the millihertz gravitational-wave data; this white paper discusses the need and requirements of such a capability.",
Cross submissions,On the gravitational partition function under volume constraints,"Shan-Ping Wu,Peng Cheng,Shao-Wen Wei",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Euclidean action serves as a bridge between gravitational thermodynamics and the partition function. In this work, we further examine the gravitational partition function under a fixed volume constraint, extending the fixed volume on-shell geometry in the massless case. Moving beyond this massless configuration, we construct solutions with nonzero mass functions, leading to a new class of volume-constrained Euclidean geometries (VCEGs). The VCEG contains both a boundary and a horizon, and its Euclidean action is determined solely by the contribution from the horizon. However, further investigation suggests that this boundary appears to be artificially constructed and can be extended, giving rise to the extended VCEGs. These geometries feature two horizons, each with a conical singularity, and their action is given by one-quarter of the sum of the areas of the two horizons. In general, the conical singularities on both horizons cannot be simultaneously removed, except at a critical mass $m = m^*$, which defines the critical extended VCEG. Configurations with conical singularities are interpreted as constrained gravitational instantons. An analysis of their contributions to the partition function and topology reveals a close analogy between the extended VCEGs and the Euclidean Schwarzschild-de Sitter static patch, suggesting that the volume constraint effectively plays a role akin to that of a cosmological constant in semiclassical quantum gravity.",
Cross submissions,The tunneling decay rate in QFT beyond the thin wall approximation,G. Flores-Hidalgo,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The tunneling decay rate per unit volume in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), at order $\hbar$, is given by $\Gamma/V = Ae^{-B}$, where $B$ is the Euclidean action evaluated at the so-called bounce, and $A$ is proportional to the determinant of a second-order differential operator. The dominant contribution comes from the exponential factor. To estimate $\Gamma/V$, one must determine the bounce configuration, which satisfies a highly nonlinear equation. A common approach in the literature is the thin-wall approximation. In this work, we extend the formalism to cases where the thin-wall approximation is not valid. We employ a simple variational method to estimate both the bounce and the decay rate, and we find good agreement between our results and full numerical calculations.",
Cross submissions,New Massless Spectra from Cosmic String Cusps,"Amelia Drew,Ivan Rybak",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the standard picture of cosmic strings, cusps are generic features of Nambu-Goto loops where the string momentarily reaches the speed of light. They have a characteristic sharp profile, following $y \sim x^{2/3}$ in the $(x,y)$ plane, and produce strong gravitational-wave (GW) bursts with frequency-domain strain $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-4/3}$, making them key targets for current and future GW searches. However, under certain conditions, this generic picture can differ. We identify cusp solutions with different, including smooth, shapes, and compute their massless GW and axion spectra. We derive a general expression for all possible Nambu-Goto cusp spectra with the asymptotic form $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-n/(2n-1)} \omega^{-m/(2m-1)}$ where $n, m\geq 2$. We investigate the effect of realistic corrections to the Nambu-Goto description, such as those from backreaction and finite string width, which introduce a high frequency cutoff.",
Cross submissions,The Effect of a Self-bound Equation of State on the Structure of Rotating Compact Stars,Andreas Konstantinou,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper investigates how a self bound equation of state (EOS), which describes strange quark stars, affects the rotational properties of compact stars, focusing on deviations from universal relations governing gravitational mass and radius changes due to rotation. The analysis reveals significant deviations in stars with higher surface-to-center total energy-density ratios, $\frac{\epsilon_s}{\epsilon_c+c^2P_c}$, challenging the established universal relations.For Newtonian stars, hydrostatic equilibrium ensures that the difference between the gravitational potential at the center, $\Phi_c$, and at the poles, $\Phi_p$, remains constant within sequences of rotating neutron stars characterized by the same central and polar specific enthalpy ($\Phi_c - \Phi_p = -h_c +h_p$). Combined with the scaling $\Phi \propto R_e^2$, where $R_e$ denotes the equatorial radius, this condition naturally leads to a quasi-universal behavior in the rotational change of radius within these sequences. Similarly, in general relativistic stars, the hydrostatic equilibrium maintains that $\Phi^{GR}_{p} - \Phi^{GR}_{c}$ remains unchanged within these sequences, where $\Phi^{GR}$ is one of the metric potentials.Inspired by this theoretical framework, a toy model has been developed to capture the dependence of gravitational mass and radius deviations on the surface-to-central total energy density ratio. Subsequently, an improved set of empirical universal relations has been proposed, for accurately modeling rapidly rotating compact stars with self-bound EOSs.",
Cross submissions,Relativistic Dispersion Spectra across Lorentz boosted frames: Spurious modes and the enigma of causality,"Sayantani Bhattacharyya,Sukanya Mitra,Shuvayu Roy,Rajeev Singh",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"The analysis of linearized perturbations in relativistic field theories involving derivative corrections frequently leads to pathologies that, although generic, may not always be manifest, like in a local rest frame scenario. Hence, analyzing such theories conclusively in a more general state of equilibrium, like in a Lorentz boosted inertial frame, is imperative, albeit extracting the boosted modes could be quite nontrivial. Motivated by this problem, in this study, we develop a general framework for deriving the dispersion spectra in Lorentz-boosted inertial frames solely from the information of the local rest frame dispersion coefficients. Apart from the well-behaved modes, which are observed to follow an exact mapping across the boost, we show that in some cases, unphysical ``spurious"" modes might turn up, which diverge at zero boost limit and thus lack any rest-frame analogue. Finally, we investigate the conflict between the existence of these spurious modes and the causality for a given relativistic theory. The key developments provided here are (i) a convenient way for obtaining the dispersion spectra across inertial frames, bypassing the traditional method of solving the boosted polynomial, and (ii) exploring the direct connection between the mode conservation and the causality of a theory with detailed proof. Due to the general approach, these results can find direct applications for a range of other effective theory formulations, like gauge theory plasmas, strongly coupled systems, and heavy quark effective theory.",
Cross submissions,AttenGW: A Lightweight Attention-Based Multi-Detector Gravitational-Wave Detection Pipeline,"Victoria Tiki,Eliu Huerta",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present AttenGW, an attention-based multi-detector gravitational-wave detection model and accompanying software stack designed for analysis of real LIGO data. AttenGW combines a per-detector hierarchical dilated convolutional network with an attention-based aggregation module that enforces cross-detector coherence, providing an alternative to graph-based aggregation schemes used in previous work. The pipeline adopts a LIGO-style preprocessing and data-loading workflow based on GWOSC time series, with standard whitening and filtering, and is released as a documented Python/PyTorch package. We benchmark AttenGW using simulated injections to estimate sensitive volume and on real O3 data, focusing on the February 2020 segment previously used to evaluate a spatiotemporal graph ensemble. On this month of data, a single AttenGW model reduces the false-positive rate relative to a single graph-based detector by a factor of a few, and an ensemble of three AttenGW models matches the performance of the corresponding six-model ensemble. Injection studies on real LIGO noise further indicate that attention-based aggregation yields stable performance on non-Gaussian backgrounds.",
Cross submissions,Constraint on magnetized black bounce spacetime from HFQPOs data and the selection of resonance models via information criterion,"Shining Yang,Jianbo Lu,Mou Xu,Yu Liu",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper primarily explores the dynamics of charged particle in the magnetized SV spacetime, and constrains the parameters of the SV spacetime along with its surrounding magnetic fields. The constraints are given by using $\chi^2$ analysis combined with high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) data observed from three microquasars: GRS 1915+105, XTE 1550-564, and GRO J1655-40. The results indicate that the magnetic field significantly influences the position of the innermost stable circular orbit of charged particle and frequency distribution of epicyclic motion, which excites more resonance model variants, enhancing observational effects. Additionally, we employ the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate resonance model and its various variants. The support for different models from observational data shows significant variation: $E R_8$ as the best model is supported strongly, $ER_3$ model has moderate evidence of support, $ER_6$ and $ER_7$ models are considerably less support, while other resonance models have essentially no support. For models more supported by the observational data, the allowed ranges of the regularization parameter: $0\leq a<0.736$ ($68\%$ confidence level) suggests that HFQPOs data support the magnetized black bounce spacetime as a regular black hole, and the smaller value of the regularization parameter indicates a possibility of the presence of quantum effects. According to the constraint results, we get the best-fit values of magnetic field strength around $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-4}$ GS for electrons and around $10^{-2}\sim 10^{-1}$ GS for protons. Finally, as a comparison, we test the SV spacetime without a magnetic field using microquasar observational data, and the calculated results of AIC show that this case is incompatible with the HFQPOs data, further supporting the existence of a magnetic field in SV spacetime.",
Cross submissions,Universal Supercritical Behavior in Global Monopole-Charged AdS Black Holes,"Ankit Anand,Shoucheng Wang",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analytically investigate the Widom line and universal supercritical crossover for charged AdS black holes threaded by a global monopole. We compute thermodynamic variables in both the extended and canonical ensembles. We derive the scaled variance $\Omega$ using the Gibbs free energy and locate the Widom line as the extrema of this. Using mean-field expansion of the equation of state near criticality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L_\pm$. We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles. We also verify this with numerical computation and show the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L_\pm$.",
Cross submissions,Holographic Codes from Enriched Link Entanglement in Spin Networks,"Mai Qi,Eugenia Colafranceschi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We introduce an enriched entanglement structure for spin networks, inspired by tensor-network constructions, in which internal links can carry a controlled and discrete amount of entanglement. In the spin-network picture, vertices are dual to simplices and links are dual to their faces. Standard spin-network gluing corresponds to fully identifying two simplices along a face, implemented by a maximally entangled, gauge-invariant singlet state on the corresponding link, while unglued faces correspond to links carrying no entanglement. Working on a complete graph, we promote this binary choice to a controlled and tunable structure by allowing each link to carry a variable amount of entanglement, interpolating between product states and the fully entangled singlet. The additional link variables therefore control not only the amount of entanglement but also the extent to which gauge invariance at internal links is preserved or broken, admitting an interpretation in terms of emergent edge-mode-like degrees of freedom. Within this framework, spin-network contraction defines a bulk-to-boundary map from link-entanglement data to boundary states. Adapting techniques developed in random tensor networks, we show that in a suitable large-spin regime the map is a co-isometry in expectation value. Restricting to a code subspace defined by configurations in which links are either effectively glued or open, with small fluctuations around this pattern, the map becomes an exact isometry. This yields a discrete and geometrically meaningful realization of holographic and error-correcting features within the spin-network Hilbert space.",
Cross submissions,Measurement-Induced Perturbations of Hausdorff Dimension in Quantum Paths,"You-Wei Ding,Yen Chin Ong,Hao Xu",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In a seminal paper, Abbott et al. analyzed the relationship between a particle's trajectory and the resolution of position measurements performed by an observer at fixed time intervals. They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales.",
Cross submissions,Thermodynamic geometry of charged AdS black holes with a string cloud in Lorentz-violating Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity,"Faizuddin Ahmed,Edilberto O. Silva",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the thermodynamic microstructure of electrically charged AdS black holes in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity in the presence of a spherically symmetric cloud of strings. Employing Weinhold and Ruppeiner thermodynamic geometries in complementary thermodynamic representations, we show that curvature singularities consistently track the spinodal boundaries and the second-order critical point associated with a Van der Waals-like small/large black-hole phase transition. Moreover, the sign structure of the Ruppeiner curvature provides a transparent characterization of the competing microscopic interactions across the coexisting phases. We find that the Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$ and the string-cloud parameter $\alpha$ shift the critical scales and rescale correlation measures while preserving the universality class of the critical behavior. We further comment on dynamical and holographic implications and contrast the thermodynamic sensitivity to $(\ell,\alpha)$ with thin-disk optical signatures.",
Cross submissions,"Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$β$ active galactic nuclei using time-averaged radius$-$luminosity relations with 5100\,Å\,, broad H$β$, and narrow \OIII\ luminosities","Shulei Cao,Amit Kumar Mandal,Michal Zajaček,Bharat Ratra",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been studied as alternate probes in cosmology due to their large and stable luminosities and broad redshift range. Previously it was shown that higher-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped (RM) using broad Mg\,\textsc{ii} and C\,\textsc{iv} lines are standardizable and yield weak cosmological constraints that are consistent with those from better-established probes. In contrast, lower-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped using the broad H$\beta$ line exhibited tensions with the standard cosmological model, in particular they preferred currently decelerating cosmological expansion. Here we study the standardizability of a homogeneous RM H$\beta$ sample of $\sim 100$ AGN (over redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$), whose H$\beta$ time delays and three luminosity tracers (at 5100\,Å\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}]) are averaged over several epochs. We find that this averaged sample is standardizable using three $R-L$ relations. While for luminosities corresponding to 5100\,Å\, and the broad H$\beta$ line the cosmological constraints prefer currently decelerating cosmological expansion, the cosmological parameters for the narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}] luminosity are more consistent with those from better-established probes and they are in agreement with currently accelerating cosmological expansion. This demonstrates for the first time that narrow-line region [O\,\textsc{iii}] can be utilized for AGN standardization and cosmological constraints. Selecting proper photoionizing flux proxies for the broad-line region is thus crucial in studies of RM AGN standardizability.",

The on-shell effective field theory comprises five parity-even and three parity-odd independent six-derivative scalar-tensor interactions, representing all inequivalent deformations consistent with general covariance. We further confirm this operator counting through an independent analysis using the scattering amplitude formalism in four-dimensional flat spacetime. The six-derivative Lagrangian constructed here provides the next-to-leading-order extension of scalar-tensor gravity, furnishing a robust framework for exploring quantum or stringy corrections, parity-violating interactions, and strong-curvature effects in cosmology, black hole physics and gravitational wave observations.",
Cross submissions,The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension,"Adam Smith,Maria Mylova,Carsten van de Bruck,C.P. Burgess,Eleonora Di Valentino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.",
Cross submissions,The impact of non-Gaussianity when searching for Primordial Black Holes with LISA,"Antonio Junior Iovino,Gabriele Perna,Hardi Veermäe",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"LISA can observe cosmological millihertz (mHz) gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds that may offer a decisive test for asteroid-mass primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM). In standard scenarios, failing to detect a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background would exclude the last viable window for PBH DM formed through critical collapse. We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA's capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window.",
