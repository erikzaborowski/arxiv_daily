New submissions,Field theory vacuum and entropic dark energy models,Michael Maziashvili,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the cosmological implications of a novel definition of field theory vacuum energy. The free field Hamiltonian represented as an ensemble of oscillators (in the Fourier space) usually implies the presence of mass scale for these oscillators, which in quantum field theory is of little importance since quantum energy spectrum of oscillator is mass independent. This mass scale, however, may be interesting due to its possible gravitational implications. Since black hole physics puts an upper limit on the total energy within a given region, one obtains constraint on the number of field oscillators. If the mass scale for field oscillators is set by the IR cutoff, then this number saturates the black hole entropy bound. Following this reasoning, one derives various kinds of dark energy models that maybe interesting for further study.",
New submissions,Deriving the Cosmological Constant and Nature's Constants from SU(3) Confinement Volume,"Malak Ali,Ahmed Farag Ali",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore the interplay between three well-established physical principles: QCD confinement, the Third Law of Thermodynamics, and holography, and examine how their combined implications may shed light on several open problems in fundamental physics. As the Universe cools toward absolute zero, color confinement fragments the vacuum into proton-scale domains. The Third Law, which renders $T = 0$ unattainable and prohibits complete entropy elimination, implies that these domains must persist. This leads to a natural count $N \simeq (R_u / R_p)^3 \sim 10^{123}$, where $R_u$ is the radius of the cosmic horizon and $R_p$ is the proton radius. Assuming holographic saturation, each domain corresponds to a Planck-area patch on the cosmic horizon, allowing the Planck length, and hence $\hbar$, $G$, and $c$, to emerge as geometric quantities. The same tiling dilutes the bare Planck-scale vacuum energy by a factor of $N$, reproducing the observed value of $\rho_\Lambda$ without requiring fine-tuned counterterms.",
New submissions,Kerr Black Holes in an Expanding Bubble,Marco Astorino,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity, describing a collinear array of an arbitrary number of Kerr black holes inside an expanding bubble of nothing is built, thanks to the inverse scattering technique. Physical properties and thermodynamics of the single Kerr in the bubble are studied. No cosmic strings or struts are present. The binary black hole system displays equilibrium configurations, because the expanding bubble surrounding the black holes balances the mutual gravitational attraction of the two constituents.",
New submissions,Quantifying Systematic Biases in Black Hole Spectroscopy,"Sebastian H. VÃ¶lkel,Arnab Dhani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"How long after the merger of two black holes can one rely on linear perturbation theory, and how many quasinormal modes are in the ringdown? Such questions suggest that black hole spectroscopy suffers from systematic uncertainties that potentially spoil ringdown analyses, both from high-accuracy simulations and in data from gravitational wave detectors. In this work, we demonstrate that linear-signal analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying biases, allowing for detailed explorations that are computationally too expensive for traditional Bayesian injection and recovery approaches. We quantify the validity of the Fisher information matrix and bias formula by comparing it to robust but slow Bayesian sampling. Working with flat noise in the time domain, statistical errors and systematic biases can mostly be detected analytically. Due to its efficiency, we provide detailed parameter space analyses for potentially unmodeled small contributions from overtones, quadratic modes, and tails. We find linear signal analysis well suited for predicting biases in simple ringdown models at intermediate SNRs of order 50 when unmodeled effects are small. It is also valuable in explaining ongoing issues in extracting quasinormal modes from high-precision simulations, as one can understand them as high-SNR signals. Therefore, this approach offers promising prospects for improving ringdown models by efficiently identifying and incorporating systematic uncertainties, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and robustness of black hole spectroscopy.",
New submissions,High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation,Slava G. Turyshev,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5x10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in low lunar orbits, at the Earth-Moon L1 point and in near-rectilinear halo orbits. Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are required to achieve 5x10^{-18} fractional stability, supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation in cislunar space. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.",
New submissions,Constraints on multi-fluid cosmology in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity models with different observational data sets,"Praveen Kumar Dhankar,Albert Munyeshyaka,Aritra Sanyal,Safiqul Islam,Farook Rahaman",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the present work, we incorporate redshift-space distortion measurement to investigate the growth of large scale structure within the framework of multi-fluid cosmology in the context of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Using three different modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity models, we compare the predictions of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity expansion history-through the Friedmann equation with Hubble and BAO data sets and constrain models parameters. Within the context of multi-fluid cosmology in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain the structure growth equation. This equation is then combined with Sigma_8 to get f_Sigma_8 predictions-which is compared with redshift-space distortion data to constrain models parameters to obtain best-fit values including Sigma_8. This involves performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for these specific forms of modified Gauss-Bonnet models.",
New submissions,Resonant interactions from dynamical perturbers on generic orbits around an extreme mass ratio inspiral,"Makana Silva,Harrison G. Blake-Goszyk,Christopher M. Hirata",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are binary systems where a compact object slowly inspirals into its much larger compact partner. Since we anticipate such systems to exist within and be dynamically influenced by the galactic center environment, we expect them to be instrumental in studying these environments and testing our theories of gravity in the strong field regime. The gravitational waves associated with the EMRI motion fall within the mHz regime, making them target sources for future space-based detectors. However, because of the crowded nature of these galactic centers, these EMRIs could be perturbed by other nearby orbiting bodies. In this work, we analyze potential perturbations in EMRIs due to a third-body perturber near resonance. We use the formalism and code tools developed in the previous paper in this series [Silva \& Hirata, {\slshape Phys. Rev. D} {\bfseries 106}:084508 (2022)] and expand them to account for a general outer body orbit, allowing for multiple resonant interactions within an orbit and across a variety of SMBH spins. We find that, after investigating nearly 142,000 resonant interactions across a restricted set of 180 different simulated orbit systems, none cause changes to the EMRI dynamics beyond a perturbative correction, but could lead to potentially large changes in the phase of the waveform of order 0.1 radian. Detectable phase changes in the waveform induced by third-body perturbers could be a common occurrence and will require careful consideration for developing accurate EMRI waveform models. This analysis suggests that our formalism and pipeline are robust enough to handle a wide variety of resonances from various perturbing orbit configurations around the EMRI, which will aid in developing more accurate waveform models to better probe galactic center environments and test theories of gravity using gravitational wave observations of EMRIs.",
New submissions,"Inverse Mobius Spacetime in 1+1D Quantum Gravity: Functional Analytic Structures, Dirac Spectrum, and Pin Geometry",Anik Chakraborty,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Functional Analysis (math.FA),"In this manuscript, we formulate a (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity toy model whose Euclidean spacetime manifold is the MÃ¶bius band $M$. Since $M$ is non-orientable, the relevant spin-statistics structure is Pin rather than Spin. To emphasize the role of orientation reversal, we refer to the universal orientable cover $\widetilde{M}$ as the inverse MÃ¶bius band, which resolves the MÃ¶bius twist into an infinite ribbon equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}$ deck action. We compute the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$, $w_2$, classify all $\mathrm{Pin}^\pm$ structures, construct the associated pinor bundles, and analyze the Dirac operator under the twisted equivariance condition \[ \psi(x+1, w) = \gamma^w \psi(x, -w). \] Half-integer momentum quantization, spectral symmetry, vanishing mod-2 index, and $\eta_D(0) = 0$ follow. In JT gravity, the two inequivalent Pin lifts in each parity double the non-perturbative saddle-point sum, yet leave the leading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy unchanged. Full proofs and heat-kernel calculations are provided for completeness.",
New submissions,Geodesics and Shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole Spacetime,"Xinyu Wang,Yehui Hou,Xi Wan,Minyong Guo,Bin Chen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"In this work, we investigate geodesics and black hole shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. We show that the equations of motion for null geodesics are separable and admit analytical treatment, whereas timelike geodesics are generally non-separable. Approximate analytical expressions for the photon sphere and the innermost stable circular orbit are derived via perturbative expansions in the magnetic field strength. We further explore the black hole shadow using both numerical and analytical methods, examining the effects of the magnetic field, the observer's inclination angle and radial position. Deviations from the standard Kerr shadow are quantified, and a physical interpretation is provided by introducing asymptotic regimes defined relative to the magnetic field strength.",
New submissions,Duality Symmetry and Anomaly for Gravitational Waves in Curved Spacetime,"Adrian del Rio,Javier Olmedo,AntÃ³nio Torres Manso",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The vacuum Einstein equations admit a formulation closely analogous to the source-free Maxwell theory. In particular, the linearized equations exhibit an electric-magnetic duality symmetry. We develop a framework that makes this analogy manifest by explicitly identifying the electric and magnetic components of perturbative gravitational waves. Within this formulation, we show that duality rotations between these gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields constitute a Noether symmetry of the linearized theory, and we derive the associated conserved current. The corresponding conserved charge encodes the difference in intensity between the right- and left-handed circularly polarized components of the gravitational wave - that is, between its self-dual and anti-self-dual parts. Remarkably, this conservation law remains valid even when the gravitational perturbations propagate on generic curved backgrounds. We then investigate whether this symmetry survives quantization. While the duality symmetry is preserved at the quantum level in flat spacetime, we find that it is anomalously broken in curved backgrounds. As a result, an imbalance between right- and left-handed gravitons could be excited from the vacuum. This effect represents a chiral anomaly for massless spin-two fields, generalizing known results for fermions and spin-one photon fields.",
New submissions,Convergence of Higher-Curvature Expansions Near the Horizon: Hawking Radiation from Regular Black Holes,"Roman. A. Konoplya,Alexander Zhidenko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"A recently proposed model incorporating a series of higher-curvature corrections allows for analytic black-hole solutions at each order of the expansion, with a fully regular black hole emerging in the limit of infinite number of terms. An important question that arises within this framework is how rapidly the series converges. For those classical observables, which are primarily determined by the geometry near the peak of the effective potential, it has been previously shown that the series converges remarkably fast, often within the first two orders. However, this rapid convergence does not extend to quantities such as Hawking radiation, which are highly sensitive to the geometry near the event horizon. Although each successive order yields a result that is significantly closer to that of the full infinite series, several terms are typically required to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation of the regular black hole in this context.",
New submissions,A note on Gravitational radiation in generalized Brans-Dicke theory: compact binary systems,"Diego S. Jesus,Hermano Velten,JÃºnior D. Toniato",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This note revisits and corrects a previous analysis on gravitational radiation in compact binary systems within the framework of Brans-Dicke-f(R) theories-models featuring both massless and effectively massive scalar fields. We correct the lower bound on the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter $\omega_0$ presented in prior work, identifying teh issue that led to inverted constraints. By reanalyzing data from the binary system PSR J1012+5307, we present revised bounds on $\omega_0$ as a function of the geometrical scalar field mass $m_f$, emphasizing that the role of $\omega_0$ differs from its traditional interpretation in standard BD theory.",
New submissions,Photon Deflection and Magnification in Kalb-Ramond Black Holes with Topological String Configurations,"Faizuddin Ahmed,Ä°zzet SakallÄ±,Ahmad Al-Badawi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This theoretical investigation examines gravitational lensing phenomena in Schwarzschild-like black holes (BHs) within Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity frameworks incorporating cosmic string (CS) and cloud of strings (CoS) topological configurations. We develop comprehensive analytical methodologies for investigating photon deflection angles and magnification characteristics in both Schwarzschild-like BHs in KR gravity pierced by CSs (SKRCS) and Schwarzschild-like BHs in KR gravity with CoS (SKRCoS) spacetime geometries through dual approaches: perturbative expansions yielding approximate solutions and exact elliptic integral formulations providing complete mathematical descriptions across parameter spaces. For CS configurations characterized by Lorentz violation (LV) and CS parameters, deflection angles exhibit systematic modifications through composite geometric factors, while CoS geometries demonstrate distinct deflection characteristics incorporating additional topological parameters that fundamentally alter light propagation dynamics. Magnification analysis reveals distinctive critical curve positioning modifications and amplitude scaling relationships enabling observational discrimination between exotic BH scenarios and conventional spacetime geometries. Strong field analysis utilizing established mathematical frameworks establishes logarithmic divergence coefficients characterizing fundamental scaling behavior in photon sphere proximity regimes. Observational constraints from Solar System precision tests restrict LV parameters within stringent bounds, while galactic-scale observations permit expanded parameter ranges for CS and CoS configurations.",
New submissions,Scalar tidal response of static and rotating black holes in anti-de Sitter spacetime,"Yusmantoro,Freddy Permana Zen,Hadyan Luthfan Prihadi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we investigate the tidal response of both static and rotating black holes in anti de-Sitter spacetime. We perform the neutral scalar field perturbation for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. On the other hand, charged scalar field are used for perturbing Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman black holes. We find that the tidal Love number for all black holes are always nonvanishing due to the presence of cosmological constant. In contrast, tidal dissipation can vanish for certain conditions depending on the scalar field's frequency and the black hole's parameters.",
New submissions,Gravitons and Temperature Fluctuation Correlations from Inflation,"L. H. Ford,I-Tai Ho,Chun-Hsien Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Inflationary tensor perturbations are treated as arising from a bath of gravitons produced by quantum particle creation at the end of inflation. We calculate the correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations produced by these gravitons in a model with an infrared cut off. The CMB photons are emitted from within a last scattering shell of finite thickness in redshift. We find the correlation function in terms of the separation of a pair of spacetime points of emission in both angle and redshift. In both variables, there is a significant amount of anti-correlation. The anti-correlation minimum has a relative magnitude compared to the central correlation maximum of about 20% in angle and 50% in redshift.",
New submissions,Parameter Estimation for GW200208\_22 with Targeted Eccentric Numerical-relativity Simulations,"Patricia McMillin(RIT),Katelyn J. Wagner(RIT),Giuseppe Ficarra(UNICAL),Carlos O. Lousto(RIT),Richard O'Shaughnessy(RIT)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We have analyzed LVK gravitational wave events that show some evidence of eccentricity from TEOBResumS modeling parameter estimations and have confronted them independently with full numerical generated waveforms from our bank of nearly two thousand simulations of binary black holes. We have used RIFT for Bayesian parameter estimation and found that GW200208\_{22} KDE estimates favor eccentricities $e_{20} = 0.217_{-0.184}^{+0.076}$ upon entering the LVK band at $\sim20$Hz within a 90\% confidence limit. Within this event analysis we employed 39 new targeted full numerical relativity simulations and we have thus found a top improved likelihood $\ln \mathcal{L}$ matching waveform, compared to model-based analysis, with an estimated eccentricity at 20Hz, $e_{20}=0.200$, thus reinforcing the eccentric hypothesis of the binary. We have also used our full bank of numerical waveforms on GW190620 finding that it favors eccentricities in the range of {$0\leq e_{10}\leq0.3$}. New specifically targeted simulations will be required to narrow this eccentricity range.",
Cross submissions,Arbitrarily Negative Energy for Small Kaluza-Klein Bubbles,"Gary T. Horowitz,Guanyu(Ricky)Lu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that the ADM energy of a Kaluza-Klein bubble of nothing is unbounded from below even if the size of the circle at infinity and the size of the minimal sphere at the bubble are fixed. We demonstrate this by presenting a family of explicit time-symmetric initial data satisfying these boundary conditions with arbitrarily negative energy. In particular, this is true for very small bubbles, which indicates that the standard Kaluza-Klein vacuum is more unstable than previously thought.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Wave Burst from Bremsstrahlung in Milky Way Can Discover Sub-Solar Dark Matter in Near Future,"Samsuzzaman Afroz,Suvodip Mukherjee",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"What is Dark Matter, and what is its concentration in the Milky Way remains an open question in physics. We show that if a significant fraction of dark matter is composed of sub-solar mass primordial black holes (PBHs), gravitational bremsstrahlung resulting from hyperbolic encounters between unbound PBHs within the galactic halos can generate distinctive chromatic gravitational-wave (GW) emission concentrated around the galactic dark matter halo, and it provides a direct window to discover such compact objects. We find that for both generalized NFW and Einasto dark matter profiles of Milky Way, the signal-to-noise ratio can be more than five in one year of observation for the upcoming ground based GW observatories Cosmic Explorer if PBH dark matter fraction $f_{\rm PBH} = 1$ over the mass range $10^{-14} M_\odot \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-8} M_\odot$. Our results show that the Galactic Center could appear as a GW-bright source, enabling new insights into dark matter and its distribution.",
Cross submissions,Self-consistent graviton spectral function in Lorentzian quantum gravity,"Jan M. Pawlowski,Manuel Reichert,Jonas Wessely",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present the first fully self-consistent computation of the graviton spectral function in quantum gravity, using the spectral renormalisation group for gravity put forward inarXiv:2111.13232v2[hep-th] within a physical mass-shell renormalisation scheme. Here, self-consistency refers to the fact that the full non-perturbative spectral function is used in the diagrams, including the scattering continuum. We find a positive graviton spectral function with a massless one-graviton peak and a multi-graviton continuum with a close-to-quadratic spectral decay in the ultraviolet. Within the physical on-shell renormalisation scheme, the graviton satisfies the sum rule of an asymptotic state and features a unit total spectral weight. We briefly discuss the implications of the physical formulation for the computation of scattering processes and investigations of unitarity in asymptotically safe quantum gravity.",
Cross submissions,Primordial Power Spectrum and Bispectrum from Lattice Simulations of Axion-U(1) Inflation,"Drew Jamieson,Angelo Caravano,Eiichiro Komatsu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present primordial non-Gaussianity predictions from a new high-precision code for simulating axion-U(1) inflation on a discrete lattice. We measure the primordial scalar curvature power spectrum and bispectrum from our simulations, determining their dependence on both scale and axion-gauge coupling strength. Both the gauge-sourced power spectrum and the bispectrum exhibit a strong blue tilt due to our choice of an $\alpha$-attractor inflaton potential. We provide fitting functions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that accurately reproduce these statistics across a wide range of scales and coupling strengths. While our fitting function for the bispectrum has a separable form, results from high-resolution simulations demonstrate that the full shape is not separable. Thus, our simulations generate realizations of primordial curvature perturbations with nontrivial correlators that cannot be generated using standard techniques for primordial non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds on the axion-gauge coupling strength based on the bispectrum constraints from the cosmic microwave background, demonstrating a new method for constraining inflationary primordial non-Gaussianity by simulating the nonlinear dynamics.",
Cross submissions,Stochastic-tail of the curvature perturbation in hybrid inflation,"Tomoaki Murata,Yuichiro Tada",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation. On top of these tails, effective upper bounds on the curvature perturbation are also observed, corresponding to the exact hilltop trajectory during the waterfall phase. We find that in the model where the leading and higher-order terms in the expansion of the inflaton potential around the critical point are fine-tuned to balance, this upper bound can be significantly reduced, even smaller than the primordial black hole (PBH) threshold, as a novel perturbation-reduction mechanism than the one proposed in Ref. [1]. It makes PBH formation much difficult compared to the Gaussian or exponential-tail approximation. We also introduce Johnson's $S_U$-distribution as a useful fitting function for the PDF. It reveals a nonlinear mapping between the Gaussian field and the curvature perturbation, which enables us to apply the peak theory to estimate the PBH function.",
Cross submissions,Tensor induced gravitational waves,"Fei-Yu Chen,Jing-Zhi Zhou,Di Wu,Zhi-Chao Li,Peng-Yu Wu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Primordial gravitational waves on small scales are not tightly constrained by current cosmological observations, which allows for the possibility of large amplitudes at small scales. We investigate second-order tensor induced gravitational waves (TIGWs) sourced by primordial gravitational waves and present the corresponding corrections to the total energy density spectrum of gravitational wave. We analyze primordial gravitational waves with large amplitudes generated by various models at small scales. Our results indicate that when primordial gravitational waves on small scales sufficiently dominate the current PTA observations, corrections to the total energy density spectrum from second-order TIGWs may become pronounced in certain frequency bands.",
Cross submissions,The Chiral Limit of Fully Nonlinear Minimal Massive Gravity,"Massimo Porrati,Xilin Sheng",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study 3D Anti de Sitter Minimal Massive Gravity near the chiral limit where one of the boundary Brown-Henneaux central charges vanishes and two modes become null. We go beyond the known free-theory analysis to prove that these modes decouple completely also in the full MMG Lagrangian and field equations. We also use the full action to ascertain if the interacting theory becomes infinitely strongly coupled in the chiral limit. We show that this is not the case at tree level but that a strong coupling pathology appears in loops, starting at a loop level determined by the number of external legs in the bulk Feynman diagrams. We briefly discuss the relevance of this pathology for the holographic duality between MMG and chiral 2D conformal field theories and comment on its possible resolutions.",
