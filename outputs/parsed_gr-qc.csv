New submissions,Cosmological Reconstructions in Einstein--Cartan--Myrzakulov Gravity with Torsion and Non-Metricity in the Weitzenböck Geometrical Sector,"Davood Momeni,Ratbay Myrzakulov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The universe is a vast and complex system, and our understanding of its fundamental workings is constantly evolving. In this work, we present a novel modification to the standard theory of gravity by incorporating curvature, torsion, non-metricity, and the geometric structure of Weitzenböck spacetime. This modified framework, referred to as the Einstein--Cartan--Myrzakulov (ECM) model, enriched by Weitzenböck geometry, offers new insights into cosmological phenomena, including the accelerated expansion of the universe, the nature of dark energy and dark matter, and the formation of cosmic structures. Our model not only reproduces observed cosmic histories but also provides testable predictions that can be compared with current and future observational data. By addressing some of the most profound questions in modern cosmology, this work paves the way for a deeper understanding of the universe's evolution and the fundamental forces that govern it. The ECM model, extended through Weitzenböck spacetime, invites further exploration, offering the potential to revolutionize our conception of gravity and the cosmos.",
New submissions,Effective source for second-order self-force calculations: quasicircular orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime,"Samuel D. Upton,Barry Wardell,Adam Pound,Niels Warburton,Leor Barack",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent years have seen the first production of ""post-adiabatic"" gravitational-waveform models based on second-order gravitational self-force theory. These models rely on calculations of an effective source in the perturbative second-order Einstein equation. Here, for the first time, we detail the calculation of the effective source in a Schwarzschild background, which underlies the second-order self-force results in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 151102 (2021); ibid. 128, 231101 (2022); ibid. 130, 241402 (2023)]. The source is designed for use in the multiscale form of the Lorenz-gauge Einstein equation, decomposed in tensor spherical harmonics, or in the analogous second-order Teukolsky equation. It involves, among other things, contributions from (i) quadratic coupling of first-order field modes, (ii) the slow evolution of first-order fields, (iii) quadratic products of a first-order puncture field, and (iv) the second-order puncture field. We validate each of these pieces through numerical and analytical tests.",
New submissions,Eccentricity signatures in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's BNS and NSBH binaries,"Keisi Kacanja,Kanchan Soni,Alexander Harvey Nitz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Measurement of eccentricity in low-mass binary systems through gravitational waves is crucial to distinguish between various formation channels. Detecting eccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate eccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian inferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass gravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using the new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the existing model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity constraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in both models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and parallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible eccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20 Hz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for SEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides moderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of $\sim10-15$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on eccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources are consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \leq 0.011$ to $e \leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in GW190814.",
New submissions,Quantum-Corrected Thermodynamics of Conformal Weyl Gravity Black Holes: GUP Effects and Phase Transitions,"Erdem Sucu,İzzet Sakallı,Suat Dengiz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes in Conformal Weyl Gravity (CWG) using the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, with particular emphasis on quantum corrections that become significant near the Planck scale. Our analysis employs the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism to derive the Hawking temperature, revealing explicit contributions from the conformal parameters $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $k$ that lead to substantial deviations from Schwarzschild black hole behavior. We incorporate quantum gravitational effects through the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, demonstrating systematic suppression of thermal radiation in the near-Planckian regime. Using an exponentially corrected entropy model, we compute the complete spectrum of QC thermodynamic potentials, including internal energy, pressure, heat capacity, and free energies. Our heat capacity analysis reveals critical phase transitions separating thermodynamically stable and unstable regions, with the scale-dependent parameter $\gamma$ playing a crucial role in controlling phase structure. The Joule-Thomson expansion analysis shows distinct cooling and heating regimes with inversion points that shift systematically with CWG parameters, capturing QC phase transitions absent in general relativity. We also examine gravitational redshift in CWG geometry, finding complex radial dependence that could provide observable signatures for distinguishing conformal gravity from Einstein's theory. Our results demonstrate that CWG offers a consistent framework for studying black hole thermodynamics beyond general relativity, with quantum corrections revealing rich phase structures and potential observational consequences.",
New submissions,Can the latent signatures of quantum superposition be detected through correlation harvesting?,"Yu Tang,Wentao Liu,Zhilong Liu,Jieci Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In this paper, we explore correlation harvesting in quantum superposition, specifically focusing on the entanglement and mutual information extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in a mass-superposed BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that the superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance the entanglement harvesting relative to a single spacetime background. In contrast to entanglement, the mutual information obtained in spacetime superposition is influenced by the proper distance between the two detectors. While the mutual information harvested in a superposed spacetime remains lower than that in a single spacetime when the proper distance between detectors is small, it exceeds that in a single spacetime for specific mass ratios as the distance increases. Notably, we find that both entanglement and mutual information harvesting reach their maxima when the final spacetime superposition state is conditioned to align with the initial spacetime state.",
New submissions,Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion,"Bo Liang,Chang Liu,Hanlin Song,Zhenwei Lyu,Minghui Du,Peng Xu,Ziren Luo,Sensen He,Haohao Gu,Tianyu Zhao,Manjia Liang Yuxiang Xu,Li-e Qiang,Mingming Sun,Wei-Liang Qian",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Space Physics (physics.space-ph),"The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like LISA and Taiji promises deep insights into strong-field gravity and black hole astrophysics. However, the complex, non-convex likelihood landscapes of EMRI signals (compounded by instrumental noises) have long hindered reliable parameter estimation based on traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which often fail to escape local optima or require impractical computational costs. To address this critical bottleneck, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a pioneering Bayesian framework that synergizes continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By leveraging CNFs to rapidly explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and PTMCMC for precise posterior sampling, FM-MCMC achieves unprecedented efficiency and accuracy in recovering EMRI intrinsic parameters. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference, FM-MCMC unlocks the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.",
New submissions,Quantum entanglement of Hawking-Partner modes in expanding cavities,"José Manuel Montes-Armenteros,Javier Olmedo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"This article investigates quantum entanglement generated within a one-dimensional cavity where one boundary undergoes prescribed acceleration, a setup designed to mimic aspects of Hawking radiation. We quantify quantum correlations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$ is a given mode and subsystem $B$ the rest of the system. For initial pure states, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the Hotta-Schützhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Besides the initial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed states, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated. Moreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond the validity of our numerical algorithms. Our findings reveal that the expanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner pairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. A significant conclusion is that, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a low-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to the partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the boundaries, quantum entanglement decreases towards the ultraviolet modes, indicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and hence less probable to contribute in the purification process. While the Hotta-Schützhold-Unruh formula offers notable computational efficiency, partner modes do not commute, due to the non-trivial multimode entanglement structure of the system. Hence, this pairwise description is not suitable for describing the full system.",
New submissions,Search for dynamical black hole captures with Gaussian mixture modelling,"Leigh Smith,Shubhanshu Tiwari,Michael Ebersold,Yeong-Bok Bae,Gungwon Kang,Ik Siong Heng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves (GWs) are expected to originate from black holes interacting dynamically in dense astrophysical environments. In such environments, given that the velocity and cross section between the interacting black holes is low, dynamical capture may occur. Such events merge on very short timescales with high eccentricities and are expected to be detectable in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. In this work, we present a dedicated search for dynamical black hole capture events in the third LVK observing run with the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm enhanced with Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) post-production. With this we consider two applications of GMM: a weakly-modeled approach searching for generic short transients under minimal assumptions, and a population informed approach, in which the GMM model is provided information on the parameter space occupied by the capture population. Although our search does not find any new significant GW events, we find that an informed GMM approach brings significant sensitivity improvements, enabling the detection of dynamical capture events up to a distance of 1.9 Gpc for a 200 $M_{\odot}$ equal mass binary. We present updated upper limit estimates of the rate at 90\% confidence, the most stringent of which is 0.15 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, a 34\% improvement with respect to previous observational estimates. Furthermore, while the weakly-modeled GMM approach is less sensitive to dynamical capture systems, we find that it is possible for these events to be detected up to a distance of 1 Gpc in the cWB-GMM all-sky short search under minimal assumptions. Finally, with the confident detection of GW190521, we estimate the rate of similar events to be 0.94 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, assuming the event originated from a dynamical capture.",
New submissions,Thermal aspects of the anomalous $ω\to \infty$ limit of Brans-Dicke gravity,"L. Gallerani,A. Giusti,A. Mentrelli,V. Faraoni",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Brans-Dicke gravity does not always reduce to General Relativity in the limit $\omega\to\infty$ for the coupling constant. This anomalous behavior is examined within the formalism of the first-order thermodynamics of scalar-tensor gravity. It is shown that this effect is linked to the non-vanishing nature of the chemical potential, in the Einstein frame formulation of the thermodynamic analogy, in the $\omega\to\infty$ limit.",
New submissions,Probing scalar field with generic extreme mass-ratio inspirals around Kerr black holes,"Tieguang Zi,Shailesh Kumar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The future space-based gravitational wave observatories are expected to provide unprecedented opportunities to explore intricate characteristics of black hole binaries, particularly for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object slowly inspirals into a supermassive black hole. These systems are very prominent sources for testing gravity in the strong gravity fields and for probing potential deviations from general relativity, including those arising from the presence of fundamental scalar fields. In this work, we examine the impact of a scalar charge carried by the inspiraling object within the context of EMRIs. We focus on generic orbits that present both eccentricity and inclination to evaluate how these parameters affect the modifications induced by the scalar charge to the gravitational wave signal. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of orbital inclination, in particular, enhances the detectability of scalar field effects by introducing richer waveform features that deviate from the purely general relativistic case. The interplay among scalar charge, eccentricity and inclination provides a more complete sampling of the black hole spacetime, suggesting that EMRIs with such generic orbits represent compelling systems for stringently constraining or discovering new fundamental fields through future gravitational wave observations.",
New submissions,Rigidity aspects of a cosmological singularity theorem,"Eric Ling,Carl Rossdeutscher,Walter Simon,Roland Steinbauer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inspired by the classical singularity theorems in General Relativity, Galloway and Ling have shown the following (cf. Theorem 0): If a globally hyperbolic spacetime satisfying the null energy condition contains a closed, spacelike Cauchy surface $(V,g,K)$ (with metric $g$ and extrinsic curvature ${K}$) which is strictly 2-convex (meaning that the sum of the lowest two eigenvalues of $K$ is positive) then $V$ is either a spherical space or past null geodesically incomplete \cite{Ling, Ling2}. In the present work we relax the convexity condition in two respects. Firstly (cf. Theorem 1) we admit $2$-convex extrinsic curvatures, (for which the sum of the lowest two eigenvalues is non-negative) which allows for the following further possibility: Either $V$ or some finite cover $\tilde V$ are surface bundles over the circle, with totally geodesic fibers. Secondly, (cf. Theorem 2) if $(V,g,{K})$ admits a $U(1)$ isometry group with corresponding Killing vector $\xi$, we can further relax the convexity requirement in terms of the decomposition of ${K}$ with respect to the directions parallel and orthogonal to $\xi$. Compared to Theorem 1, this yields more specific information on the possible foliations of $V$, depending on whether the isometry is tangent to the base or to the fibers. Moreover, in the special cases that $V$ is either non-orientable, or non-prime, or an orientable Haken manifold with vanishing second homology, we obtain stronger statements in both Theorems without passing to covers. While our results do not use Einstein's equations, we provide several classes of $\Lambda$-vacuum solutions of these equations as examples.",
New submissions,Gravitational Lensing in the Schwarzschild Spacetime: Photon Rings in Vacuum and in the Presence of a Plasma,Torben C. Frost,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Astrophysical black holes are usually surrounded by an accretion disk. At least parts of these accretion disks consist of a plasma in which light rays with different energies are dispersed. However, we usually do not know the exact configurations of these plasmas. In this paper we will now use the example of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in an inhomogeneous pressureless and nonmagnetised plasma to investigate how the structural changes of the photon rings can help us to determine the properties of a plasma surrounding a black hole using multifrequency observations. For this purpose we will use a simple analytic model which describes a plasma whose electron density increases towards the equatorial plane when we approach the event horizon. For the chosen model we will first derive and then analytically solve the equations of motion. Then we will place an observer in the domain of outer communication and introduce an orthonormal tetrad to relate the constants of motion to latitude-longitude coordinates on the observer's celestial sphere. In the next step we will use the analytic solutions to investigate the geometric structures of the direct image as well as the photon rings of first and second order on the observer's celestial sphere. We will write down a lens equation and calculate the redshift and the travel time. We will compare the obtained results to results for photon rings in vacuum and in the presence of a homogeneous plasma. Finally, we will discuss which of these quantities can be used to extract information about the properties of the plasma.",
New submissions,Regular black holes without mass-inflation instability and gravastars from modified gravity,"Astrid Eichhorn,Pedro G. S. Fernandes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We derive regular black-hole solutions, including the Hayward metric, from four-dimensional action principles involving vector fields in addition to the metric. These black holes possess additional hair associated with the vector fields, manifesting as free integration constants that regularize the geometry. These constants can be chosen such that regular black holes of all masses are extremal. As a result, they have vanishing surface gravity and are not susceptible to mass-inflation instability. We also discover another regular black-hole metric with these properties, which constitutes a gravastar for an appropriate choice of integration constant.",
New submissions,Noncommutative Geometry Inspired AdS Black Hole with a Cloud of Strings Surrounded by Quintessence-like fluid,"Faizuddin Ahmed,Allan. R. P. Moreira,Abdelmalek Bouzenada",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the geometric and physical properties of an anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole space-time coupled by a cloud of strings and surrounded by a quintessence-like fluid, all within the framework of non-commutative (NC) geometry. From the perspective of geometrical optics, we analyze the behavior of null geodesics, focusing on key optical features such as the effective potential, the structure and radius of the photon sphere, light deflection angles, photon trajectories, and the resulting black hole (BH) shadow. Our findings show that the combined effects of the string cloud and quintessence-like fluid significantly modify photon dynamics and optical observables, leading to notable deviations from standard BH scenarios in NC geometry background. We also examine time-like geodesics, with particular emphasis on the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). The results demonstrate that the presence of geometric matter components alters the ISCO radius compared to conventional solutions. In addition, we explore the thermodynamic behavior of the BH, deriving expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. The influence of the string cloud and quintessence-like fluid introduces substantial modifications to the thermodynamic profile, including shifts in phase transition points and changes to stability conditions under NC geometric effects. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of massless scalar field perturbations in this modified background by formulating the Klein-Gordon equation and reducing it to a Schrödinger-like form via separation of variables. The resulting effective potential is analyzed in detail, highlighting the significant role of both the string cloud and the quintessence-like fluid in shaping the perturbative landscape within the NC geometry setting.",
Cross submissions,Hybrid Black Hole-Disk Driven Jets: Steady Axisymmetric Ideal MHD Modeling,"Yu Song,Yehui Hou,Lei Huang,Bin Chen",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Improved observational precision in relativistic jets has underscored the need for tractable theoretical models. In this study, we construct a semi-analytical hybrid jet model that incorporates both black hole-driven and disk-driven components within the framework of steady, axisymmetric, ideal MHD. We derive a condition that determines the launching sites of cold outflows, introducing a new constraint on the magnetic field configuration threading the accretion disk. Using the Bernoulli equation and critical point analysis, we derive flow solutions along various magnetic field lines. Our hybrid jet model shows that discontinuities in field-line angular velocity lead to clear velocity shear and density jumps at the interface between the two jet components. These features are accompanied by localized enhancements in velocity and density, potentially explaining the observed limb-brightening.",
Cross submissions,The Prediction and Interpretation of Singularities and Black Holes: From Einstein and Schwarzschild to Penrose and Wheeler,Dennis Lehmkuhl,History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Schwarzschild solution was the first exact solution to Einstein's 1915 field equations, found by Karl Schwarzschild as early as 1916. And yet, physicists, mathematicians and philosophers have struggled for decades with the interpretation of the Schwarzschild solution and the two singularities appearing in it when it is written in polar coordinates. This article distinguishes between eight different ways in which the two singularities have been interpreted between 1916 and the late 1960s, when Penrose's first singularity theorem shed new and lasting light on the interpretation of the Schwarzschild solution.",
Cross submissions,Volume as an index of a subalgebra,"Samuel Leutheusser,Hong Liu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We propose a new way to understand the volume of certain subregions in the bulk of AdS spacetime by relating it to an algebraic quantity known as the index of inclusion. This index heuristically measures the relative size of a subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$ embedded within a larger algebra $\mathcal{M}$. According to subregion-subalgebra duality, bulk subregions are described by von Neumann algebras on the boundary. When a causally complete bulk subregion corresponds to the relative commutant $\mathcal{N}' \cap \mathcal{M}$ -- the set of operators in $\mathcal{M}$ that commute with $\mathcal{N}$ -- of boundary subalgebras, we propose that the exponential of the volume of the maximal volume slice of the subregion equals the index of inclusion. This ``volume-index'' relation provides a new boundary explanation for the growth of interior volume in black holes, reframing it as a change in the relative size of operator algebras. It offers a complementary perspective on complexity growth from the Heisenberg picture, and has a variety of other applications, including quantifying the relative size of algebras dual to the entanglement wedge and the causal wedge of a boundary region, as well as quantifying the violation of additivity of operator algebras in the large $N$ limit. Finally, it may offer insights into the volume growth of de Sitter space through the changes in North and South pole observer algebras in time.",
Cross submissions,2D End-to-End Modeling of Kilonovae from Binary Neutron-Star Merger Remnants,"Lieke Sippens Groenewegen,Sanjana Curtis,Philipp Mösta,Daniel Kasen,Daniel Brethauer",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the kilonova emission resulting from outflows produced in a three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant. We map the outflows into the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and study the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for the highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with respect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation without heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\sim$ 2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code and compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves in various LSST bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime, with peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants that produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence of both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While the short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from angles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more luminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight the importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and taking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed kilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS -- if it survives long enough -- could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission seen in AT2017gfo.",
Cross submissions,Generalizing the Penrose cut-and-paste method: Null shells with pressure and energy flux,"Miguel Manzano,Argam Ohanyan,Roland Steinbauer",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"The cut-and-paste method is a procedure for constructing null thin shells by matching two regions of the same spacetime across a null hypersurface. Originally proposed by Penrose, it has so far allowed to describe purely gravitational and null-dust shells in constant-curvature backgrounds. In this paper, we extend the cut-and-paste method to null shells with arbitrary gravitational/matter content. To that aim, we first derive a locally Lipschitz continuous form of the metric of the spacetime resulting from the most general matching of two constant-curvature spacetimes with totally geodesic null boundaries, and then obtain the coordinate transformation that turns this metric into the cut-and-paste form with a Dirac-delta term. The paper includes an example of a null shell with non-trivial energy density, energy flux and pressure in Minkowski space.",
Cross submissions,Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions,"Zi-Yu Hou,Yu-Qi Lei,Xian-Hui Ge",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of curvature parameters and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.",
Cross submissions,Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer,"Daniel Voigt,Oliver Gerberding",Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.",
Cross submissions,Effective Phantom Divide Crossing with Standard and Negative Quintessence,"Adrià Gómez-Valent,Alex González-Fuentes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmic microwave background data from the Planck satellite, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this Letter, we show that this peak does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to 0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in front of standard quintessence around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at a $3.27\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant role in cosmic dynamics.",
Cross submissions,Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation from GRB 221009A Using the DisCan Method,"Yu Xi,Fu-Wen Shu",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Lorentz symmetry is a cornerstone of modern physics, and testing its validity remains a critical endeavor. In this work, we analyze the photon time-of-flight and time-shift data from LHAASO observations of Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 221009A to search for signatures of Lorentz violation. We employed the DisCan (dispersion cancellation) method with various information entropies as cost functions, designating the results obtained with Shannon entropy as our representative outcome. This choice is attributed to the parameter-free statistical properties of Shannon entropy, which has demonstrated remarkable stability as we continually refine and enhance our methodology. In the absence of more detailed data and physical context, it provides more stable and reliable results. We constrain the energy scale associated with Lorentz invariance violation. Our results yield 95\% confidence level lower limits of $E_{\text{QG},1} > 5.4 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\text{QG},1} > 2.7 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the linear case ($n$=1), and $E_{\text{QG},2} > 10.0 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\text{QG},2} > 2.4 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the quadratic case ($n$=2). Subsequently, we incorporated WCDA photons and the Knuth binning method to further optimize and complement our approach, while also performing filter using information entropies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that employing different information entropy measures as cost functions does not alter the order of magnitude of these constraints.",
Cross submissions,Higher spin fields and the field strength multicopy,"Graham R. Brown,Bill Spence",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We discuss the generalisation of the Weyl double copy to higher spin ""multi-copies"", showing how the natural linearised higher spin field strengths can be related to sums of powers of the Maxwell tensor. The tracelessness of the field strength involves the appropriate Fronsdal equations of motion for the higher spin field. We work with spacetimes admitting Kerr-Schild coordinates and give a number of examples in different dimensions. We note that the multi-copy is particularly transparent in four dimensions if one uses spinor descriptions of the fields, relating this to the Penrose transform. The higher-dimensional spinor multicopy is also explored and reveals some interesting new features arising from the little group based identification of higher spin field strengths and Maxwell tensor types. We then turn to the vector superspace formalism describing higher spin and `continuous' spin representations given by Schuster and Toro, based on symmetric tensor fields. Here the Kerr-Schild higher spin fields we have used earlier naturally package into a simple expression involving an arbitrary function, when the continuous spin scale $\rho$ is set to zero. Further, we discuss the case of an anti-de Sitter background, where there is also a vector space formalism given by Segal and we clarify this approach using a different definition of the covariant derivative. We give a general solution of Kerr-Schild type and finally we describe some of the obstacles to a continuous spin formulation.",
Cross submissions,Can cosmic rotation resolve the Hubble tension? Constraints from CMB and large-scale structure,"Micol Benetti,David A. Cook,Saulo Carneiro",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a relativistic cosmological model with background rotation, sourced by a non-perfect fluid with anisotropic stress. A modified version of the CLASS Boltzmann code is employed to perform MCMC analyses against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and late-time datasets. The results show that current CMB data constrain the present-day rotation parameter to be negligible. As a consequence, the derived cosmological parameters remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM values. In contrast, late-time probes such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) allow for a higher level of rotation and yield an increased Hubble constant. However, this comes at the cost of a higher $\sigma_8$, which remains in tension with DES-Y3 measurement. Combining CMB, SNe and BAO data confirms the preference for non-rotation.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism I: Pure axion inflation,"Richard von Eckardstein,Kai Schmitz,Oleksandr Sobol",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Axion inflation is a well-motivated model of cosmic inflation with a rich phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies of axion inflation that may confirm or improve the predictions of our GEF benchmark.",
Cross submissions,Proper-time functional renormalization in $O(N)$ scalar models coupled to gravity,"Alfio Bonanno,Emiliano Glaviano,Gian Paolo Vacca",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We focus on the use of the functional Wilsonian renormalization group framework characterized by a proper time regulator and test its use in the search of the scaling solutions and the critical properties of an O(N)-invariant scalar field multiplet coupled to gravity in d=4 and d=3 dimensions. We employ the same background-fluctuation splitting and gauge fixing procedure, already adopted in a previous study based, instead, on the effective average action framework and a similar truncation of the effective action. Our main goal is to compare the results for the scaling solutions and some of the associated critical exponents. In this analysis, performed in a different framework, most of the picture previously uncovered is confirmed both at qualitative and quantitative level. There are, neverthelss, few differences both at finite N and in its large value limit, depending also on the schemes which in both frameworks are called 'improved'",
