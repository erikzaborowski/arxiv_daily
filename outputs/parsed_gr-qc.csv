New submissions,Thermodynamics and P-v criticality of RN-AdS black hole surrounded by PFDM on the EGUP framework,"Bo-Li Liu,Yu Zhang,Qi-Quan Li",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we systematically study the thermodynamic properties and P-v criticality of the RN-AdS black hole surrounded by PFDM in the framework of the extended generalized uncertainty principle (EGUP). In the extended phase space, starting from the first law of black hole thermodynamics, the EGUP-corrected Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and entropy are derived. Then, we use graphical methods to analyze the effects of the EGUP parameters on these thermodynamic quantities. Analysis of the heat capacity indicates that the EGUP correction is beneficial for maintaining the thermodynamic stability of black holes. Finally, based on the modified thermodynamic quantities, we obtain the EGUP-corrected black hole equation of state and Gibbs free energy. The G-T diagram with the EGUP correction effect is analyzed, and the results show that when $P<P_c$, a ``swallowtail'' behavior emerges, indicating that the black hole undergoes a first order phase transition. The position of the phase equilibrium point changes slightly as the EGUP parameters increase. For the cases of $P=P_c$ and $P>P_c$, we combine the analysis of the relationship between heat capacity and event horizon radius, finding that the phase transition characteristics depicted in the G-T diagram are similar to those without the correction effect.",
New submissions,An invariant measure of deviation from Petrov type D at the level of initial data,"Edgar Gasperin,Jarrod L. Williams",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this article, we describe a simple covariant characterisation of initial data sets which give rise to Petrov type D vacuum spacetime developments. As an application, we derive an integral invariant which, when restricted to the appropriate class of asymptotically Euclidean initial data sets, vanishes if and only if the initial dataset is isometric to initial data for the Kerr spacetime. As such, the invariant can be considered a measure of non-Kerrness on such initial data sets. In contrast with other similar invariants constructed through the notion of 'approximate Killing spinors', the present invariant is algebraic in the sense that it is algorithmically computable directly from initial data without having to solve any PDEs on the initial data hypersurface.",
New submissions,"Scalar Field Reconstructions of Holographic Dark Energy Models with Applications to Chaplygin Gas, DBI, Yang-Mills, and NLED Frameworks",Antonio Pasqua,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we investigate the cosmological implications of two DE models, introduced by Chen \& Jing \cite{modelhigher} and by Granda \& Oliveros \cite{gohnde}. The first model comprises three principal components: one term proportional to the Hubble parameter $ H$ squared, and two additional terms proportional to the first and second time derivatives of $ H $, respectively. The second model, known as New Holographic Dark Energy (NHDE) model, can be considered a generalization of the Ricci DE model and it contains a term proportional to the Hubble parameter $H$ squared and one to the first time derivative of $H$. We derive the analytical expressions for the reduced Hubble parameter squared $h^2$, the Equation of State (EoS) parameter of Dark Energy (DE) $\omega_D $, the pressure of DE $p_D$ and of the deceleration parameter $q $ considering both non-interacting and later on interacting DM and DE. We also consider some limiting cases for the integration constants obtained. Furthermore, we explore the limiting scenario of a flat, dark energy-dominated Universe and establish a correspondence between the proposed DE models and various scalar field frameworks. Specifically, we examine their connection with the Generalized Chaplygin Gas, the Modified Chaplygin Gas, the Modified Variable Chaplygin Gas, the Viscous Generalized Chaplygin Gas, as well as scalar field models based on Dirac-Born-Infeld theory, Yang-Mills theory and Nonlinear Electrodynamics.",
New submissions,New Lorentzian Taub-NUT and Euclidean Eguchi-Hanson Solutions in $f(R)$ gravity,"J. G. Fenwick,A. M. Ghezelbash",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"A New Taub-NUT black hole in multiple coordinate systems is solved and analyzed. This black-hole is found to be an extension of the Clifton-Barrow metric for the specific case that $\delta=-1/2$. We look at physical properties such as test particle orbits, thermodynamics, and various space-time limits. In addition, we show an Eguchi-Hanson type-II $f(R)$ solution related to the found Taub-NUT framework.",
New submissions,GW250114: testing Hawking's area law and the Kerr nature of black holes,"TheLIGO Scientific Collaboration, theVirgo Collaboration, theKAGRA Collaboration",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The gravitational-wave signal GW250114 was observed by the two LIGO detectors with a network matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 80. The signal was emitted by the coalescence of two black holes with near-equal masses $m_1 = 33.6^{+1.2}_{-0.8}\,M_\odot$ and $m_2 = 32.2^{+0.8}_{-1.3}\,M_\odot$, and small spins $\chi_{1,2} \leq 0.26$ (90% credibility) and negligible eccentricity $e \leq 0.03$. Post-merger data excluding the peak region are consistent with the dominant quadrupolar $(\ell = |m| = 2)$ mode of a Kerr black hole and its first overtone. We constrain the modes' frequencies to $\pm 30\%$ of the Kerr spectrum, providing a test of the remnant's Kerr nature. We also examine Hawking's area law, also known as the second law of black hole mechanics, which states that the total area of the black hole event horizons cannot decrease with time. A range of analyses that exclude up to 5 of the strongest merger cycles confirm that the remnant area is larger than the sum of the initial areas to high credibility.",
New submissions,Black Hole Spectroscopy and Tests of General Relativity with GW250114,"TheLIGO Scientific Collaboration, theVirgo Collaboration, theKAGRA Collaboration",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The binary black hole signal GW250114, the loudest gravitational wave detected to date, offers a unique opportunity to test Einstein's general relativity (GR) in the high-velocity, strong-gravity regime and probe whether the remnant conforms to the Kerr metric. Upon perturbation, black holes emit a spectrum of damped sinusoids with specific, complex frequencies. Our analysis of the post-merger signal shows that at least two quasi-normal modes are required to explain the data, with the most damped remaining statistically significant for about one cycle. We probe the remnant's Kerr nature by constraining the spectroscopic pattern of the dominant quadrupolar ($\ell = m = 2$) mode and its first overtone to match the Kerr prediction to tens of percent at multiple post-peak times. The measured mode amplitudes and phases agree with a numerical-relativity simulation having parameters close to GW250114. By fitting a parameterized waveform that incorporates the full inspiral-merger-ringdown sequence, we constrain the fundamental $(\ell=m=4)$ mode to tens of percent and bound the quadrupolar frequency to within a few percent of the GR prediction. We perform a suite of tests -- spanning inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- finding constraints that are comparable to, and in some cases 2-3 times more stringent than those obtained by combining dozens of events in the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. These results constitute the most stringent single-event verification of GR and the Kerr nature of black holes to date, and outline the power of black-hole spectroscopy for future gravitational-wave observations.",
New submissions,New test of modified gravity with gravitational wave experiments,"N. M. Jiménez Cruz,Flavio C. Sánchez,Gianmassimo Tasinato",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose a new strategy to probe non-tensorial polarizations in the stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. Averaging over polarization angles, we find that three-point correlations of the GW signal vanish for tensor and vector modes, while scalar modes generically leave a nonzero imprint. This property makes the GW bispectrum a distinctive and robust diagnostic of scalar polarizations predicted in theories beyond General Relativity. We derive the corresponding response functions for ground-based interferometers, pulsar timing arrays, and astrometric observables, and we construct an optimal estimator together with simple Fisher forecasts for pulsar-timing sensitivity. As a proof of principle, we show that second-order GWs sourced by primordial magnetogenesis can be characterized by large three-point functions. Our results demonstrate that GW three-point correlations provide a novel observational window on physics beyond General Relativity.",
New submissions,Rényi Law Constraints on Gauß-Bonnet Black Hole Merger,"Neeraj Kumar,Ankur Srivastav,Phongpichit Channuie",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this article, we explore the Rényi law constraints on black hole merger in Gauß-Bonnet (GB) gravity. Specifically, we consider the case of static solutions in five-dimensional (5D) Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetime and study the constraints on merger of two equal mass black holes. We calculate the general Rényi entropy expression and utilize it to study the bounds on the final black hole mass post-merger. We study its variation with the Rényi parameter. We also compare the results with those for black holes in General Relativity (GR). We find that the GB term has a significant impact on the bounds for black hole merger. The bounds for GB gravity become weaker for the zeroth order Rényi entropy and stronger for higher order Rényi entropies in comparison to GR.",
New submissions,On the red--shift emission from the black hole horizons replicas,"D. Pugliese,Z. Stuchlik",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We examine the red-shift emission from special orbits (horizons replicas) where photons have the same angular velocity, in magnitude, as those of the Kerr black hole (BH) Killing horizons. We focus on two particular contexts of special significance for their observational implications. A set of these orbits is located in the BH photons shell. Therefore the analysis also connects the red-shifting or blue-shifting from replicas (defined through the BH light surfaces) to the BH shadow boundaries. We then concentrate on the equatorial, general relativistic, axially symmetric accretion disks, orbiting around the central attractor. In the analysis we adopted in particular the Polish doughnut models of geometrically thick toroids, to investigate the signals frequency-shifting from the horizons replica as related to the disks surface, inner edge and accretion flows. The findings map the red-shifting and blue-shifting regions of the signals in dependence to the photons impact parameter, view-angle, angular velocity of the emitter and BH spin. Co-rotating and counter-rotating replica could be identified through the red-shifting or blue-shifting of the emitted signals from the mapped regions.",
New submissions,Photon spheres near black holes in a model with anisotropic fluid,"V. D. Ivashchuk,S. V. Bolokhov,F. B. Belissarova,N. Kydyrbay,A. N. Malybayev,G. S. Nurbakova,B. Zheng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The semi-review paper studies the null geodesics which appear for black hole solutions in the gravitational $4d$ model with anisotropic fluid. The equations of state for the fluid and solutions itselves depend upon integer parameter $q = 1, 2, ...$: $p_r = -\rho c^2 (2q-1)^{-1}, \quad p_t = - p_r$, where $\rho$ is the mass density, $c$ is speed of light, $p_r$ and $p_t$ are pressures in radial and transverse to radial directions, respectively. The circular null geodesics are explored and the master equation for radius $r_*$ of photon sphere is outlined as well as the proposition on existence and uniqueness of the solution to master equation obeying $r_* > r_h$, where $r_h$ is horizon radius. The relations for spectrum of quasinormal modes for a test massless scalar field in the eikonal approximation are overviewed and compared with cyclic frequencies of circular null geodesics. The shadow angles are explored.",
New submissions,"The Schrödinger equation for a spherically symmetric system, its structure and solutions","R. I. Ayala Oña,T. P. Shestakova",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Wheeler - DeWitt geometrodynamics, as the first attempt to develop a quantum theory of gravity, faces certain challenges, including the problem of time and the interpretation of the wave function. In this paper, we present the extended phase space approach to quantization of gravity as an alternative approach to the Wheeler - DeWitt quantum geometrodynamics. For a spacetime with a nontrivial topology, the Wheeler - DeWitt equation loses its sense, but we can derive the Schrödinger equation. Until now the Schrödinger equation was derived for systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, and we need to generalize the procedure for field models. The simplest field model is a spherically symmetric one. We derive the integro-differential Schrödinger equation for this model, examine its structure, and find its solution.",
New submissions,Scalarization of Bardeen spacetime,"Long-Xing Huang,Yong-Qiang Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we study the scalarization of the entire Bardeen spacetime which is constructed from a nonlinear magnetic monopole. We find that once the scalarization coupling parameter exceeds the scalarized threshold $a_t$, a scalarized Bardeen spacetime (SBS) solution exists for any magnetic charge $q$. However, the nature of the scalarization depends on the magnetic charge $q$. For $q$ less than a critical vaule $q_c$, when $a$ exceeds $a_t$, the scalar field emerges. As $a$ approaches $a_t$ from above (i.e., $a\to a_t^+$), the scalar field vanishes and the metric is reduced to a pure Bardeen spacetime. This behavior indicates that the solution exhibits the general ``spontaneous"" scalarization phenomenon. Conversely, for $q \geq q_c$, in the limit $a \to a_t^+$, the scalar field is non-vanishing and the SBS approaches a ``frozen"" SBS. Considering the importance of photon orbits in astronomical observations, we analyze the trajectories of photons around SBSs by analyzing null geodesics.",
New submissions,Gravity from equilibrium thermodynamics of stretched light cones,"Ana Alonso-Serrano,Luis J. Garay,Marek Liška,Celia López Pineros",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This work digs into the connection between gravity and thermodynamics of stretched light cones (SLC). They are associated with uniformly accelerating observers, who endow the SLC with a physical notion of temperature via the Unruh effect. We compute the expansion, shear, and vorticity of the SLC to fully study its dynamics and account for the possibility of previously predicted non-equilibrium entropy production. For consistency, we prove the equivalence of the two different geometrical methods available for studying the SLCs' properties. Then, we apply the energy balance and use Clausius' relation to relate the geometrical properties of the SLC with energy fluxes crossing its surface, showing that it encodes the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We show here how this analysis can be fully carried in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics due to the vanishing of shear, and how one can identify a work term related to the acceleration of the observer.",
New submissions,Gravitational radiation reaction around a static black hole surrounded by a Dehnen type dark matter halo,"Amjad Ashoorioon,Roberto Casadio,Khadije Jafarzade,Mohammad B. Jahani Poshteh,Orlando Luongo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.",
New submissions,Timelike convergence condition in regular black-hole spacetimes with (anti-)de Sitter core,"Johanna Borissova,Stefano Liberati,Matt Visser",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Hawking-Penrose (1970) singularity theorem weakens the causality assumption of global hyperbolicity used in the Penrose (1965) singularity theorem, at the expense of invoking the stronger timelike (instead of null) convergence condition (TCC). We analyze the TCC for a large class of dynamical spherically symmetric spacetimes, and show that it decomposes into three independent conditions on the Misner-Sharp mass function. For stationary black holes only two of these are non-trivial. One of these conditions is already implied by the null convergence condition (NCC), whereas the other one depends explicitly on the TCC and constrains the sign of the second derivative of the mass function. We show that generic asymptotically flat regular black holes with a smooth de Sitter core locally violate this new TCC-induced condition near the core, even if they globally satisfy the other condition imposed by the NCC. Therefore, it is the violation of the TCC which ensures that regular de Sitter core black holes circumvent the Hawking-Penrose theorem. By contrast, we show that asymptotically flat regular black holes with an anti-de Sitter core locally satisfy the new TCC-induced condition near the core, but necessarily violate it at some finite distance away from it. As concrete examples for both types of spacetimes, we consider TCC violations in the Bardeen black-hole spacetime with a de Sitter core, and in a modified Bardeen black-hole spacetime with an anti-de Sitter core.",
New submissions,Decisive Evidence for the First Overtone Mode in the Ringdown Signal of GW231028,Hai-Tian Wang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The properties of a remnant black hole can be probed by analyzing the gravitational waves emitted during its ringdown phase. This signal provides a direct test of general relativity in the strong-field regime. In this study, we apply a time-domain F-statistic framework to the ringdown of GW231028_153006 and find decisive evidence for the presence of the first overtone mode in the signal. The detection of the $\ell|m|n=221$ mode is statistically significant, achieving a Bayes factor of $193$ for an analysis beginning at $10\,M$ after the signal's peak amplitude--a time consistent with the linear perturbation regime. The inclusion of both the fundamental and overtone modes in our model allows for precise constraints on the remnant's properties. We infer a redshifted final mass of $243.0^{+22.7}_{-22.7}\,M_{\odot}$ and a final spin of $0.80_{-0.11}^{+0.07}$ (at $90\%$ credibility), derived from a ringdown signal with a network signal-to-noise ratio of approximately $10.5$. A test of the no-hair theorem, enabled by this two-mode detection, shows consistency with the predictions of general relativity.",
New submissions,Eikonal quasinormal modes of highly-spinning black holes in higher-curvature gravity: a window into extremality,"Pablo A. Cano,Marina David,Guido van der Velde",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We carry out the first computation of gravitational quasinormal modes of black holes with arbitrary rotation in a theory with higher-derivative corrections. Our analysis focuses on a recently identified quartic-curvature theory that preserves the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and that is connected to string theory. We find a master equation that governs large-momentum gravitational perturbations in this theory. By solving this equation with WKB methods, we provide complete results for the corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies for arbitrary spin and arbitrary $\mu=m/(\ell+1/2)$, where $\ell$ and $m$ are the harmonic numbers. Our results show that the corrections become orders of magnitude larger when the spin is close to extremality, with the modes close to the critical value of $\mu$ that separates damped and zero-damped modes being particularly sensitive. We also perform a geometric-optics analysis of gravitational-wave propagation around black holes and relate the equatorial ``graviton-sphere'' orbits to quasinormal mode frequencies with $\ell=m$. We find that the usual correspondence between the Lyapunov exponent of those orbits and the imaginary part of the frequency is modified.",
New submissions,An Einstein ring fingerprint around SMBHs illuminated by BLR spectral lines,"Konstantinos Kostaros,George Pappas,Padelis Papadopoulos,Wing-Fai Thi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The continuum emission from the hot and ionized inner regions of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk that is strongly lensed by the light-ring (i.e., the unstable photon orbit), is always superimposed on that of the locally emitting plasma near the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), masking strong-gravity effects and making their study difficult. A cleaner image of the light-ring against a non-luminous background, not affected by the emission and all the dynamical effects taking place near the ISCO, would thus be preferable. A more distant SMBH illumination source that could accommodate this can be provided by the unique spectral lines emitted by the cooler parts of the accretion disk, the so-called Broad Line Region (BLR). Spectral line emission from the transitional region between the inner disk and the outer BLR may be ideal for obtaining a cleaner image of the light-ring, and better suited for strong gravity tests. A crucial first order effect of a BLR spectral line illumination of the SMBHs in galactic centers, and a possible smoking gun signal of strong SMBH lensing, will be an Einstein ring, whose presence could be evident even in unresolved sources where only the total line profile can be acquired. In resolved sources, the combination of information from the image and the spectrum can even facilitate the measurement of the mass of the SMBH.",
New submissions,SMBH shadows: gravity fingerprints revealed by spectral line background radiation,"Konstantinos Kostaros,Padelis Papadopoulos,Wing-Fai Thi,George Pappas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"SMBHs at the centers of galaxies, illuminated by their accretion disks, can reveal valuable information on BH spacetimes via their shadows, which can be used for strong-gravity tests. However, the continuum emission from their highly turbulent hot plasma is expected to be strongly time-varying and with very inhomogeneous brightness. This can mask important SMBH-related effects, like the appearance of the light-ring, rendering them ineffective as probes of strong gravitational lensing physics. Besides being an inhomogeneous and strongly time-varying ''illuminator'', the hot plasma emission extends all the way to the ISCO. This then leads to the superposition of the strongly-lensed radiation from the area of the light-ring to the continuum emission from the ISCO, effectively making gravitational lensing physics hard to separate from accretion disk Astrophysics. These problems could be overcome if one utilizes the spectral line radiation field emanating from the cooler parts of the extended accretion disk, the so-called BLR, and especially its expected neutral phase, as a more distant, but still adequately strong SMBH illuminator, typically found at $r\sim (10^2-10^4)\, R_s$. This kind of illumination can provide a cleaner image of the light-ring region, and thus allow more information on the spacetime geometry around the SMBH to be obtained. Here, we examine some of the benefits of such an illumination in discerning strong-gravity physics near SMBHs and their observability. We expand on the fact that such emission can provide a smoking gun signal of lensing, in the form of an Einstein ring. To first order, the imaging of the Einstein ring and its spectroscopic signature can facilitate the measurement of the SMBH mass, while the second order effects associated with the light-ring can constrain the SMBH spin, and even identify deviations from the Kerr spacetime.",
Cross submissions,"Cosmology, Decoherence and the Second Law","Sebastian Cespedes,Senarath de Alwis,Fernando Quevedo",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider quantum decoherence and entropy increase in early universe cosmology. We first study decoherence in a discrete bipartite quantum system for which a single qubit gets entangled with an environment and the entropy increase is correlated with the decay of the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix. We compare this system with continuous systems relevant for cosmology for which there is a natural external intervention, corresponding to the time-dependent separation between the sub- and super-horizon inflationary fluctuations. We find, in this case, that the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix, in a field basis, do not decay as sometimes assumed in cosmological set-ups. Nevertheless, following a recent treatment in terms of open Effective Field Theories (EFTs), we compute the entanglement entropy for a Gaussian state and show that it actually increases monotonically ($\dot S>0$) during the accelerated phases ($\ddot a>0$ with $a(t)$ the scale factor). We generalise this result to include non-Gaussian states and briefly discuss the relevance of computing the von Neumann entropy as compared to the thermodynamic entropy.",
Cross submissions,The Effects of Near-AdS$_2$ Backreaction on Matter Fields,"Alejandra Castro,Jildou Hollander,Pedro J. Martinez,Evita Verheijden",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We quantify how the two-point function of a real scalar field is affected by the distortion caused by deforming AdS$_2$ to a near-AdS$_2$ background. At tree-level, the backreaction of the geometry induces a finite-temperature correction to the correlator that arises from interactions that the background generates. For a massive field, we show that this correction is not captured by JT gravity coupled to matter: it requires a backreaction of the metric field. For a massless field, the correction is controlled solely by the dilaton and hence is model-independent. We compare our findings with correlation functions on BTZ and find perfect agreement. We use our results to quantify the corrections for a class of correlators relevant to five- and four-dimensional black holes. We discuss how these corrections would enter in a holographic description of near-AdS$_2$; we also comment on how these corrections provide a universal prediction for quasinormal modes in higher dimensions.",
Cross submissions,Similarities in the evaporation of saturated solitons and black holes,"Giacomo Contri,Gia Dvali,Otari Sakhelashvili",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"It has been suggested some time ago that many black hole properties are not specific to gravity, but rather are shared by a large class of objects, the so-called saturons, that saturate the quantum field theoretic upper bound on microstate degeneracy. By now, various aspects of this universality have been understood and demonstrated in a number of explicit examples. In the present paper, we add one more brick to the building by showing that the decay of a simple two-dimensional saturated soliton copies some key aspects of the black hole decay as well as of the information retrieval. In particular, we study the evaporation process of a classically-stable vacuum bubble of a spontaneously broken $SU(N)$-symmetry, coupled to massless fermions. We show that the decay rate as well as the characteristic energy of the emitted quanta are given by the inverse size of the object, in striking similarity with the Hawking evaporation of a black hole. The time-scale of information retrieval also matches the one previously suggested for a black hole by Page. We give the semiclassical derivation of the phenomenon as well as its fully quantum resolution as a decaying coherent state of Goldstone bosons. The universal nature of the effect and its microscopic understanding support the analogous quantum portrait of a black hole as a saturated coherent state of gravitons.",
Cross submissions,Disordered Charged Horizons,"Daniel Arean,Sebastian Grieninger,Pau G. Romeu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We construct fully backreacted charged black brane solutions with a spatially disordered chemical potential in asymptotically AdS$_3$ and AdS$_4$, providing holographic duals of strongly coupled disordered systems. At intermediate temperatures these geometries display highly inhomogeneous horizons, though their geometric averages reproduce the clean BTZ and Reissner-Nordström solutions. The low temperature behavior, however, differs sharply between dimensions. In AdS$_3$, inhomogeneities decay and the horizon flows to the clean charged BTZ fixed point, rendering disorder irrelevant in the infrared. In AdS$_4$, horizon inhomogeneities persist: while the averaged geometry flows to the clean AdS$_2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ throat, the disordered horizon induces a finite residual resistivity. These results show that disorder can qualitatively alter the IR physics of holographic metals and indicate violations of the Harris criterion in strongly coupled systems.",
Cross submissions,Short GRB 090510: a magnetized neutron star binary merger leading to a black hole,"J. A. Rueda,R. Ruffini,Yu Wang",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We model the short gamma-ray bursts (GRB) 090510 as the product of a magnetized neutron star (NS) binary merger. Accounting for the NS critical mass constraint given by the mass of PSR J0952--0607, we infer that GRB 090510 was a highly-magnetized NS-NS merger that left as remnant a Kerr black hole (BH) of $2.4 M_\odot$ with a low-mass accretion disk. The gamma-ray precursor is powered by the magnetic energy released during the merger of the NSs. The prompt emission originates at the transparency of an ultra-relativistic $e^+e^-$ pair-plasma produced by the overcritical electric field induced by the rotating strong magnetic field around the merged object before it reaches the critical mass, the GeV emission by the extractable energy of the newborn BH, and the X-ray afterglow by accretion onto it. We derive the masses of the merging NSs, their magnetic fields, the BH mass, spin, and irreducible mass, the strength of the magnetic field, the disk mass, and obtain an estimate of the gravitational-wave emission during the merger phase preceding the prompt short GRB emission. The inferred parameters agree with up-to-date numerical relativity simulations, confirming that strong magnetic fields above $10^{14}$ G develop in NS-NS mergers and that mergers leading to a central BH remnant have low-mass disks of $\sim 10^{-2} M_\odot$. We also advance the possibility that quasi-period oscillations of tens of Hz of frequency due to Lense-Thirring precession of the matter surrounding the merged object before BH formation can explain the successive spikes following the prompt emission peak.",
Cross submissions,Multiverse Predictions for Habitability: Fundamental Physics and Galactic Habitability,McCullen Sandora,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the multiverse hypothesis, a range of universes exist with differing values of our physical constants. Here, we investigate how the probabilities of observing our values of these constants depend on the assumptions made about the theories governing particle physics and cosmology, along with habitability. The particle physics effects we consider include constraints on the Higgs vacuum expectation value from big bang nucleosynthesis and supernovae, grand unified theories (GUTs), and standard model stability. Cosmology effects we consider are different theories of dark matter and baryogenesis, and for galactic habitability effects we include star formation efficiency, stellar encounters, supernova explosions, and active galactic nuclei. We find the following to be disfavored in the multiverse scenario: flexible GUTs, pessimistic galactic disruption rates, some origin of life theories, and freeze-out dark matter with high energy baryogenesis. These predictions can be tested in future experiments to either confirm or rule out the multiverse.",
Cross submissions,The Hierarchical Merger Scenario for GW231123,"Guo-Peng Li,Xi-Long Fan",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"GW231123 exhibits exceedingly massive components and high spins, which challenges the formation of first-generation (1G) black holes from stellar collapse and implies that this event might originate from hierarchical mergers. Here we show that the \texttt{2G+2G} merger scenario for GW231123 is favored over a \texttt{2G+1G} (or \texttt{3G+2G}) merger, with odds ratios of $>$$\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. The primary (secondary) black hole is consistent with merging binary black holes with masses of $75^{+7}_{-7}\,M_\odot$ and $66^{+4}_{-10}\,M_\odot$ ($64^{+8}_{-10}\,M_\odot$ and $59^{+7}_{-9}\,M_\odot$; 90\% credible intervals), respectively. Our results reveal that the treatment of spin priors from the population level and waveform model choice are decisive in interpreting potential hierarchical gravitational-wave signals.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational constant as a conserved charge in black hole thermodynamics,"Wontae Kim,Mungon Nam",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent work has demonstrated that coupling constants in a given action can be promoted to the role of conserved charges. This is achieved by introducing pairs of field variables constructed from combinations of scalar and gauge fields. This framework naturally suggests that the gravitational constant itself can be interpreted as a conserved charge, arising from an associated gauge symmetry. In a modified four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action, we explicitly show that the gravitational constant, in addition to the mass and the cosmological constant, emerges as a conserved charge. Our derivation, which employs the quasi-local off-shell ADT formalism, yields a result that is fully consistent with the extended thermodynamic first law and the Smarr formula.",
Cross submissions,The gyromagnetic factor of charged rotating black holes in various dimensions from scattering amplitudes,"Claudio Gambino,Fabio Riccioni,Victor Sanz Sanchis",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Classical black hole spacetimes can be recovered from the classical limit of quantum scattering amplitudes in a low-energy effective field theory of gravity. In this work we compute, at first post-Minkowskian and dipole order, the metric and the electromagnetic potential for charged and rotating black holes in general spacetime dimensions from amplitudes describing the emission of either a graviton or a photon from a massive and charged Dirac fermion field up to one loop. In addition, we introduce a Pauli non-minimal coupling, to parametrize the black hole's gyromagnetic factor $\mathfrak{g}$. We are able to reproduce the Kerr-Newman solution in four dimensions, as well as the Chong-Cvetič-Lü-Pope solution, from five-dimensional supergravity, which includes a Chern-Simons interaction. Crucially, we show that for a charged Myers-Perry like black hole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions, its gyromagnetic factor is equal to $\mathfrak{g}=(d-1)/(d-2)$. Hence, only in $3+1$ dimensions minimal coupling is sufficient to describe black holes from scattering amplitudes.",
Cross submissions,Saturation of Pauli blocking in near-extremal charged Nariai black holes,"Chiang-Mei Chen,Chun-Chih Huang,Sang Pyo Kim",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We solve the Dirac equation for a massive charged fermion in the near-extremal charged Nariai black hole with the near-horizon geometry $\mathrm{dS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2$. At the one-loop level, contrary to the catastrophic emission of charged spinless bosons in [C.-M. Chen \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. D 110, 085020 (2024)], we show that the emission of fermions in a narrow time-like inner region between the cosmological horizon and black hole horizon saturates the bound from the Pauli blocking and does not give an amplification (quantum superradiance). Using the reciprocal relation, we find the Schwinger emission of fermions from $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2$, and compare the Schwinger emission of fermions and bosons from near-extremal Nariai black holes.",
Cross submissions,Analytical and Numerical Analysis of QPO Frequencies in Quantum-Corrected Black Hole Spacetimes,"Ahmad Al-Badawi,Faizuddin Ahmed,Orhan Donmez,Fatih Dogan,Behnam Pourhassan,İzzet Sakallı,Yassine Sekhmani",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This investigation examines QPOs in two quantum-corrected BH spacetimes that preserve general covariance while incorporating quantum gravitational effects through a dimensionless parameter \zeta. We combine analytical derivations of epicyclic frequencies with comprehensive numerical simulations of BHL accretion to explore how quantum corrections manifest in observable astrophysical phenomena. Using a fiducial BH mass of M=10M_\odot representative of stellar-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that the two models exhibit fundamentally different behaviors: Model-I modifies both temporal and radial metric components, leading to innermost stable circular orbit migration proportional to \zeta^4 and dramatic stagnation point evolution from 27M to 5M as quantum corrections strengthen. Model-II preserves the classical temporal component while altering only spatial geometry, maintaining constant stagnation points and stable cavity structures throughout the parameter range. Our numerical simulations reveal distinct QPO generation mechanisms, with Model-I showing systematic frequency evolution and cavity shrinkage that suppresses oscillations for \zeta \geq 3M, while Model-II maintains stable low-frequency modes up to \zeta \geq 5M. Power spectral density analyzes demonstrate characteristic frequency ratios (3:2, 2:1, 5:3) consistent with observations from X-ray binaries, providing specific targets for discriminating between quantum correction scenarios. The hydrodynamically derived constraints (\zeta \lesssim 4M) show remarkable agreement with independent EHT limits for M87* and Sgr A*, validating our theoretical framework through multiple observational channels. These results establish QPO frequency analysis as a probe for detecting quantum gravitational effects in astrophysical BHs and demonstrate the complementary nature of timing and imaging observations in constraining fundamental physics.",

Richardson",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the last decade, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the European Virgo observatory have opened a new observational window on the universe. These cavity-enhanced laser interferometers sense spacetime strain, generated by distant astrophysical events such as black hole mergers, to an RMS fluctuation of a few parts in $10^{21}$ over a multi-kilometer baseline. Optical advancements in laser wavefront control are key to advancing the sensitivity of current detectors and enabling a planned next-generation 40-km gravitational wave observatory in the United States, known as Cosmic Explorer. We report the first experimental demonstration of a new wavefront control technique for gravitational-wave detection, obtained from testing a full-scale prototype on a 40-kg LIGO mirror. Our results indicate that this design can meet the unique and challenging requirements of providing higher-order precision wavefront corrections at megawatt laser power levels, while introducing extremely low effective displacement noise into the interferometer. This new technology will have a direct and enabling impact on the observational science, expanding the gravitational-wave detection horizon to very early times in the universe, before the first stars formed, and enabling new tests of gravity, cosmology, and dense nuclear matter.",
