New submissions,Mass inflation from rough initial data for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system with $Λ$,Flavio Rossetti,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"Recent rigorous results on black hole interiors clearly suggest that the strong cosmic censorship conjecture fails in its most fundamental, i.e. weak, formulation: violations are expected for a class of spherically symmetric charged black holes in the presence of a positive cosmological constant near extremality. These results require sufficiently regular solutions. Conversely, when non-smooth, finite-energy initial data are prescribed for linear waves propagating on a fixed black hole background belonging to the aforementioned family, it was shown that the local energy of these linear waves blows up at the Cauchy horizon, hence hinting that non-smooth initial data may suppress the possible violations of the $H^1$ formulation of strong cosmic censorship. In line with this intuition, we prove that rough initial data can also trigger an instability at the Cauchy horizon in the non-linear setting, via mass inflation. In particular, we analyse a characteristic initial value problem for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar field system describing the interior of a black hole. Our results show that, when prescribing 1) initial data asymptotically approaching those of a sub-extremal Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter solution, and 2) initial data belonging to $W^{1, 2}\setminus W^{1, q}$, for every $q > 2$, along the initial ingoing compact segment; then the Hawking mass diverges at the Cauchy horizon of the black hole solution we construct, for every parameter choice of the reference black hole. In this larger family of configurations, we prove that the smooth data suggesting violations of strong cosmic censorship are non-generic in a ``positive co-dimension'' sense, conditionally to the validity of the expected Price law bounds. Moreover, we illustrate the transition between smooth and rough initial data.",
New submissions,TDI on the fly,"Neil J. Cornish,Tyson Littenberg",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories, such as the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), employ synthetic Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) to cancel the otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise. The phase readouts at each spacecraft are combined with a carefully designed collection of time delays that cancel the laser frequency noise. The same collection of time delays must be applied to the GW signal models used for analysis, along with geometrical factors that encode the projection of the wave polarization tensor onto the arms of the interferometer. In principle, fully generic TDI calculations require the GW signal model to be evaluated at dozens of delay times for each data sample, a process that would require tens of millions of evaluations for a year-long signal. Here, a new method is presented that cuts the computational cost by a factor of ten thousand compared to a direct implementation at the data sample cadence, while incurring no loss in accuracy. The approach works for completely general spacecraft orbits and any flavor of TDI.",
New submissions,Cosmic Hysteresis in $f(R)$ Gravity: A Thermodynamic Perspective on Cyclic Bouncing Universes,Aritra Sanyal,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the emergence of cosmic hysteresis in cyclic bouncing cosmologies within the framework of $f(R)$ modified gravity theories. Building upon previous studies that explored hysteresis phenomena in braneworld and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we analyze how scalar field dynamics coupled to a modified gravitational background generates asymmetric pressure evolution during expansion and contraction phases. This asymmetry manifests as a non-vanishing work integral over complete cosmic cycles, $\oint p\,dV \neq 0$, which we interpret as a fundamental thermodynamic signature of irreversible cyclic evolution. We derive the modified Friedmann equations for a representative $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$ model, establish analytical conditions for bounce and turnaround events, and quantify the thermodynamic work performed during each cycle through comprehensive numerical analysis. Our findings demonstrate that hysteresis effects are generic features of scalar-tensor dynamics in higher-curvature gravity theories and can drive cumulative evolution of the cosmic scale factor across multiple cycles, potentially providing new insights into the resolution of cosmological singularities and the thermodynamic arrow of time in modified gravity frameworks.",
New submissions,DSR-relativistic spacetime picture and the phenomenology of Planck-scale-modified time dilation,"Giovanni Amelino-Camelia,Giulia Gubitosi,Pietro Pellecchia,Marco Refuto,Giacomo Rosati",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The most active area of research in quantum-gravity phenomenology investigates the possibility of Planck-scale-modified dispersion relations, focusing mainly on two alternative scenarios: the ""LIV"" scenario, characterized by a specific mechanism of breakdown of relativistic symmetries, and the ""DSR"" scenario, which preserves overall relativistic invariance but with deformed laws of relativistic transformation. Two recent studies of modified dispersion relations, one relying on Finsler geometry and one based on heuristic reasoning, raised the possibility of potentially observable effects for time dilation and argued that this might apply also to the LIV and DSR scenarios. We observe that the description of Lorentz transformations in the LIV scenario is such that time dilation cannot be modified. The DSR scenario allows for modifications of time dilation, and establishing their magnitude required us to obtain novel results on the effects of finite DSR boosts in the spacetime sector, with results showing in particular that the modification of time dilation is too small for experimental testing.",
New submissions,Anisotropic quantum polytropes,"Hermano Velten,Felipe S. Escórcio,Nadson J. S. Trindade",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The structure of astrophysical objects is usually modeled under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, actual configurations may deviate from perfect spherical or isotropic properties. Consequently, cosmic objects are expected to exhibit some degree of anisotropy. This consideration also extends to hypothetical dark structures, such as dark stars and dark matter halos. Although the nature of dark matter remains unknown, axion-like particles (ALPs) are strong candidates, suggesting that dark matter halos may have originated from bosonic configurations undergoing gravitational collapse, sustained by boson-boson interactions in the condensate state. This system is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation. Furthermore, within the framework of the Bohm-de Broglie approach, quantum effects,encapsulated in the so-called quantum potential, may play a significant role in equilibrium astrophysical configurations. In this study, we examine a class of static anisotropic boson stars which are non-minimally coupled to gravity. By including all these factors, we derive a generalized Lane-Emden-like equation and conduct a detailed analysis of the maximum degree of anisotropy that such systems can sustain, thereby identifying physically viable equilibrium configurations. Apart from focusing on the impact of anisotropic contributions, we find that for the so-called Quantum Polytropes (when the quantum potential is the main responsible for the equilibrium condition), the anisotropic factor and the gravitational field have opposite roles compared to the classical case. This leads to a new class of hydrostatic equilibrium objects.",
New submissions,GW170817 Viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation Compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data,"S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we investigate several Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models that are compatible with the GW170817 event, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the BICEP/Keck updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We consider two distinct classes of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories, which are equally successful for GW170817-compatible model building and we examine their viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The two models are distinct since the first class relates directly the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function with the scalar potential and yields $c_T^2=1$ while in the second class, the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function and the scalar potential are freely but conveniently chosen and the class of models respects the constraint $\left| c_T^2 - 1 \right| < 6 \times 10^{-15}$. We provide several examples of models belonging to both the two classes of GW170817-compatible Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories and we demonstrate that Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories provide a promising theoretical framework for inflationary dynamics.",
New submissions,Vacuum Homogeneous and Nonhomogeneous Metrics with Conventional and Quantized Metric Tensor: Singular or Nonsingular Solution,"A. Tawfik(Egyptian Ctr. Theor. Phys., Cairo and Future U. in Egypt),S. G. Elgendi(Islamic U. in Madinah),M. Hanafy(Benha U.)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"To investigate whether the Universe underwent a singularity or maintained a nonsingular state, we carry out analytical and numerical analyses of the evolution of the Raychaudhuri equations in vacuum, alongside homogeneous and nonhomogeneous cosmic backgrounds. The results obtained from the Schwarzschild, Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW), and Einstein--Gilbert--Straus (EGS) metrics are systematically compared. Analyzing the results from both, conventional and quantized metric tensor, it revealed insights into the nature of initial and spatial singularities. Results associated with the Schwarzschild metric demonstrate a positive evolution that corresponds with a reduction in radial distance (nonsingularity). In contrast, the proposed quantization reverses this trend, leading to a negative evolution (singularity). The situation is similar for the FLRW metric, where the suggested quantization results in a positive evolution as cosmic time decreases, in contrast to the classical and conventional metrics, which are associated with negative evolution. The analysis of the EGS metric reveals that classical evolution remains positively oriented, particularly with a reduction in radial distance. Moreover, the introduction of quantized and conventional metric tensors fully retrains the cosmic time dependence. The results obtained are a rightful recognition of the substantial efforts dedicated to the establishment of the Swiss-cheese model, demonstrating that the EGS metric indeed facilitates the temporal and spatial development of our Universe.",
New submissions,Prospects for High-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Detection with GEO600,"Christopher M. Jungkind,Brian C. Seymour,Andrew Laeuger,Yanbei Chen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Current ground-based interferometers are optimized for sensitivity from a few tens of Hz to about 1 kHz. While they are not currently utilized for GW detection, interferometric detectors also feature narrow bands of strong sensitivity at higher frequencies where the sideband fields created by a GW are resonantly amplified in the optical system. For certain interferometer configurations, small changes to system parameters allow the narrow band of high sensitivity to be scanned over a much larger range of frequencies, potentially enabling broadband detection at high frequencies. In this paper, we investigate whether simply modifying the detuning angle of the signal-recycling mirror of the GEO600 interferometer can make this experiment sensitive to GWs in the kilohertz frequency range. We compute the strain sensitivity for GEO600 across a frequency range from several kHz to tens of kHz for various detuning angles. We also show that LIGO cannot attain the same effect assuming that the optical components are not changed due to the narrow band response of the Fabry-Perot cavities. We then calculate the sensitivity of GEO600 to various proposed high-frequency GW sources and compare it to the sensitivity of other ground-based detectors.",
New submissions,A discussion on the symmetry of relativistic Vlasov gas and its accretion in Kerr-Newman black hole,Yong-qiang Liu,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the kinetic properties of collisionless Vlasov gas in Kerr-Newman spacetime, focusing on how spacetime symmetries constrain the distribution functions. By establishing the general relationship between distribution functions and constants of motion (mass $m$, energy $E$, angular momentum $L_z$, Carter constant $L$) along with $L$'s conjugate configuration variable $Q^{3}$, we derive the analytical framework for particle dynamics in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. Within the Locally Non-Rotating Frame , we compute key observables -- particle number density, energy density, principal pressures, and accretion rates -- resolving coordinate divergences near the event horizon through geometric rescaling. For a plasma obeying the Jüttner distribution, asymptotic expressions at spatial infinity are explicitly calculated. Numerical analyses reveal: (1) mass and energy accretion rates exhibit nearly identical parametric dependencies on black hole parameters; (2) extremal Kerr-Newman black holes show monotonic enhancement in mass, energy, and angular momentum accretion rates with increasing $a$, contrasting with Kerr black hole behavior. These results provide new insights into accretion mechanisms in extreme spacetime geometries.",
New submissions,Universality on thermodynamic relation with corrections in Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity Black hole,"Hai-Long Zhen,Huai-Fan Li,Yu-Bo Ma",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The generalized thermodynamic extremum relation, as proposed by Goon and Penco, establishes a novel theoretical framework for the study of spacetime thermodynamics. However, extant investigations generally assume that the black hole state parameter is solely a first-order function of the perturbation parameter when exploring the Goon-Penco relation in diverse spacetime contexts. An analytic expression for the perturbation parameter as a function of the black hole entropy can be expressed by treating the black hole mass as constant. The present study addresses this limitation and provides insight into the universal Goon-Penco relation when multiple thermodynamic state parameters behave as higher order functions of the perturbation parameters. Notably, we have not only established a universal relational formula in the case of multiple state variables, but more importantly, we have put forward an innovative conjecture that reveals the existence of a universal relation between displaced thermodynamic quantities in spacetime in the context of an arbitrary black hole. These theoretical breakthroughs are expected to open up new exploration directions for quantum gravity research.",
New submissions,Non-Hermitian Gravitational Wave Scattering,"Burak Pekduran,Mustafa Sarısaman,Ekrem Aydıner",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In this study, the non-Hermitian scattering of gravitational waves is examined, and their behavior at spectral singularities is discussed. We investigate the non-Hermitian properties of gravitational waves through the construction of a transfer matrix. By examining spectral singularity points obtained from the transfer matrix, we explore the behavior of gravitational waves at these spectral singularity points and compare the theoretical results with observed measurements. Our findings demonstrate that the frequency values of gravitational waves measured on Earth at spectral singularity points exhibit perfect agreement with the corresponding Hubble constant values. This alignment underscores the significance of the non-Hermitian characteristics of gravitational waves. We anticipate that this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of non-Hermitian phenomena in gravitational physics and provide a foundation for future studies in the field.",
New submissions,Impact of nonlinearities on relativistic dynamical tides in compact binary inspirals,"Tristan Pitre,Eric Poisson",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The tidal deformation of a neutron star in a binary inspiral driven by the emission of gravitational waves affects the orbital dynamics and produces a measurable modulation of the waves. Late in the inspiral, a regime of dynamical tides takes over from a prior regime of static tides. A recent analysis by Yu et al. [M.N.R.A.S. 519, 4325 (2022)] reveals that nonlinear aspects of the tidal interaction are important during the regime of dynamical tides. Their theoretical framework is grounded in Newtonian gravity and fluid mechanics, and relies on a representation of the tidal deformation in terms of the star's normal modes of vibration. We confirm their observation in a general relativistic treatment of the tidal deformation of a neutron star, without relying on a mode representation of this deformation. The starting point of our description is a simultaneous time-derivative and nonlinear expansion of the tidal deformation, expressed in terms of three encapsulating constants, the static $k_2$, dynamic $\ddot{k}_2$, and nonlinear $p_2$ tidal constants. We describe the neutron star's deformation in terms of a well-defined quadrupole moment tensor, which is related to the tidal quadrupole moment through a frequency-domain response function $\tilde{k}_2(\omega)$. In a pragmatic extension of our simultaneous expansion, we express this in a form proportional to $(1-\omega^2/\omega_*^2)^{-1}$, the characteristic response of a harmonic oscillator subjected to a driving force of frequency $\omega$, with a natural-frequency parameter $\omega_*$ constructed from the tidal constants. We compute these for polytropic stellar models, and show that the nonlinear constant $p_2$ lowers the frequency parameter by as much as 15% relative to an estimation based on a purely linear treatment of the tidal deformation.",
New submissions,Quantum Effective Dynamics of Papapetrou Spacetime,"Xiaokan Guo,Faqiang Yuan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate the quantum effective dynamics of Papapetrou spacetime by using methods from loop quantum gravity. The Papapetrou spacetime is an extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime with an extra coupled anti-scalar field. By solving the equations of motion generated by the Hamiltonian constraint for Papapetrou spacetime, we can construct the quantum effective metric. The resulting effective metric for the quantum-corrected Papapetrou spacetime demonstrates the quantum effects inevitably give rise to a new wormhole throat while the classical wormhole throat disappear in the case of extremely small mass.",
New submissions,Gravitational-wave generation in the presence of Lorentz invariance violation,"Samy Aoulad Lafkih,Marie-Christine Angonin,Christophe Le Poncin-Lafitte,Nils Albin Nilsson",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We solve the wave equation for gravitational waves emitted by compact objects systems using the Multipolar Post-Minkowskian (MPM) method, and in the presence of Lorentz invariance violating terms. We select a Lorentz-violating extension of General Relativity in the pure gravity sector, directly taken from the Standard Model Extension (SME) formalism, and derive the wave equation for metric perturbation from the modified Einstein equation. We solve it with the MPM method and compute the gauge-invariant Riemann tensor components governing the geodesic deviation. Finally we compare the leading order term of the perturbative scheme in the small SME coefficients, with the leading order of the General Relativity. We outline the benefits and difficulties of this method. All the results are given as functionals of a set of general PM moments that can be matched to the physical properties of the source. These results are a first step toward putting state-of-the-art constraints on symmetries violations with new gravitational wave detectors like LISA.",
New submissions,"Waveform model for the $(\ell=2, m=0)$ spherical harmonic and the displacement memory contribution from precessing binary black holes","Maria Rosselló-Sastre,Sascha Husa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper we construct the first phenomenological waveform model which contains the ""complete"" $\ell=2$ spherical harmonic mode content for gravitational wave signals emitted by the coalescence of binary black holes with spin precession: The model contains the dominant part of the gravitational wave displacement memory, which manifests in the $(\ell=2, m=0)$ spherical harmonic in a co-precessing frame, as well as the oscillatory component of this mode. The model is constructed by twisting up the oscillatory contribution of the mode, as it was previously done for the rest of spherical harmonic modes in IMRPhenomTPHM and the Phenom family of waveform models. Regarding the displacement memory contribution present in the aligned spin (2,0) mode, we discuss a procedure to analytically compute the ""precessing memory"" in all the $\ell=2$ modes using the integration derived from the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs balance laws. The final waveform of the (2,0) mode is then obtained by summing together both contributions. We implement this as an extension of the computationally efficient IMRPhenomTPHM waveform model, and we test its accuracy by comparing against a set of Numerical Relativity simulations. Finally, we employ the model to perform a Bayesian parameter estimation injection analysis.",
Cross submissions,"Quantum gravity observables: observation, algebras, and mathematical structure",Steven B. Giddings,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The questions of describing observables and observation in quantum gravity appear to be centrally important to its physics. A relational approach holds significant promise, and a classification of different types of relational observables (gravitationally dressed, field relational, and more general) is outlined. Plausibly gravitationally dressed observables are particularly closely tied to the fundamental structure of the theory. These may be constructed in the quantum theory to leading order in Newton's constant, and raise important questions about localization of information. Approximate localization is given by a ""standard dressing"" construction of a ""gravitational splitting."" It is also argued that such gravitational dressings give a generalization of the crossed product construction, reducing to this and yielding type II von Neumann algebras in special cases. Gravity therefore introduces a significantly more general alteration of the algebraic structure of local quantum field theory, also with apparent connections to holography, but whose implications have not been fully understood. In particular, properties of the algebra of gravitationally dressed observables suggest a possible role for other non-algebraic structure on the Hilbert space for quantum gravity.",
Cross submissions,Turbulence in Magnetised Neutron Stars,"William Cook,Raj Kishor Joshi,Sebastiano Bernuzzi,Brynmor Haskell,Jacob Fields",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The magnetic field configuration in the interior of neutron stars and its stability are open problems and may be impacted by the influence of a turbulent cascade within the star. Assessing the impact of turbulent flow with numerical simulations requires incredibly high resolution as well as long lived simulations covering multiple Alfven times. We present a series of simulations of magnetised neutron stars with resolution up to 29m and lasting at their longest 1.2s to assess this issue, the longest lasting and highest resolution such simulations to date. At the highest resolution we find evidence for a turbulent cascade absent in an unmagnetised star which cannot be captured with lower resolution simulations, consistent with Kolmogorov power law scaling. The presence of turbulence triggers an inverse cascade of helicity, while at late times the net helicity appears to vanish, suggesting that a twisted-torus is not formed in the magnetic field. We find that the presence of the magnetic field excites a characteristic quadrupolar oscillation of the density profile at 145 Hz, consistent with Alfvenic modes proposed as the source of quasi-periodic oscillations observed in magnetars.",
Cross submissions,Perturbative Kähler Moduli Inflation,"Mishaal Hai,Ahmed Rakin Kamal,Noshin Ferdous Shamma,Md Shaikot Jahan Shuvo",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this work, we present two classes of inflationary models in the framework of type IIB string theory. The inflatons correspond to blow-up Kähler modulus arising from compactifying type IIB on a Calabi-Yau. Using perturbative corrections, we first highlight a procedure for stabilising more than one Kähler modulus. For the case of two Kähler moduli, we explicitly construct two class of inflationary potentials within the Kähler cone which satisfy both EFT and cosmological constraints. The first class of models, arising from moduli redefinition of the blow-up mode, have a potential of the form $V(\phi)=V_0(1+C_1 \phi^{2/3})$ align with CMB data with scalar-to-tensor ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-2}$. The second class of models, which have been recently proposed in the name of loop blow-up inflation, have a form $V(\phi)=V_0(1+C_2\phi^{-2/3})$ also agrees with CMB data with scalar-to tensor-ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-8}$.",

Cross submissions,Revealing Dark Matter's Role in Neutron Stars Anisotropy: A Bayesian Approach Using Multi-messenger Observations,"Xue-Zhi Liu,Premachand Mahapatra,Chun Huang,Ayush Hazarika,Chiranjeeb Singha,Prasanta Kumar Das",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs) serve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their structure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\sim10\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\Delta R_\chi \equiv R_{\chi,\mathrm{max}} - R_{\chi,\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\Delta R_\chi < 4\,\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current limitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star observations.",
Cross submissions,Behaviour of $α$-attractors in Warm Inflation,"Dibya Chakraborty,Suratna Das",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation have remained one of the preferred inflationary models for nearly a decade now. The unique attractor nature of these models in the $n_s-r$ plane have put these models in the sweet-spot of the $n_s-r$ measurement of Planck observations. In this article, we analyse the behaviour of such attractor models in a Warm Inflation setup to investigate whether the attractor nature of these models can be retained even when the dynamics deviates from the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. We have chosen to analyse these models in a strongly dissipative Warm inflation setup, namely the Minimal Warm Inflation, as in such a setup the inflationary dynamics significantly departs from the standard Cold inflation dynamics. We observe that the departure from the standard Cold inflation dynamics destroys the unique attractor nature of such models. The analysis clearly indicates that the attractor nature of these $\alpha$-attractor models is quite unique to the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. However, on a positive note, the analysis indicates that the $\alpha$-attractor models may be made in tune with the recent ACT results in Warm inflation for certain parameter ranges.",
Cross submissions,Radiation-Reaction on the Straight-Line Motion of a Point Charge accelerated by a constant applied Electric Field in an Electromagnetic Bopp-Landé-Thomas-Podolsky vacuum,"Ryan J. McGuigan,Michael K.-H. Kiessling",Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Landé--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720[this http URL-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\varkappa c t \ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.",

By cross-correlating the dispersion of background FRBs with the locations of foreground galaxies, we can study the relative spatial distributions of plasma and galaxies on scales of 0.1 to 50 Mpc, which are strongly affected by feedback processes in galaxy formation. Here we present the measurement of the dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy angular cross-power spectrum between 2873 FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog and nearly 6 million galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Over five photometric galaxy redshift bins spanning $0.05 < z <0.5$ and at 5.1$\sigma$ significance, we make the first definitive detection of spatial correlations in FRB dispersion measure due to cosmic structure. While parameter inferences should be interpreted with caution because of incomplete modelling of both the signal and systematic errors, our data indicate that the plasma$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy cross-power spectrum cuts off relative to the matter power spectrum at a scale $k_\textrm{cut}^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\,\textrm{Mpc}$. This scale is consistent with those X-ray stacking analyses that suggest dark-matter halos with group-scale masses are largely evacuated of their baryons by feedback processes. Our study demonstrates that FRBs are promising tools to discern the physics of baryonic structure formation and will only become more powerful as FRB surveys expand.",
Cross submissions,One loop corrections to the thermodynamics of near-extremal Kerr-(A)dS black holes from Heun equation,"Paolo Arnaudo,Giulio Bonelli,Alessandro Tanzini",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We compute one-loop corrections to the euclidean gravitational path integral of near-extremal (anti-)de Sitter-Kerr black hole in terms of the connection coefficients of the Heun equation describing the black hole linear perturbations in the Teukolsky formalism. We show that different near-extremal limits lead to distinct physical properties of the gravitational configuration, as they get described by distinct limiting differential equations. As a result, the light modes emerging in the limit determine different scaling properties in the temperature of the one-loop determinants. We show that the cold case displays distinctive universal log(T) corrections to the entropy of the system, including the ultracold regime. On the contrary, these do not appear in the limit in which the event horizon superimposes onto the cosmological one. In the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case, a further check is performed by comparison with the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev formula.",
Cross submissions,Finslerian lightconvex boundaries: applications to causal simplicity and the space of cone geodesics $\mathcal{N}$,"Jónatan Herrera,Miguel Sánchez",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Our outcome is structured in the following sequence: (1) a general result for indefinite Finslerian manifolds with boundary $(M,L)$ showing the equivalence between local and infinitesimal (time, light or space) convexities for the boundary $\partial M$, (2) for any cone structure $(M,\mathcal{C})$ which is globally hyperbolic with timelike boundary, the equivalence among: (a) the boundary $\partial M$ is lightconvex, (b) the interior $\mathring{M}$ is causally simple and (c) the space of the cone (null) geodesics $\mathcal{N}$ of $(\mathring{M},\mathcal{C})$ is Hausdorff, (3) in this case, the manifold structure of $\mathcal{N}$ is obtained explicitly in terms of elements in $\partial M$ and a smooth Cauchy hypersurface $S$, (4) the known results and examples about Hausdorfness of $\mathcal{N}$ are revisited and extended, leading to the notion of {\em causally simple spacetime with $T_2$-lightspace} as a step in the causal ladder below global hyperbolicity.The results are significant for relativistic (Lorentz) spacetimes and the writing allows one either to be introduced in Finslerian technicalities or to skip them. In particular, asymptotically AdS spacetimes become examples where the $C^{1,1}$ conformal extensions at infinity yield totally lightgeodesic boundaries, and all the results above apply.",
