New submissions,Connection stability of vector fields with astrophysical application to the Einstein-Vlasov system,"Mohammadreza Molaei,Christian Corda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In this paper we present a method for considering the stability of smooth vector fields on a smooth manifold which may not be compact. We show that these kind of stability which is called ""connection stability"" is equivalent to the structural stability in the case of compact manifolds. We prove if X is a connection stable vector field, then any multiplication of it by a nonzero scalar is also a connection stable vector field. We present an example of a connection stable vector field on a noncompact manifold, and we also show that harmonic oscillator is not a connection stable vector field. We present a technique to prove a class of vector fields are not connection stable. As a concrete physical example, we will apply the analysis to the Einstein- Vlasov system in an astrophysical context in which we propose an approach that could, in principle and partially, help to understand the problem of galaxy rotation curves.",
New submissions,Dynamical evolution and stability of quantum corrected Schwarzschild black holes in semiclassical gravity,Ben Kain,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The Schwarzschild solution describes a classical static black hole in general relativity. When general relativity is extended by including semiclassical corrections in the form of a renormalized energy-momentum tensor, the horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole disappears and is replaced by a wormhole. We study the stability of this quantum corrected static Schwarzschild solution in semiclassical gravity by using it as the initial data of a dynamical evolution. We find that the quantum corrected solution is unstable and that the wormhole can expand or collapse when perturbed. In vacuum, the wormhole expands, but in the presence of even a small amount of classical matter, the wormhole collapses, forming a horizon and evolving to an evaporating black hole.",
New submissions,Black-hole - neutron-star mergers: new numerical-relativity simulations and multipolar effective-one-body model with spin precession and eccentricity,"Alejandra Gonzalez,Sebastiano Bernuzzi,Alireza Rashti,Francesco Brandoli,Rossella Gamba",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"In this paper, we present 52 new numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole-neutron-star merger (BHNS) mergers and employ the data to inform TEOBResumS-Dalí: a multipolar effective-one-body model also including precession and eccentricity. Our simulations target quasicircular mergers and the parameter space region characterized by significant tidal disruption of the star. Convergent gravitational waveforms are produced with a detailed error budget after extensive numerical tests. We study in detail the multipolar amplitude hierarchy and identify a characteristic tidal signature in the $(\ell,m)=(2,0)$, and $(3,0)$ modes. We also develop new NR-informed models for the remnant black hole and for the recoil velocity. The numerical data is then used to inform next-to-quasicircular corrections and the ringdown of TEOBResumS-Dalí for BHNS. We show an overall order of magnitude improvement in the waveform's amplitude at merger and more consistent multipoles over our older TEOBResumS-GIOTTO for BHNS. TEOBResumS-Dalí is further validated with a new 12 orbit precessing simulation, showing phase and relative amplitude differences below $\sim 0.5$ (rad) throughout the inspiral. The computed mismatches including all the modes lie at the one percent level for low inclinations. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time that TEOBResumS-Dalí can produce robust waveforms with both eccentricity and precession, and use the model to identify the most urgent BHNS to simulate for waveform development. Our new numerical data are publicly released as part of the CoRe database.",
New submissions,Modeling Gravitational Wave Modes from Binaries with Arbitrary Eccentricity,Gonzalo Morras,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Eccentric binaries are key targets for current and future gravitational wave (GW) detectors, offering unique insights into the formation and environments of compact binaries. However, accurately and efficiently modeling eccentric waveforms remains challenging, in part due to their complex harmonic structure. In this work, we develop a post-Newtonian (PN) framework to compute the Fourier amplitudes of GWs from eccentric binaries, deriving simple expressions at 1PN order for all relevant $(l, m)$ multipoles, valid for arbitrary eccentricities. We then characterize the GW emission by analyzing the contribution of each $(l, m)$ mode to the strain, its mean frequency, frequency spread, and asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. Additionally, we introduce a method to determine the minimal set of Fourier modes needed to reconstruct the waveform to a given accuracy. Finally, we also discuss how our framework can be extended to higher PN orders, obtaining closed-form expressions for the leading-order tail and spin contributions and outlining the steps required to include higher-order corrections. Our results provide both a deeper theoretical understanding of eccentric GW emission and practical tools for developing more accurate and efficient waveform models.",
New submissions,New Directions in Gravity Searches for Spacetime-Symmetry breaking,Quentin G. Bailey,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this talk, we review recent results in testing spacetime symmetries in gravitational physics. Topics discussed include new signals for hypothetical Lorentz and diffeomorphism symmetry violations in short-range gravity tests. We review results for multipole expansions that predict extra polarizations for gravitational waves. Both explicit and spontaneous spacetime-symmetry breaking origins are considered. We also discuss recent numerical results for black hole solutions in a vector field model of spontaneous symmetry breaking.",
New submissions,"Cosmological implications of hybrid metric-Palatini $f(\mathcal{R},\mc{R}_{μν}\mc{R}^{μν})$ gravity","Shahab Shahidi,Shiva Kayedi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with Lagrangian density $L =R+f(\mathcal{R},\mc{R}_{\mu\nu}\mc{R}^{\mu\nu})$ is considered, where $R$ is the metric Ricci scalar and $\mc{R}_{\mu\nu}$ is the Palatini Ricci tensor. Contrary to the standard hybrid metric-Palatini theory, because of the term $\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{R}^{\mu\nu}$ in the action, the model can not be analytically transformed to a scalar-tensor theory. However, on top of a maximally symmetric space-times like the FRW universe, there is a way to solve for a metric compatible connection which we will follow in this paper. The cosmological implications of the resulting model will then be fully considered. The best fit values of the model and cosmological parameters will be obtained by confronting the model with the recent observational data on the Hubble parameter. We will see that the observational data can be explained very good in this model, but, significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model could be seen in derivatives of the Hubble parameter $q$, $j$ and $s$. We will perform a statefinder analysis for the model and show that its behavior differs from that of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Also, we will consider the recently proposed $Om$ diagnostics to categorize the dark energy type of the model and obtain the $\omega$-varying alternative of the model that mimics the Hubble flow.",
New submissions,Power-Law Bounces in $f(R)$ Gravity: Analysis of the Ekpyrosis and Accelerating Regimes,"Saurya Das,Peter Dunsby,S. Shajidul Haque,Seturumane Tema",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.",
New submissions,Black Holes Immersed in Galactic Dark Matter Halo,Alexey Dubinsky,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We analyze the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields in the background of a black hole immersed in a galactic dark matter halo. The analytic black hole solution considered here is sourced by a physically motivated halo density profile that leads to a flat galactic rotation curve. Using the sixth-order WKB method with Padé approximants, we compute the QNM spectra for various field spins and parameter values, and provide numerical data in tabulated form. In addition to the numerical analysis, we derive analytic expressions for the quasinormal frequencies in the eikonal limit and beyond, by means of an expansion in inverse powers of the multipole number. We also calculate the Unruh temperature perceived by a static observer in the halo-modified spacetime. Our results demonstrate that the presence of the dark matter halo leads to observable modifications in the QNM spectra only if the density or compactness of the galactic halo is extraordinary high, so that quasinormal ringing a reliable observable for testing the black hole geometry, even in the presence of galactic environments.",
New submissions,Magnification of Classical Multimessenger Signals in Stationary and Axisymmetric Spacetimes with Separable Equations of Motion,Torben C. Frost,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"When photons, gravitational waves, and massive particles such as neutrinos are gravitationally lensed the signals detected by telescopes or detectors on and around Earth are usually either magnified or demagnified. However, for stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes conventional methods for calculating the magnification factor usually only allow to calculate it relative to the spacetime position of the source but not with respect to the source's reference frame. While this may be sufficient when we want to investigate the properties of the lens, when we want to investigate the source and its properties we need to relate the detected signals to the same signals in the reference frame of their source. In this paper we will now show that for stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes which possess a Carter constant, we can use the constants of motion and the tetrad formalism to derive a magnification factor which relates a signal detected in the reference frame of an observer to the same signal in the reference frame of its source.",
New submissions,Tidal Stretching and Compression in Black Bounce Backgrounds,"T. M. Crispim,Marcos V. de S. Silva,G. Alencar,Diego Sáez-Chillón Gómez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Black bounces are compact objects that combine the structures of regular black holes with those of wormholes. These spacetimes exhibit a rich causal structure and can differ fundamentally from usual black holes. In this work, we study the behavior of the tidal forces by considering different black bounce models. To this end, we start with the geodesic deviation equation and the tidal tensor, from which we compute the radial and angular components of the tidal forces. We find that these components are finite throughout the entire spacetime, including at the wormhole throats. Through the components of the displacement vector, we observe that, unlike the Schwarzschild case, a compression effect on bodies may occur in certain regions.",
New submissions,"Stability of Thin Shell and Wormhole Configurations: Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild -- (Anti-) de Sitter, and FLRW Spacetimes","Travis Seth Rippentrop,Avijit Bera,Mustapha Ishak",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The stability of thin shell wormholes and black holes to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations about a static equilibrium is analyzed. Thin shell formalism is explored and junctions formed from combinations of Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild - de Sitter, and Schwarzschild - anti-de Sitter, as well as Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes are considered. The regions of stability for these different combinations are thoroughly described and plotted as a function of mass ratios of the Schwarzschild masses and radii of the wormhole throats. A taxonomy of the qualitative features of the various configurations and parameter spaces is developed, illustrating the stability regions when present. The considered wormholes are all found to be unstable in the causal region.",
New submissions,"Black Holes in Lorentz-Violating Gravity: Thermodynamics, Geometry, and Particle Dynamics","Ankit Anand,Aditya Singh,Anshul Mishra,Saeed Noori Gashti,Takol Tangphati,Phongpichit Channuie",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the thermodynamics, topology, and geometry of black holes in Lorentz-violating gravity. Modifications in the theory by perturbative parameter lead to coupled changes in horizon structure and thermodynamic behaviour, allowing us to derive generalized universal relations and explore implications for the Weak Gravity Conjecture. The thermodynamic topology reveals distinct topological charges, with photon spheres identified as robust topological defects. Our analysis shows that the Ruppeiner curvature remains universally negative across thermodynamic ensembles, indicating dominant attractive interactions among microstructures. This ensemble-independent behaviour highlights a fundamental thermodynamic universality in Lorentz-violating settings. Together, these results provide a consistent and rich framework for understanding black hole microphysics and gravitational consistency in modified theories. We further study the motion of timelike test particles in these black hole spacetimes by analyzing the effective potential shaped by the Lorentz-violating couplings. The resulting dynamics reveal the existence of bound orbits and stable circular trajectories, with the location of the innermost stable circular orbit and turning points significantly influenced by the parameters $\ell_{1,2}$, and the cosmological constant. Numerical simulations of trajectories in the $x-y,\,x-z$, and 3D planes show precessing, bounded, and plunging orbits, depending on the particle's specific energy and angular momentum. These results highlight how Lorentz-violating effects alter the structure of geodesic motion and provide potential observational signatures in the dynamics of massive particles near black holes.",
New submissions,"Uniform rate inflation in $f(T, \mathcal{T})$-gravity","Priyanka Mandal,B. C. Paul",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present uniform rate inflation in a modified $f(T, \mathcal{T}) $ gravity. It is found that early inflation can be realized even with a scalar field field with a quadratic potential and a negative cosmological constant. We construct inflationary model for the inflaton field without slow-roll approximation. The inflaton field rolling at a constant speed permits a universe with sufficient inflation which encompasses the present universe fairly well. The initial value of the scalar satisfies a lower limit which is sufficiently large compared to the field required for chaotic inflation. The Planck prediction for cosmological perturbations are estimated. It is found that the cosmological model is stable.",
New submissions,Buchdahl stars and bounds with cosmological constant,"Christian G. Boehmer,Naresh Dadhich,Surajit Das",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Schwarzschild interior solution, when combined with the assumption of a finite central pressure, leads to the well-known Buchdahl bound. This bound establishes an upper limit on the mass-to-radius ratio of an object, which is equivalent to imposing an upper limit on the gravitational potential. Remarkably, this limit exhibits considerable universality, as it applies to a broader class of solutions beyond the original Schwarzschild interior metric. By reversing this argument, one can define the most compact horizonless object that satisfies this gravitational bound. Intriguingly, the same bound arises when applying the virial theorem to an appropriately chosen combination of gravitational and potential energy. In this work, we explore the generalised Buchdahl compactness bound in the presence of a cosmological constant. We investigate its implications, define a suitable gravitational energy and an associated potential energy that incorporate the cosmological term, and demonstrate that the universality of the Buchdahl bound persists. However, we also observe that different bounds emerge depending on the chosen approach. We discuss these findings in detail and conclude by proposing a new inequality.",
New submissions,Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles II: Sigma Models on Event Horizons,Andrew James Bruce,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Carrollian field theories are usually understood as limits of relativistic theories. In this note, we use Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles equipped with a principal connection to construct Carrollian sigma models intrinsically. The resulting theories are neither ``electric'' nor ``magnetic'' in the usual sense. As a physically suggestive example, we derive a Carrollian wave equation governing the dynamics of a scalar field on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole.",
New submissions,Detection probability of light compact binary mergers in future observing runs of the current ground-based gravitational wave detector network,Om Sharan Salafia,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"With no binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected yet during the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) detector network, despite the time-volume (VT) surveyed with respect to the end of O3 increased by more than a factor of three, a pressing question is how likely the detection of at least one BNS merger is in the remainder of the run. I present here a simple and general method to address such a question, which constitutes the basis for the predictions that have been presented in the LVK Public Alerts User Guide during the hiatus between the O4a and O4b parts of the run. The method, which can be applied to neutron star - black hole (NSBH) mergers as well, is based on simple Poisson statistics and on an estimate of the ratio of the VT span by the future run to that span by previous runs. An attractive advantage of this method is that its predictions are independent from the mass distribution of the merging compact binaries, which is very uncertain at the present moment. The results, not surprisingly, show that the most likely outcome of the final part of O4 is the absence of any BNS merger detection. Still, the probability of a non-zero number of detections is 34-46\%. For NSBH mergers, the probability of at least one additional detection is 64-71\%. The prospects for the next observing run O5 are more promising, with predicted numbers $N_\mathrm{BNS,O5}=28_{-21}^{+44}$, and the NSBH detections to be $N_\mathrm{NSBH,O5}=65_{-38}^{+61}$ (median and 90\% symmetric credible range), based on the current LVK detector target sensitivities for the run. The calculations presented here also lead to an update of the LVK local BNS merger rate density estimate that accounts for the absence of BNS merger detections in O4 so far, that reads $2.8\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}\leq R_0\leq 480\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$.",
New submissions,Muffled Murmurs: Environmental effects in the LISA stochastic signal from stellar-mass black hole binaries,"Ran Chen,Rohit S. Chandramouli,Federico Pozzoli,Riccardo Buscicchio,Enrico Barausse",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The population of unresolved stellar-mass black hole binaries (sBBHs) is expected to produce a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) potentially detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this work, we compute the imprint of astrophysical environmental effect--such as gas dynamical friction and accretion--on this background. Using the sBBHs population constraints obtained by the LIGO--Virgo--Kagra collaboration, we compute the expected SGWB and develop a phenomenological parametric model that can accurately capture the effect of dynamical friction and accretion. Using our model, we perform Bayesian inference on simulated signals to assess the detectability of these environmental effects. We find that even for large injected values of the Eddington ratio, the effect of accretion in the SGWB is undetectable by LISA. However, LISA will be able to constrain the effect of dynamical friction with an upper bound on the gas density of $\rho \lesssim 7.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{g \, cm^{-3}}$, thus probing the sBBH environment forming in typical thin accretion disks around Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). For injected densities of $\rho \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9} \mathrm{g} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, dynamical friction effects can be well measured and clearly distinguished from vacuum, with Bayes factors reaching up to $\sim$ 60, even when the Galactic foreground is included.",
New submissions,Generalised Aichelburg-Sexl and Self-Force for photons,"Abedennour Dib,Aymeric Garnier,Alessandro Spallicci",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We generalise the Aichelburg-Sexl Stress-Energy-Momentum tensor for massless particles to include motion with angular velocity, introducing tensorial spherical harmonics. Further, we make steps towards the concept of self-force for photons which could manifest as frequency shift.",
New submissions,Rotating Black Holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld Theory,"Lang Cheng,Peng Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We numerically construct a family of stationary, axisymmetric black hole solutions in Einstein-Born-Infeld theory, incorporating both electric charge and rotation. Our results indicate that when nonlinear electromagnetic effects are weak, rotating BI black holes with fixed spin approach the extremal limit as the electric charge increases. In contrast, strong nonlinear effects lead to the termination of solutions at configurations corresponding to naked singularities. We demonstrate that nonlinear electrodynamics enhances the gyromagnetic ratio relative to that of Kerr-Newman (KN) black holes. Additionally, we analyze the Innermost Stable Circular Orbits (ISCOs) and find that both prograde and retrograde ISCO radii are consistently smaller than those found in KN black holes.",
New submissions,Gravitational Wave Signatures of Periodic Motion near Higher-Derivative Einstein-Æther Black Holes,"Sayantan Choudhury,Md Khalid Hossain,Gulnur Bauyrzhan,Koblandy Yerzhanov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Higher-derivative modifications of general relativity are generically expected from effective field theory approaches to quantum gravity, and they arise naturally in Lorentz-violating theories such as Einstein-Ether gravity. In this work, we investigate black hole spacetimes within Einstein-Ether theory supplemented by quadratic curvature corrections, including terms proportional to $R^2$, $R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu}$, and $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho} R^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$. We derive the corrected static, spherically symmetric metric perturbatively and examine its effects on the geodesic structure and gravitational wave emission. In particular, we analyze periodic timelike orbits in this background and compute the associated tensor-mode gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole approximation. Our results demonstrate that even small higher-derivative corrections can induce distinguishable shifts in the orbital dynamics and imprint characteristic phase modulations and harmonic deformations in the gravitational wave signal. These effects modify the frequency spectrum and amplitude envelope of $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$ in a manner sensitive to the coupling constants $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$, and the Ether parameter $c_{13}$. The resulting signatures provide a potential observational window into ultraviolet deviations from general relativity and Lorentz symmetry in the strong-field regime.",
New submissions,Khronon-Tensor theory reproducing MOND and the cosmological model,"Luc Blanchet,Constantinos Skordis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We propose an alternative scalar-tensor theory based on the Khronon scalar field labeling a family of space-like three-dimensional hypersurfaces. This theory leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at galactic scales for stationary systems, recovers GR plus a cosmological constant in the strong field regime, and is in agreement with the standard cosmological model and the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies.",
New submissions,Black holes and wormholes in Deser-Woodard gravity,Juliano C. S. Neves,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The Deser-Woodard gravity is a modified theory of gravity in which nonlocality plays a central role. In this context, nonlocality is consequence of the inverse of the d'Alembertian operator $\square^{-1}$ in the effective action. Here, analytic black hole and wormhole solutions are built in the revised Deser-Woodard theory following a recent approach, where a special tetrad frame simplifies the complicated field equations of the theory. From deviations of the Schwarzschild metric and Reissner-Nordström metric, one obtains trasversable wormholes, singular black holes and a regular black hole as solutions of the vacuum field equations of the theory. Also, the auxiliary fields, which are responsible for the nonlocality, are computed. And even for a regular black solution, in which spacetime does not contain a curvature singularity, the corresponding auxiliary fields diverge at the event horizon.",
New submissions,"The $Spin(4)$ gauge theory of space, time, gravitation, matter and dark matter","Tomi Koivisto,Lucy Zheng,Tom Zlosnik",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A novel gauge-theoretic framework for spacetime and gravitation is proposed, in which a {\it Cartan khronon} field dynamically breaks the symmetry between space and time, enabling the emergence of temporality within a fundamentally Euclidean setting. Based on a $Spin(4)$ gauge structure, the theory provides a real-valued formulation of chiral spacetime, wherein the effects typically attributed to dark matter could instead be explained by the dynamics of gravitation. New results are presented with implications for a broad range of phenomena, including cosmology, large-scale structure, gravitational waves, black holes, and potential signatures accessible to laboratory experiments. By avoiding the pitfalls of complexification and reinterpreting chiral spacetime geometry through a real, dynamical, and gauge-theoretic lens, the {\it Cartan khronon} theory offers a fresh and compelling framework for revisiting the foundations of spacetime and gravitation.",
Cross submissions,Cosmological solutions from 4D $N=4$ matter-coupled supergravity,H. L. Dao,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"From four-dimensional $N=4$ matter-coupled gauged supergravity, we study smooth time-dependent cosmological solutions interpolating between a $dS_2\times \Sigma_2$ spacetime, with $\Sigma_2 = S^2$ and $H^2$, in the infinite past and a $dS_4$ spacetime in the infinite future. The solutions were obtained by solving the second-order equations of motion from all the ten gauged theories known to admit $dS_4$ solutions, of which there are two types. Type I $dS$ gauged theories can admit both $dS$ solutions as well as supersymmetric $AdS$ solutions while type II $dS$ gauged theories only admit $dS$ solutions. We also study the extent to which the first-order equations that solve the aforementioned second-order field equations fail to admit the $dS_4$ vacua and their associated cosmological solutions.",
Cross submissions,Symmetry-protected conservation of superhorizon inflationary perturbations to all loops,"Cheng-Jun Fang,Zhen-Hong Lyu,Chao Chen,Zong-Kuan Guo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We demonstrates that the single-field inflation field system exhibits a symmetry that constrains its evolution via the Ward identity even for non-attractor inflation. By analyzing loop diagram structures, we derive a superhorizon conserved quantity directly related to the two-point correlation function of curvature perturbations, generalizing previous one-loop results to arbitrary loop orders. This symmetry-based approach provides a framework for understanding quantum conservation laws beyond the leading perturbative order.",
Cross submissions,Test mass charge management in the detection of gravitational waves in space based on UV micro-LED,"Yuandong Jia,Zhihao Zhang,Yinbowen Zhang,Yuning Gu,Suwen Wang,Guozhi Chai,Zemin Zhang,Yi Zhang,Shanduan Zhang,Hongqing Huo,Zongfeng Li,Pengfei Tian,Yun Kau Lau",Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Optics (physics.optics),"As an alternative to the ultraviolet light emitting diode(UV LED), the feasibility of utilizing UV micro-LED in the charge management in the detection of gravitational waves in space is experimentally studied. Compared with UV LED, micro-LED is more compact in size, has better current spreading, faster response time and longer operating life. Performance characteristics of micro-LEDs were measured, with peak wavelength of 254 nm, 262 nm, 274 nm, and 282 nm for each respective micro-LED, and the photoelectric effect was demonstrated. The effectiveness of micro-LED based charge management experiments were demonstrated using above micro-LEDs mounted on a cubical test mass, and different discharge rates were achieved by varying the drive current and duty cycle using pulse width modulation(PWM). Laboratory data was also shown to demonstrate the space qualification of the micro-LED device, the key electrical and optical characteristics of the micro-LEDs showed less than 5% variation. The results of the qualification bring the micro-LED device Technology Readiness Level(TRL) to TRL-5. TRL-6 will be reached provided additional radiation and thermal tests are conducted and in a position ready to be flown and further tested in space.",
Cross submissions,Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$Λ$CDM parameter with cosmological data,"Oliver H. E. Philcox,Eva Silverstein,Gonzalo Torroba",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.",
Cross submissions,Covariant Lie Derivatives and (Super-)Gravity,Grigorios Giotopoulos,Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The slightly subtle notion of covariant Lie derivatives of \textit{bundle-valued} differential forms is crucial in many applications in physics, notably in the computation of conserved currents in gauge theories, and yet the literature on the topic has remained fragmentary. This note provides a complete and concise mathematical account of covariant Lie derivatives on a spacetime (super-)manifold $M,$ defined via choices of lifts of spacetime vector fields to principal $G$-bundles over it, or equivalently, choices of covariantization correction terms on spacetime. As an application in the context of (super-)gravity, two important examples of covariant Lie derivatives are presented in detail, which have not appeared in unison and direct comparison: $\bf{(i)}$ The natural covariant Lie derivative relating (super-)diffeomorphism invariance to local translational (super-)symmetry, and $\bf{(ii)}$ the Kosmann Lie derivative relevant to the description of isometries of (super-)gravity backgrounds. Finally, we use the latter to rigorously justify the usage of the traditional (non-covariant) Lie derivative on coframes and associated fields in dimensional reduction scenarios along abelian $G$-fibers, an issue which has thus far remained open for topologically non-trivial spacetimes.",
Cross submissions,Double Copy Map for Double Field Theory on an Arbitrary Constant Background,Rasim Yılmaz,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Double field theory (DFT) can be constructed up to third order as the double copy of Yang- Mills theory. In this construction, one starts with Yang-Mills theory on Minkowski space and the resulting DFT action is also defined on Minkowski space. In this work, I extend this double copy procedure to obtain a DFT action on a constant DFT background starting from two Yang-Mills actions constructed around nontrivial background gauge fields on Minkowski space.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational photon echo,"Wen-Te Liao,Sven Ahrens",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"The generation, controls, and storage of the gravitationally induced photon echo using the 8.4 eV Thorium-229 nuclear clock transition on Earth are theoretically investigated. With its exceptionally narrow linewidth of approximately 1 mHz and high quality factor in the order of $10^{19}$, the Thorium-229 clock transition allows for the potential detection of gravitational-redshift effects at millimeter-scale altitude variations. Moreover, the 1740-second half lifetime of the Thorium-229 isomeric state allows for the slow movement of the system within its coherence time. Along this line, we explore the generation, controls, and storage of photon echo arising from a rotation induced inversion of the gravitational frequency shift in a single target or in multiple equally spaced samples. Our approach lays the foundation for the controllable gravitational quantum optics on Earth.",
Cross submissions,Celestial Chiral Algebras and Self-Dual Gravity,Simon Heuveline,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Celestial holography suggests, among other things, that collinear singularities of graviton scattering amplitudes are described by the OPEs of some putative dual CFT. One of the great successes has been the insight that this duality is true at tree-level which led to the discovery of new infinite dimensional symmetry algebras of tree-level amplitudes in flat space closely related to w$_{1+\infty}$. This thesis studies these celestial chiral algebras in the light of twistor theory and derives tree-level deformations thereof induced by non-trivial background geometries that solve some form of the self-dual Einstein equations.",

Utilizing a well-established general parameterization of interacting quark matter, we construct quark star models featuring sharp first-order quark-quark phase transitions of various types, in contrast to the hadron-quark transition in conventional hybrid stars. We systematically investigate how recent observations, such as the pulsar mass measurements $M_{\rm TOV}\gtrsim2M_{\odot}$ and the GW170817's tidal deformability bound $\Lambda_{1.4M_{\odot}}<800$, constrain the viable parameter space. We also identified twin stars in some of the HybQS parameter space. This work unveils new possibilities of phase transitions and the resulting new types of compact stars in realistic astrophysical scenarios.",
Cross submissions,A Non-Inflationary Axion and ALP Misalignment Mechanism,Robert Brandenberger(McGill University),High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Based on considerations of quantum gravity, global symmetries which lead to axions as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons after low scale symmetry breaking cannot be exact at the Planck scale. Here, we show that Planck-suppressed terms which yield this symmetry breaking may provide a non-inflationary misalignment mechanism which can generate coherent oscillations of the axion and axion-like particle (ALP) fields at low temperatures.",
Cross submissions,Burgers equation for the bulk viscous pressure of quark matter,"José Luis Hernandez,Cristina Manuel,Saga Säppi,Laura Tolos",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"The dissipative properties of relativistic strongly interacting nuclear matter significantly influence the damping of stellar oscillations and density fluctuations during compact star mergers. In this work, we derive the evolution equation for the bulk viscous pressure in unpaired quark matter under small deviations from equilibrium. Our analysis reveals that it behaves like a two-component Burgers fluid. We identify four key transport coefficients -- two relaxation times and two bulk viscosity coefficients -- expressed in terms of equilibrium parameters and electroweak nonleptonic and semi-leptonic decay rates. The transport coefficients are evaluated for two distinct equations of state: one based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics and the other on a modified MIT bag model, valid in different density regimes. We also determine the temperature and density region where nonleptonic electroweak processes dominate the dissipation. Our formulation establishes a new way of describing bulk viscous effects in quark matter, applicable for numerical simulations of compact star mergers.",
Cross submissions,Perturbative unitarity bounds on field-space curvature in de Sitter spacetime: purity vs scattering amplitude,"Qianhang Cai,Tomoya Inada,Masataka Ishikawa,Kanji Nishii,Toshifumi Noumi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study perturbative unitarity bounds on the field-space curvature in de Sitter spacetime, using the momentum-space entanglement approach recently proposed by Pueyo, Goodhew, McCulloch, and Pajer. As an illustration, we perform a perturbative computation of the purity in two-scalar models and compare the resulting unitarity bounds with those obtained via a flat space approximation. In particular, we find that perturbative unitarity imposes an upper bound on the field-space curvature of the Hubble scale order, in addition to a bound analogous to the flat space result. This reflects the thermal nature of de Sitter spacetime. We also discuss generalizations to higher-dimensional field spaces.",
Cross submissions,Lecture Notes on Operator Algebras and Quantum Field Theory,Rainer Verch,Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Lecture notes prepared for the EMS--IAMP Spring School ``Symmetries and Measurement in Quantum Field Theory''. This set of lecture notes covers four lectures: 1. Operator Algebras and Quantum Field Theory, 2. Tomita-Takesaki Modular Theory of von Neumann Algebras and the Bisognano-Wichmann/Borchers Theorem, 3. Local Covariant Quantum Field Theory, 4. Temperature and Entropy-Area Relation of Quantum Fields near Horizons of Dynamical Black Holes. The basic aim is to provide an introduction into some of the contemporary concepts and methods of quantum field theory in the operator-algebraic framework (lectures 1 to 3), and to illustrate (in lecture 4) how they may be applied in a theme of both perpetual and current interest - the ``thermodynamics'' (and also, the ``information content'') of quantum matter in the vicinity of black holes. While the topic of ``measurement'' in quantum field theory is not covered in these lectures (this topic has been presented in the lectures of Chris Fewster [arXiv:2504.17437]), the topic of``symmetry'' in quantum field theory does make an appearance: On one hand, in the form of the geometric action of Tomita-Takesai modular objects associated with certain operator algebras and states as stated in the theorems by Bisognano-Wichmann, and by Borchers, and on the other hand, in the form of local general covariance.The Spring School took place at the University of York, UK, April 7-11, 2025, organized by C.J. Fewster, D.W. Janssen and K. Rejzner, and funded by EPSRC Grant EP/Y000099/1 to the University of York, the European Mathematical Society, the International Association of Mathematical Physics, and COST Action (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) CA23115: Relativistic Quantum Information. The material presented in these notes is an expanded version of the material presented during the lectures by the author.",
Cross submissions,Accelerating Universe from Constraints,"Anamaria Hell,Misao Sasaki",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that a single constrained scalar field with non-minimal coupling to gravity can give rise to an accelerating Universe. First, we consider this model in the absence of external matter. In the original Jordan frame, we show that the dynamics of space-time is independent of the value of the cosmological constant. We find analytical solutions, which include evolution from a radiation dominated-like universe to an exponential expansion, as well as evolution that starts with super-Hubble expansion and then relaxes towards an exponential expansion of the Universe. We also show that the scalar perturbations of this theory are well-behaved in the Jordan frame. Furthermore, we perform the formulation of the corresponding theory in the Einstein frame, and analyse the corresponding accelerating solutions. Second, we consider the model in the presence of matter. We find that the matter does not affect the evolution of the universe if minimally coupled to the scalar field. In other words, in the Jordan frame, in order to influence the evolution of the space-time, the matter should be non-minimally coupled to the constrained scalar, while it may be minimally coupled to gravity. We show that in this case, the solutions are similar to the free case, and, in addition, allow for the phantom-like equation of state. Finally, we consider the theory in the minimal frame, in which the matter is minimally coupled to both gravity and the constrained scalar, and show that among other possibilities, the phantom-like equation of state can still be satisfied in this minimal frame.",
Cross submissions,Finite-cutoff Holographic Thermodynamics,"Ming Zhang,Wen-Di Tan,Mengqi Lu,Dyuman Bhattacharya,Jiayue Yang,Robert B. Mann",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a framework for holographic thermodynamics in finite-cutoff holography, extending the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence to incorporate a finite radial cutoff in the bulk and a $T^2$-deformed CFT on the boundary. We formulate the first laws of thermodynamics for a Schwarzschild-AdS (SAdS) black hole with a Dirichlet cutoff on the quasilocal boundary and its dual deformed CFT, introducing the deformation parameter as a thermodynamic variable. The holographic Euler relation for the deformed CFT and its equation of state are derived, alongside the Smarr relation for the bulk. We show that the Rupert teardrop coexistence curve defines a phase space island where deformation flow alters states, with up to three deformed CFTs or cut-off SAdS sharing a same phase transition temperature, one matching the seed CFT or original SAdS. These results offer insights into gravitational thermodynamics with boundary constraints and quantum gravity in finite spacetime regions.",
