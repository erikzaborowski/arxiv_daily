New submissions,Degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories in metric-affine gravity,Hamed Bouzari Nezhad,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We construct the metric-affine analogue of the quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. We begin with a general metric-affine scalar-tensor action that is linear in curvature and contains all operators that are at most quadratic in the covariant second derivatives of the scalar field, ensuring that the connection enters only through curvature and through these second derivatives. Solving the connection equation by performing a full decomposition of the distortion tensor gives a closed-form effective metric theory. Imposing the standard metric DHOST degeneracy conditions then selects a Palatini Class Ia branch that is fully determined by two free functions in the original action. Analyzing the tensor sector shows that requiring gravitational waves to propagate at the speed of light further restricts the theory to a one-function family. These results provide a detailed and self-contained characterization of the quadratic metric-affine Class Ia sector within this operator basis and identify the theoretical conditions implied by gravitational wave observations.",
New submissions,About possible measures in Quantum Gravity,O. P. Santillán,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Possible measures for Quantum Gravity are considered. Choices that are invariant under diffeomorphisms are analyzed, but the possibility of employing non invariant measures is also taken into account. The last possibility may be accepted if the anomaly in the measure is compensated by counter term redefinitions of the model under analysis. Particular attention is paid to some concrete examples of non covariant looking measures, which may be useful for generalizing the Veltmann identities when quantizing around curved space times. The results are specified for the Stelle gravity model [1]-[2], which is known to be renormalizable in flat space, although not known to be so in curved ones.",
New submissions,Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Massive Black Hole Formation,"Bernard J. Kelly,Sarah Gossan,Leonardo R. Werneck,John Wise,Zachariah B. Etienne,Thiago Assumpção,Aláine Lee,John G. Baker",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) are an important component of the massive black hole population of the early universe, and their formation and early mergers will be prominent in the data stream of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). However, the population and binary properties of these early black holes are poorly understood, with masses, mass ratios, spins, and orbital eccentricities strongly dependent on the details of their formation, and the properties of the remaining exterior material (baryonic and non-baryonic), which may be substantial to the point of merger.We report on initial work to simulate the formation, collapse, and/or merger of such DCBH regions in order to extract the resulting gravitational-wave signals.",
New submissions,Massless Majorana spinors in the Kerr spacetime,"Tianyuan Cai,Xiao Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In this paper, we show that massive Majorana spinors \eqref{1.2} do not exist if they are $t$-dependent or $\phi$-dependent in Kerr, or Kerr-(A)dS spacetimes. For massless Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime, the Dirac equation can be separated into radial and angular equations, parameterized by two complex constants $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$. If at least one of $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$ is zero, massless Majorana spinors can be solved explicitly. If $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$ are nonzero, we prove the nonexistence of massless time-periodic Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime which are $L^p$ outside the event horizon for $ 0<p\le\frac{6}{|\epsilon_1|+|\epsilon_2| +2}$. We then provide the Hamiltonian formulation for massless Majorana spinors and prove that the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian leads to the angular momentum $a=0$ and spacetime reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime, moreover, the massless Majorana spinor must be $\phi$-independent. Finally, we show that, in the Schwarzschild spacetime, for initial data with $L^2$ decay at infinity, the probability of the massless Majorana spinors to be in any compact region of space tends to zero as time tends to infinity.",
New submissions,Gravitational lensing in a warm plasma,"Barbora Bezděková,Volker Perlick",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Analytical studies of light bending in a dispersive medium near compact objects, e.g., black holes or neutron stars, are most challenged by a suitable definition of the medium. The most realistic model would be a hot magnetized plasma. In such a medium, however, an analytical description of light rays is very difficult. Therefore, usually an isotropic dispersive medium is assumed in analytical calculations. While it is possible to formulate equations for a general refractive index, which some studies do, most attention in the literature is given to the particular case of a cold, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma. Whereas this model covers many astrophysically relevant situations, there are indications that in some cases the plasma temperature is so high that the approximation of a cold plasma is no longer valid. For this reason, we consider in this paper a warm, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma, where the temperature is not set equal to zero but assumed to be small enough, such that relevant equations can be linearized with respect to it. After discussing the general equations for light rays in such a medium on a general-relativistic spacetime, we specify to the axially symmetric and stationary case which includes the spherically symmetric and static case. In particular, we calculate the influence of a warm plasma on the bending angle. In the spherically symmetric and static case, we also calculate the shadow in a warm plasma. We illustrate the general results with a static (respectively corotating) and an infalling warm plasma on Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes.",
New submissions,Warm Inflation in a Braneworld Scenario,"Sabina Yeasmin,Atri Deshamukhya",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In the literature, many warm inflationary models are formulated. In this piece of work, a warm inflationary model in the braneworld scenario is studied, considering constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Performance of the model has been considered in both strong and weak dissipative regimes. We study the dynamics of this scenario under slow-roll approximation and estimate cosmological observables, viz., the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. In order to constrain the parameters in our model, we consider data from Planck 2018 and BICEP.",
New submissions,Dual Effective Field Theory formulation of Metric--Affine and Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity,Ginés R. Pérez Teruel,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a unified algebraic and effective field theory (EFT) formulation for non--Riemannian extensions of General Relativity with an independent connection. For metric--affine $f(R,Q)$ gravity we show that the connection equations admit an exact matrix solution, whose square--root structure generates a convergent binomial/Neumann expansion in powers of the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. For the Eddington--inspired Born--Infeld (EiBI) theory we show that the connection can be solved algebraically as well, and that its determinantal field equations produce a parallel Neumann expansion with coefficients fixed by the underlying determinant operator. This allows us to rewrite the Einstein--like equations in the auxiliary metric as an effective Einstein equation for $g_{\mu\nu}$ with a local algebraic correction $(\Delta T)_{\mu\nu}$ that follows from a dual EFT built from the invariants $\{T,\,T^2,\,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu},\ldots\}$, organised by a characteristic density scale. We prove a convergence criterion based on the spectral radius of $\hat T^\mu{}_\nu$ and interpret EiBI gravity as a determinantal resummation of the same $T$--tower. Extending the framework to symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, we identify the EFT coefficients in terms of $f_Q$ and $f_{QQ}$ and present a background matching for $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q^2$. The resulting dual EFT provides a common algebraic language for metric--affine, Born--Infeld and non--metricity gravities.",
New submissions,Improving the inference of the stellar quantities using the extended $I$-Love-$Q$-$δM$ relations,"Eneko Aranguren,José A. Font,Nicolas Sanchis-Gual,Raül Vera",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"In relativistic Astrophysics the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations refer to approximately EoS-independent relations involving the moment of inertia, Love number, and quadrupole moment through some quantities that are normalised by the mass $M_0$ of the background configuration of the perturbative scheme. Since $M_0$ is not an observable quantity, this normalisation hinders the direct applicability of the relations. A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $\chi_S<0.1$). The more accurate alternative approach, based on the $I$-Love-$Q$-$\delta M$ set of relations, circumvents this limitation by enabling the inference of $M_0$. Here we review both approaches and provide numerical comparisons.",
New submissions,Relativistic accretion process onto rotating black holes in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamic gravity,"Orhan Donmez,G. Mustafa,Himanshu Chaudhary,M. Yousaf,Abdelmalek Bouzenada,Allah Ditta,Farruh Atamurotov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this study, we uncover the accretion dynamics and oscillatory behavior around rotating black holes within the EEH nonlinear electrodynamic framework by analyzing both the motion of test particles and numerically solving the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.",
New submissions,Static Charged Polytropic Spheres with a Cosmological Constant: Physical Acceptability and Trapped Orbits,"Alex Stornelli,Anish Agashe",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider static charged fluid spheres with a cosmological constant. We assume a polytropic equation of state, $p \propto \rho^\Gamma$, and a power law charge distribution, $q\propto r^n$. Using this, we convert the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation into a differential equation for the mass profile. By solving this equation numerically, we analyse both physical and geometric properties of these charged fluid spheres for different values of $n$ and $\Gamma$. By imposing subluminal sound speeds and energy conditions, we restrict ourselves to configurations that are physically acceptable. Then, within these physical models, we study internal trapping of circular geodesics and find the trapping regions in the $n$-$\Gamma$ parameter space. Going beyond the traditionally studied case of null geodesics, we consider orbits of charged and/or massive particles. We show that for neutral null particles (and only for them), their trapping depends purely on the properties of the space-time. In the other three cases, properties such as the particle's own charge and/or energy also play a role. In general, we find that trapping of all types of particles is allowed for a broad range of $n$ and $\Gamma$.",
New submissions,Light trajectories and optical appearances in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild and black string space-times,"G. Alencar,Arthur Lima,Diego Rubiera-Garcia,Diego Sáez-Chillón Gómez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) imaging of the central objects in the M87 and Milky Way galaxies provide compelling evidence that these objects are consistent with (Kerr) black holes. In view of these observations and the future expectations of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) on which the EHT observations are based, an intensive research work has been carried out in the literature to simulating light trajectories and reconstructing the corresponding optical appearance for a wide array of modified black holes and ultra-compact objects. The corresponding images are directly affected not only by the background space-time geometry but also by the physics of the accretion disk, whose combination yields a characteristic fingerprint. In this paper, we consider such a fingerprint for objects which are not asymptotically flat but instead approach a Anti-de Sitter space-time. This assumption significantly influences light trajectories and, consequently, the corresponding images of the objects as seen by an observer at some distance, which can be used in future VLBI observations for testing alternatives of this kind to the Kerr paradigm. We illustrate our considerations with the examples of a Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole and a black string, discussing their most notable departures from canonical, asymptotically-flat black hole space-times.",
Cross submissions,From Asymptotically Flat Gravity to Finite Causal Diamonds,"Luca Ciambelli,Temple He,Kathryn M. Zurek",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We demonstrate that the phase space of the soft sector of asymptotically flat gravity in four spacetime dimensions can be identified with that of a spherically symmetric finite casual diamond in Minkowski spacetime. The leading soft graviton mode is identified with the radial fluctuation of the causal diamond size, while the Goldstone mode involves both the radial fluctuation and its symplectic partner. This allows us to relate the radial fluctuations of the causal diamond with the asymptotic transverse fluctuations parametrized by the soft modes.",
Cross submissions,Notes On de-Sitter Mellin Barnes Amplitudes,Sayantan Choudhury,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this paper, we create a Mellin space method for boundary correlation functions in de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. We demonstrate that the analytic continuation between AdS${}_{d+1}$ and dS${}_{d+1}$ is encoded in a set of simple relative phases using the Mellin-Barnes representation of correlators. It helps us to determine the scalar three-point and four-point functions and their corresponding Mellin-Barnes amplitudes in dS${}_{d+1}$ space using the known results from AdS${}_{d+1}$ space. The Mellin-Barnes representation reveals the analytic structure of boundary correlation functions over all $d$ and scaling dimensions. In the present discussion, the {\it split representation} have been used as an instrumental technique in particularly the evaluation of bulk Witten diagrams and is suitable to obtain the {\it Conformal Partial Wave decomposition} of tree-level exchange in the bulk Witten diagrams. The equivalent adjustment to the cosmological three-point and four-point function of generic external scalars may be further extracted from these results, assuming the weak breakdown of the de Sitter isometries. These findings offer a step towards a more methodical comprehension of de Sitter observables utilising Mellin space techniques at the tree level and beyond.",
Cross submissions,Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations,Sridhar Tayur,Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We examine a mechanism of spontaneous decoherence in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ of a positive Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta} = e^{i\beta \log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates showing that oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $O(1/|\beta|)$. The Born rule and the Hilbert-space inner product remain unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical.The physical motivation for the deformation arises from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical quantum-gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. Examples including FRW minisuperspace, quartic potentials, curved-background Hamiltonians, and a Schwarzschild interior-type model illustrate how the mechanism yields explicit decoherence rates. The parameter $\beta$ may be experimentally constrained through precision coherence measurements in low-noise quantum platforms. The mechanism contrasts with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Diosi-Penrose gravitational collapse, and real-order fractional dynamics in that it acts purely through deterministic spectral phases of a single Hamiltonian. The analysis positions the framework as a compact and testable phenomenological representation of logarithmic spectral corrections appearing in quantum-gravity-motivated effective theories.",
Cross submissions,Harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate,"Zehua Tian,Weiping Yao,Xiaobao Liu,Mengjie Wang,Jieci Wang,Jiliang Jing",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We theoretically propose an experimentally viable scheme to explore the transfer of nonclassical correlations from a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to a pair of impurities immersed in it. Operating at ultra-low temperature, density fluctuations of the dipolar BEC emulate a vacuum field with Lorentz-violating dispersion, while the two impurities function as Unruh-DeWitt detectors for the BEC quasiparticles. We study the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum of this analogue Lorentz-violating quantum field by spatially separated Unruh-DeWitt detectors. Our analysis reveals key parameter dependencies that optimize the harvesting of entanglement. In particular, unlike the Lorentz-invariant case, smoother detector switchings does not enhance the entanglement harvesting efficiency from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum. Moreover, the strength of the Lorentz-invariant violation can shift the optimal energy structure of the detectors for harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum-a clear deviation from the Lorentz-invariant scenario. As a fundamental quantum mechanical setup, our quantum fluid platform provides an experimentally realizable testbed for examining the entanglement harvesting protocol from an effective Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum using a pair of impurity probers, which may also has potential implications for exploring the Lorentz-invariant violation in quantum field theory.",
Cross submissions,Bimetric MOND as a framework for variable-$G$ theories -- local systems and cosmology,Mordehai Milgrom,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Bimetric MOND (BIMOND) is used as a platform for variable-$G$ theories that have MOND-specific idiosyncrasies. E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\approx 2\pi G$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\approx 2\pi\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e> G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era.",
Cross submissions,Island of acoustic black hole in Schwarzschild spacetime,"Yu-Ye Cheng,Jia-Rui Sun",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study an analogue information paradox in acoustic black holes which are emerged from the superfluid surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole. The resulting acoustic black hole contains both acoustic horizons and optical horizon, with analogue Hawking radiation, i.e. phonons, emitted from the outer acoustic horizon. By using the island formula, we calculate the entanglement entropy of analogue Hawking radiation of the acoustic black hole in both non-extremal and extremal cases. In the non-extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons follow the Page curve due to the emergence of islands, and it is approximately proportional to the area of the acoustic horizon at late time. While in the extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons diverges, leading to an ill-defined Page time. Our study verifies the unitarity of the analogue gravity system, and provides further insight into the connection between the entanglement entropy and the causal structure of spacetime.",
Cross submissions,Constraints on Spatial Curvature and Dark Energy Dynamics in the $w$CDM Model from DESI DR1 and DR2,"Manish Yadav,Archana Dixit,M. S. Barak,Anirudh Pradhan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we investigate the $w$CDM dynamical dark energy model with spatial curvature utilizing the recently released DESI Collaboration data (DR1 and DR2) in conjunction with other observational probes such as BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (PP). Our investigation attempts to discover which DESI dataset gives a better match to the $w$CDM framework and assess the impact of spatial curvature on cosmological constraints. We find that the cosmic curvature parameter, $\Omega_k$, disfavors the cosmological constant for the DR2+BBN and DR2+BBN+OHD data combinations. However, the deviation from the cosmological constant remains below the $1\sigma$ level, indicating a mild preference for a open universe. In contrast, when using the DR1 based combinations namely DR1+BBN and DR1+BBN+OHD-the deviation from the cosmological constant increases to approximately $1.2\sigma$, suggesting a slightly stronger indication of a open geometry. Also, the best-fit values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) obtained from the DR1+BBN+OHD+PP and DR2+BBN+OHD+PP combinations within the dynamical dark energy model are consistent with the results reported by the Planck Collaboration. Our findings provide constraints on the dark energy EoS parameter $ w_{\mathrm{}0}$, reveal a mild but notable deviation from the vacuum energy ($w = -1$) scenario at a significance level $1.8\sigma$ from DR2+BBN+OHD+PP and $0.5\sigma$ from DR1+BBN+OHD+PP, both favoring the quintessence region of dark energy. Furthermore, the key physical distance measures $D_H$, $D_V$, and $D_M$ show better consistency with our model when analyzed with the DR2 data.",
Cross submissions,The impact of AGN environmental effects on testing general relativity with space-borne gravitational wave detector,"Xiangyu Lyu,Hongyu Chen,En-Kun Li,Yi-Ming Hu",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as TianQin offers a new window to test General Relativity by observing the early inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes. A key concern arises if these stellar-mass binary black holes reside in gaseous environments such as active galactic nucleus accretion disks, where environmental effects imprint detectable modulations on the gravita- tional waveform. Using Bayesian inference on simulated signals containing both environmental and dipole deviation, we have assessed the extent to which the presence of environmental effects affects the detectability of dipole radiation. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter can be recovered with high precision, and the evidence for dipole radiation remains distinguishable. Crucially, we find that the existence of environmental effects does not fundamentally impede the identification of dipole radiation, provided both effects are simultaneously modelled in the inference process. This study establishes that future tests of modified gravity with space-borne observatories can remain robust even for sources in astrophysical environments.",
Cross submissions,Correlations of Simulated Black-Hole Movies Reveal Extreme-Lensing Signatures,"Barbora Bezděková,Shahar Hadar,George Wong,Maciek Wielgus",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A black hole's gravitational pull can deflect light rays to an arbitrary degree. As a result, any source fluctuation near the black hole creates multiple lagged images on an observer's screen. For optically thin stochastic emission, these light echoes give rise to correlations of brightness fluctuations across time-dependent images (movies). The correlation pattern disentangles source-specific characteristics from universal features dictated by general relativity. This picture has motivated a proposal to use the two-point image correlation function as a probe of extreme gravitational lensing in upcoming black-hole imaging campaigns. In this work, we test the feasibility of this method by computing the two-point correlation function of brightness fluctuations in a black-hole movie of state-of-the-art realism. The movie is generated by ray tracing a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, which can then be blurred to any angular resolution. At an effective resolution expected to be achieved by next-generation terrestrial very-long-baseline interferometric arrays, the lensing signatures appear in neither time-averaged images nor light-curve autocorrelations. However, we demonstrate that they are clearly visible in the more fine-grained two-point image correlation function. Our positive findings motivate a more comprehensive investigation into the instrument specifications and inference techniques needed to resolve extreme lensing effects through correlations.",
Cross submissions,Euclid preparation. Review of forecast constraints on dark energy and modified gravity,Euclid Collaboration,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Euclid mission has been designed to provide, as one of its main deliverables, information on the nature of the gravitational interaction, which determines the expansion of the Universe and the formation of structures. Thus, Euclid has the potential to test deviations from general relativity that will allow us to shed light on long-lasting problems in the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Euclid will mainly do this by using two complementary probes: weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. In this paper we review pre-launch Euclid analyses for dark energy and modified gravity. These include forecast constraints with future Euclid data on cosmological parameters for different cosmological models, such as a time-varying dark energy component, phenomenological modifications of the perturbation sector and specific modified gravity models, with further extensions that include neutrino physics and the coupling to the electromagnetic sector through the fine-structure constant. We review the study of the impact of nonlinear clustering methods on beyond-$\Lambda$CDM constraints with Euclid. This is of fundamental importance to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos, given that we will have access to a wealth of information on scales beyond the linear regime. We inspect the extension of theoretical predictions for observable quantities in alternative cosmologies to $\Lambda$CDM at fully nonlinear scales by means of $N$-body simulations. We discuss the impact of relativistic corrections in extended cosmological models. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of the Euclid mission to tightly constrain parameters of dark energy and modified gravity models, or perhaps to detect possible signatures of a $\Lambda$CDM failure.",
Cross submissions,Adding electromagnetic birefringence to pulsar timing and astrometry to detect gravitational waves,"Keisuke Inomata,Marc Kamionkowski",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"It was recently shown that the time variation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves from pulsars can be used, in cross-correlation with pulsar timing, to probe the chirality of an isotropic gravitational wave background. Here, we show that the expression for the cross-correlation is derived efficiently with the total-angular-momentum formalism and use this framework to extend the formulation to cross-correlation with astrometry. We do so for spin-1 gravitational waves (that may arise in alternative-gravity theories) as well as the general-relativistic spin-2 gravitational waves.",
Cross submissions,Beyond Two Parameters: Revisiting Dark Energy with the Latest Cosmic Probes,"Hanyu Cheng,Supriya Pan,Eleonora Di Valentino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Dark energy (DE) models with many free parameters are often considered excessive, as constraining all parameters poses a significant challenge. On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w_0$), its initial value ($w_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w_m$ to $w_0$ occurs ($a_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($\Delta_{\rm de}$). We constrain the model using CMB data from Planck, BAO from DESI DR2, and three distinct compilations of Type Ia Supernovae: PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3. Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w_0 > -1$), while $w_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times. Interestingly, despite its larger parameter space, the proposed DDE model is preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, based on both $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence, for certain combined datasets, particularly CMB+BAO+DESY5 and CMB+BAO+Union3.",

We describe the main developments introduced relative to the original implementation and outline the optimized parameter-space selection used in the search. We then compute the theoretical sensitivity of the method and compare it with an empirical sensitivity estimate obtained by injecting simulated signals into LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a data. The updated framework achieves improved sensitivity and computational performance. These results provide a robust basis for future directed searches for long-transient gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae and other transient events in current and upcoming observing runs.",
Cross submissions,Black Hole Thermodynamics without Black Hole Solutions,"Meng-Nan Yang,Guan-Yi Lu,H. Lu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider the string-theory inspired Einstein-Maxwell-Maxwell-dilaton theory (EMMD) and show that we can derive the complete set of thermodynamic quantities of charged black holes, without having to solve for the black hole solutions. We argue that the technique can be applied more broadly to string theories, providing an accessible method for determining the thermodynamic properties of large classes of black holes for which exact solutions are typically unavailable.",
