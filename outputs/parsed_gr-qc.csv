New submissions,Constraining the Cosmological Evolution of Post-Newtonian Parameters with Gravitational Wave Signals from Compact Binary Inspirals,"Oliver Pitt,Timothy Clifton",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals offer a new opportunity to constrain the cosmological time dependence of gravitational coupling parameters, due to the high precision of the observations themselves as well as the significant cosmological redshifts at which such systems exist. We calculate theory-independent equations of motion for compact objects in a binary system, implementing a new approach to sensitivities, and subsequently determine the gravitational wave signal that one should expect to measure from their inspiral. Expressions for the wave phase and amplitude are derived in terms of post-Newtonian gravitational coupling parameters, radiative flux parameters, and compact body sensitivities. These results complement recent attempts to gain theory-independent constraints on the time-evolution of gravitational coupling parameters from cosmological probes, and represent a new opportunity to constrain modified gravity with gravitational wave data.",
New submissions,Noncommutative Bianchi I and III Cosmology Models: Radiation Era Dynamics and gamma Estimation,"G. Oliveira-Neto,Y. Soncco Apaza",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Understanding the early evolution of the universe requires models that incorporate possible quantum and anisotropic effects in its dynamics. In this work, we analyze the dynamical evolution of locally rotationally symmetric anisotropic cosmological models of Bianchi type I (flat curvature) and Bianchi type III (open curvature) within a noncommutative phase space framework characterized by a deformation parameter gamma. Using a Hamiltonian formulation based on Schutz formalism for a perfect radiation fluid, we introduce noncommutative Poisson brackets that allow for geometric corrections to commutative dynamics. The resulting equations are solved numerically under various initial conditions, enabling the study of the impact of gamma and the energy density C on the universe expansion and anisotropy evolution. The results show that gamma < 0 enhances expansion and favors isotropization, while gamma > 0 tends to slow expansion and preserve residual anisotropy, especially in the open curvature model. It is estimated that the influence of non-commutativity was significant during the early stages of the universe, decreasing toward the present time, suggesting that this approach could serve as an effective alternative to the cosmological constant in describing the evolution of the early universe.",
New submissions,Distinguishing between Black Holes and Neutron Stars within a Population of Weak Tidal Measurements,"Michael MÃ¼ller,Reed Essick",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We study the ability of tidal signatures within the inspiral of compact binaries observed through gravitational waves (GWs) to distinguish between neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). After quantifying how hard this measurement is on a single-event basis, we investigate the ability of a large catalog of GW detections to constrain the fraction of NS in the population as a function of mass: $f_{\mathrm{NS}}(m)$. Using simulated catalogs with realistic measurement uncertainty, we find that $> O(200)$ events will be needed before we can precisely measure $f_{\mathrm{NS}}$, and catalogs of $> O(100)$ events will be needed before we can even rule out the possibility that all low-mass objects are BHs with GW data alone (i.e., without electromagnetic counterparts). Therefore, this is unlikely to occur with advanced detectors, even at design sensitivity. Nevertheless, it could be feasible with next-generation facilities like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope.",
New submissions,Chaos of charged particles near a renormalized group improved Kerr black hole in an external magnetic field,"Junjie Lu,Xin Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD),"In a quantum theory of gravity, a renormalization group improved Kerr metric is obtained from the Kerr metric, where the Newton gravitational constant is modified as a function of the radial distance. The motion of neutral test particles in this metric is integrable. However, the dynamics of charged test particles is nonintegrable when an external asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field exists in the vicinity of the black hole. The transition from regular dynamics to chaotic dynamics is numerically traced as one or two dynamical parameters vary. From a statistical point of view, the strength of chaos is typically enhanced as both the particle energy and the magnetic field increase, but it is weakened with increasing the particle angular momentum and the black hole spin. In particular, an increase of the quantum corrected parameter weakens the extent of chaos. This is because the running Newton gravity constant effectively weakens the central gravitational attraction and results in decreasing sensitivity to initial conditions.",
New submissions,Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves: universal characteristics of strongly lensed memory waveforms,"Ruanjing Zhang,Zhi-Chao Zhao,Shaoqi Hou,Xi-Long Fan,Kai Liao,Zong-Hong Zhu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, the strong lensing effect of the memory signal was considered. In the geometric optics limit, the lensed memory signal becomes oscillatory, while the unlensed is basically monotonic. This is because only the high frequency Fourier modes contribute to the lensed signal. Therefore, the strong lensing system serves as a high-pass filter for the memory signal. Due to the step function like behavior of the unlensed memory waveform, the lensed waveform possesses characteristic morphology that is dependent on the type of the image, and independent of the lens model and the binary system. That is, for each type of the lensed image, the lensed memory waveform has an approxmiate reflection symmetry about a symmetrical axis in the time domain. More specifically, for the type I and type III images, the lensed memory signals are nearly odd under the reflection, while the type II signal is roughly even. In addition, at the symmetrical axis, the sign of the slope for type I image is different from that for the type III image. These universal characteristic features would help determine the type of the lensed image. This is particularly because the memory waveform can be well approximated by a suitable step function, which involves two parameters. In addition, the detection of multiple images by the space-borne interferometer would also be helpful. Once the type of the lensed image is determined with the approximated memory waveform, one can use the appropriate waveform template for the oscillatory component of the gravitational wave to perform the parameter estimation.",
New submissions,Particle creation in a cosmological background in analogy to the Schwinger effect,"Walter D. van Suijlekom,Michael F. Wondrak,Heino Falcke",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We consider a gravitational analogue of the Schwinger effect in a cosmological context. While the Schwinger effect is usually attributed to a static electric background, its derivation is actually based on a switching on/off of the electric field in the infinite past/future. Motivated by this, and our previous work on particle production in a gravitational background, we consider a long pulse of the gravitational field in an FLRW-spacetime, thus simulating a static background. We rigorously derive particle production by a novel application of the Heun equation. In fact, the recently obtained connecting formulas between its local solutions can be used to determine the Bogolyubov coefficients, and subsequently the particle production probabilities, in the limit of an infinitely long pulse.The particle production in the FLRW-model is found to have a lower threshold on the outgoing frequencies, which can be related to the duration of the time interval of the switching on/off the background field. For large frequencies and in the spatially flat case, we find black-body radiation whose temperature is inversely proportional to the radius of the apparent horizon that appears in the FLRW-model during the phase of scale change.We compare our findings to Schwinger's result on particle production for a long pulse of an electromagnetic background field, for which we also include a detailed derivation.",
New submissions,A physically interesting singularity in general relativity,Bob Holdom,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore what appears to be a very benign timelike and naked singularity of the Weyl curvature scalar. This singularity arises in an inhomogeneous generalization of the Einstein static universe. The matter energy density is everywhere finite and it vanishes at the singularity. The spacetime still enjoys causal geodesic completeness and unambiguous wave dynamics. Each singularity contributes to the Komar mass of the spacetime, and this reduces the required size of the positive cosmological constant. In an expanding universe, the effect of the singularities is to push the acceleration towards more positive values.",
New submissions,Theoretical filters for shift-symmetric Horndeski gravities,"Athanasios Bakopoulos,Christos Charmousis,Nikos Chatzifotis,Theodoros Nakas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the structure of nontrivial maximally symmetric vacua and compact-object solutions in shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories. Focusing on Horndeski gravity, we derive consistency conditions directly from the field equations to identify the subclasses that admit Minkowski and de Sitter vacua with a nontrivial scalar field. In doing so, we obtain a filtering mechanism that operates independently of observational data. In this context, we introduce the notion of stealth vacua, where the scalar field remains active without altering the vacuum. Following this, we examine the theoretical framework of Horndeski theories that admit homogeneous geometries and we extract the implicit form of the solution pertaining to the entire family of theories. Building upon these frameworks, we construct exact solutions in beyond-Horndeski gravity by applying a linear disformal transformation to the regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole. This procedure yields solitonic spacetimes with scalar hair as well as black holes carrying primary scalar hair, demonstrating how disformal maps can qualitatively modify solution properties. We delineate the parameter space in which the transformation is well-defined and analyze the solutions. Our results provide both a principled criterion for selecting viable Horndeski models and a framework for exploring rich solution spaces in beyond-Horndeski gravity.",
New submissions,Particles with precessing spin in Kerr spacetime: analytic solutions for eccentric orbits and homoclinic motion near the equatorial plane,Gabriel Andres Piovano,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a family of analytic solutions for the nearly-equatorial motion of a test particle with precessing spin in Kerr spacetime. We solve the equations of motion up to linear order in the small body's spin for periodic and homoclinic orbits. At zero order, the particle moves along equatorial geodesics. The spin-curvature force introduces post-geodesic corrections which, for generic spin orientations, cause the precession of the orbital plane. We derive the solutions for eccentric orbits in terms of Legendre elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions for generic referential geodesics (known as ``spin gauges""). Our analytical solutions perfectly match the numerical trajectories obtained by Drummond and Hughes in Phys. Rev. D 105, 124041 (2022), and Piovano et al. in Phys. Rev. D 111, 044009 (2025). Furthermore, we present, for the first time, the solutions for homoclinic orbits for a spinning particle in Kerr spacetime, and the spin-corrections to the location of the separatrix. The homoclinic trajectories are described in closed form using elementary functions. Finally, we introduce a novel parametrization for the motion of a spinning particle, called ``fixed eccentricity spin gauge"". The latter is the only spin gauge in which the corrections to periodic orbits are finite at the geodesic separatrix, and continuously reduce to the last stable orbits under appropriate limits. Our results will be useful for modeling the inspiral and transition-to-plunge phases of asymmetric mass binaries within the two-time-scale framework.",
Cross submissions,Regular black holes in isothermal cavity,Athanasios G. Tzikas,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We examine the thermodynamic behavior of a static neutral regular (non-singular) black hole enclosed in a finite isothermal cavity. The cavity enclosure helps us investigate black hole systems in a canonical or a grand canonical ensemble. Here we demonstrate the derivation of the reduced action for the general metric of a regular black hole in a cavity by considering a canonical ensemble. The new expression of the action contains quantum corrections at short distances and concludes to the action of a singular black hole in a cavity at large distances. We apply this formalism to the noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole, in order to study the phase structure of the system. We conclude to a possible small/large stable regular black hole transition inside the cavity that exists neither at the system of a classical Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity, nor at the asymptotically flat regular black hole without the cavity. This phase transition seems to be similar with the liquid/gas transition of a Van der Waals gas.",
Cross submissions,Targeted search for an individual SMBHB in NANOGrav 15-year and EPTA DR2 data sets,"Li-Wen Tian,Yan-Chen Bi,Yu-Mei Wu,Qing-Guo Huang",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"While pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), the detection of continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from a confirmed supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) would provide strong support for the SMBHB origin of GWB. In this study, we analyze continuous GWs from the SMBHB candidate 3C 66B, modeling the GWB as a common uncorrelated red noise. Using Bayesian methods, we perform targeted searches across two PTA data sets: Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves 15 years data set and the European Pulsar Timing Array DR2 full data set. We find no evidence of such signal in both data sets and then place upper limits on the amplitude of the signal and the chirp mass of the source. Additionally, we evaluate the case of a GWB characterized by Hellings-Downs correlations using a likelihood reweighting method, which consistently reconfirms the conclusion of non-detection.",
Cross submissions,Hydrodynamic models of Reheating,"Juan Pablo ElÃ­a,Lucas Cantarutti,Nahuel MirÃ³n-Granese,Esteban Calzetta",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a causal hydrodynamic model that provides an effective macroscopic description of the field-theoretic dynamics during the early stages of reheating. The inflaton condensate is treated as a homogeneous background coupled to a relativistic fluid that represents its inhomogeneous fluctuations. Within the divergence-type theory framework derived from kinetic considerations, the model captures essential dissipative and non-equilibrium effects while remaining stable and causal. We find that the coupling between the oscillating condensate and the fluid induces a parametric resonance in the tensor sector, leading to the amplification of the viscous stress tensor and the generation of gravitational waves with a characteristic spectral peak. The predicted spectrum agrees with lattice simulations performed with CosmoLattice. This hydrodynamic approach offers an effective bridge between microscopic field dynamics and macroscopic cosmological observables.",
Cross submissions,Non-closed scalar charge in 4-dimensional Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet black hole thermodynamics,"Romina Ballesteros,Marcela CÃ¡rdenas,Eric Lescano",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a covariant differential-form framework to define scalar charges for stationary, asymptotically flat black holes in $4$--dimensional Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a general scalar coupling function. Contracting the scalar field equation of motion with the horizon generator $k$ yields a non-closed-form scalar charge, revealing a bulk contribution encoded in a $3$--form, which measures the obstruction to its closedness. In the presence of shift-symmetry, this obstruction vanishes and the $2$--form scalar charge satisfies a Gauss law, depending solely on boundary data. Geometrically, this reproduces known topological results in the shift-symmetric limit. This framework allows us to analyze the role of the non-closed scalar charges in black hole thermodynamics through the Smarr formula for more general couplings and provide a covariant, charge-based interpretation of the spontaneous scalarization mechanism, showing how the behavior of the scalar charge and the bulk term capture the instability of scalar-free black holes and the emergence of scalar hair. Our results offer a unified geometric understanding of the role of scalar charges and the mechanism of spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.",
Cross submissions,Low-Frequency Gravitational Waves in Three-Dimensional Core-Collapse Supernova Models,"Colter J. Richardson,Anthony Mezzacappa,Kya Schluterman,Haakon Andresen,Eric J. Lentz,Pedro Marronetti,Daniel Murphy,Michele Zanolin",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We discuss the low-frequency gravitational wave signals from three state-of-the-art three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models produced with the \textsc{Chimera} supernova code. We provide a detailed derivation of the gravitational wave signal sourced from the anisotropic emission of neutrinos and provide the total (fluid sourced and neutrino sourced) gravitational waves signal generated in our models. We discuss the templatablity of this low-frequency signal, which is useful for future work involving matched filtering for signal detection and parameter estimation.",
Cross submissions,Broken Weyl Gravity: Dynamical Torsion and Generalized Proca,"Lucas FernÃ¡ndez Sarmiento,Irvin MartÃ­nez RodrÃ­guez",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a symmetry-based construction of gravity from a phase in which Weyl invariance is spontaneously broken. Using the coset formalism, the dilaton acts as a Stuckelberg field for the gauged scale symmetry, giving the Weyl gauge field a mass of order $\mathcal{O}(M_{\rm Pl})$. The resulting gauge-gravity interactions fall within the ghost-free generalized Proca framework. We further show that the Weyl field can be exchanged for a propagating vector component of torsion, providing a natural realization of dynamical vector torsion. Our construction organizes all operators systematically, clarifies the absence of Wess-Zumino terms in $d=4$, and recovers General Relativity in the infrared with controlled higher-derivative corrections.",
Cross submissions,LIV-Decoherence on Gravitational Cat States,"Iarley P. Lobo,Kelvin Sampaio,Gislaine VarÃ£o,Moises Rojas,Valdir B. Bezerra",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inspired by approaches based on the stochastic generalized uncertainty principle, we propose a Lindblad equation derived from the quantization of a stochastic modified dispersion relation in a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) scenario. This framework enables us to investigate decoherence effects in a system of particles exhibiting gravitationally induced entanglement. We analyze the impact of LIV on entanglement (quantified by concurrence) considering systematic and stochastic effects.",
Cross submissions,Investigating the $w$CDM Model with Latest DESI BAO Observations,"Manisg Yadav,Archana Dixit,M. S. Barak,Anirudh Pradhan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we explore the impact of various combinations of CMB-independent datasets, including the recent DESI BAO measurements, on the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy and other cosmological parameters within the framework of the dynamical dark energy model ($w$CDM). Assuming a constant EoS parameter for dark energy, we derive constraints on the free parameters of the model using observational datasets such as DESI BAO, BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (SN$^+$) $\&$ SH0ES. Our analysis examines the deviations of the $w$CDM model from the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and assesses its implications for cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ tension [$\text{km} \text{s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$]. We find that the combination of DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ \&SH0ES) datasets provides constraints on $w_{\mathrm{de}0}$, suggesting a possible deviation from the cosmological constant scenario at a significance level of $1.6\sigma$ ($1.4\sigma$), respectively. Furthermore, we observe an inverse correlation between $w_{\text{de0}}$ and $H_0$, which highlights the role of dark energy dynamics in resolving the tension $H_0$ by approximately $2.1\sigma(0.8\sigma)$ from DESI BAO + BBN + OHD (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ \&SH0ES) datasets, respectively.Our findings offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy and its influence on the cosmic expansion history, with implications for future observational efforts. We utilize the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to evaluate our model's performance. The results indicate that the $w$CDM model demonstrates superior effectiveness.",
Cross submissions,Hubble Constant and Mass Determination of Centaurus A and M83 from TGRB Distances,"Adrian Faucher,David Benisty,David F. Mota",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"An independent determination of the Hubble constant is crucial in light of the persistent tension between early- and late-Universe measurements. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 galaxies, along with their associated dwarf companions identified via Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance measurements, to constrain both the group mass and the local value of $H_0$. By examining the motions of these galaxies relative to the system's barycenter, we apply both the minor and major infall models, which provide bounds on the true radial velocity dispersion. Averaging these approaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(11 \pm 2) \times 10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass, we derive a corresponding value of the Hubble constant as $68 \pm 5~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent, dynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly accounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We also discuss the mild tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass estimates, which likely arises from the fact that M83 is close to the velocity surface and breaks the Hubble flow model assumptions. While the Hubble flow fit emphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the velocity-distance relation, the virial estimate includes the broader spread of bound galaxies near the group core, which seems to fit better for the CenA/M83 total mass.",
Cross submissions,All toric Hermitian ALE gravitational instantons,"Bernardo Araneda,James Lucietti",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We prove that the only smooth, Ricci flat, ALE instanton with a toric Hermitian non-KÃ¤hler structure is the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. The proof is analogous to the classification of toric Hermitian ALF instantons by Biquard and Gauduchon, although we avoid the use of toric KÃ¤hler geometry and instead perform a direct global analysis of the Tod form of the metric in Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates. This supports a conjecture by Gibbons and Bando-Kasue-Nakajima which states that any Ricci flat ALE instanton is self-dual.",
Cross submissions,Effect of stochastic kicks on primordial black hole abundance and mass via the compaction function,"Sami Raatikainen,Syksy Rasanen,Eemeli Tomberg",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study stochastic effects in viable ultra-slow-roll inflation models that produce primordial black holes. We consider asteroid, solar, and supermassive black hole seed masses. In each case, we simulate $10^8$ patches of the universe that may collapse into PBHs. In every patch, we follow $4\times10^4$ momentum shells to construct its spherically symmetric profile from first principles, without introducing a window function. We include the effects of critical collapse and the radiation era transfer function. The resulting compaction function profiles are very spiky due to stochastic kicks. This can enhance the PBH abundance by up to 36 orders of magnitude, depending on the mass range and collapse criterion. The PBH mass function shifts to higher masses and widens significantly. These changes may have a large effect on observational constraints of PBHs and make it possible to generate PBHs with a smaller amplitude of the power spectrum. However, convergence issues for the mass function remain. The results call for redoing collapse simulations to determine the collapse criterion for spiky profiles.",
Cross submissions,Dark matter production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes,Ngo Phuc Duc Loc,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study dark matter (DM) production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes (RPBHs). While there are many available metrics that describe singularity-free RPBHs, we focus on the Hayward metric and the Simpson-Visser metric for illustrative purpose. The framework can be applied straightforwardly to other metrics. RPBHs generally have different Hawking temperature and therefore different lifetime from the standard singular black holes. The resulting modified cosmological constraints for this DM production mechanism and the allowed parameter space to obtain the correct DM abundance are calculated.",
Cross submissions,Generalized Distributions of Host Dispersion Measures in the Fast Radio Burst Cosmology,"Jing-Yi Jia,Da-Chun Qiang,Lin-Yu Li,Hao Wei",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"As is well known, Hubble tension is one of the most serious challenges in cosmology to date. So, it is of interest to measure the Hubble constant by using some new probes independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa). One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts (FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology proposed by Macquart {\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution functions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant $H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current ${\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\rm IGM}$ fairly close to its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for the parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a small $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a loose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125 localized FRBs. We show that the model with loose $F$ prior is strongly preferred over the one with narrow $F$ prior in all terms of the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC. So, the great Hubble tension between FRBs, Planck 2018 and SH0ES should be taken seriously. Instead of modifying $\sigma_\Delta=Fz^{-0.5}$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$, here we try to find a new way out by generalizing the distribution of $\rm DM_{host}$ with varying location and scale parameters $\ell$ and $e^\mu$, respectively. We find that $H_0$ can be consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES in all cases. All the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC for the generalized distributions of $\rm DM_{host}$ are overwhelmingly strong.",
Cross submissions,Yukawa interactions in Quantum Gravity,"Gustavo P. de Brito,Manuel Reichert,Marc Schiffer",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present the first complete next-to-leading-order analysis of a Yukawa system within the framework of asymptotically safe quantum gravity. Our results are obtained through a systematic resummation of higher-order operators, revealing two distinct resummation mechanisms -- one of which has not been explored previously. In addition, we introduce a novel approach to estimate systematic uncertainties by simulating the impact of neglected higher-order contributions.We demonstrate that quantum gravity fluctuations anti-screen Yukawa interactions, thereby resolving previously inconclusive leading-order results. This anti-screening mechanism enables the generation of finite interactions from an asymptotically free Yukawa fixed point. Consequently, our findings provide strong evidence that non-vanishing Yukawa couplings are compatible with asymptotically safe quantum gravity, which is a necessary requirement for the Standard Model to emerge from an asymptotically safe ultraviolet completion.",
Cross submissions,Anchoring the Universe with Characteristic Redshifts using Raychaudhuri Equation Informed Reconstruction Algorithm (REIRA),"Shibendu Gupta Choudhury,Purba Mukherjee,Anjan Ananda Sen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the robustness and physical implications of a set of characteristic redshifts that capture key features of the late-time Universe. Using both model-independent reconstructions as well as different dark energy (DE) parameterizations, we show that these redshifts remain stable across cosmological models and reconstruction algorithm, making them reliable geometric anchors of the expansion history. Moreover, the Alcock-PaczyÅski corrections at these redshift anchors are found to be unity with high statistical significance, making them natural isotropy points in the comoving distance-redshift relation. We also find that certain redshifts anchors $(z < 1)$ coincide with epochs where strong deviations from the Planck $\Lambda$CDM baseline are apparent irrespective of DE parametrisation like CPL or reconstruction algorithm, indicating their potential as probes of new physics in cosmological evolution. Finally, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a Raychaudhuri Equation Informed Reconstruction Algorithm, substantially enhances the precision of the inferred distance measures and the Hubble expansion rate as well as results tighter constraints in the DE parameter space. These results demonstrate that combining geometric reconstruction with physics-informed kinematic information offers a powerful and consistent algorithm to probe new physics in the late-time dynamics of our Universe.",
