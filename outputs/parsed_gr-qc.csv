New submissions,"Phase space analysis of cosmological models on $f(R,G,T)$ gravity","Elangbam Chingkheinganba Meetei,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the present article, we developed a dynamical system in the context of modified $f(R,G,T)$ gravity, where $R$, $G$ and $T$ are Ricci scalar, Gauss-Bonnet term and energy-momentum tensor respectively. Development of the dynamical system is done by first defining 9 dimensionless variables and formulate a ordinary differential equations by taking derivative of the variables with respect to logarithmic time $N=\log a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor. This formulation is applied to the model $f(R,G,T)=\alpha R^{l}+\beta G^{m} + \gamma T^{n} $, and its solutions and their corresponding stabilities are analysed in details. From the plot of density parameters vs $N=-log(1+z)$, we conclude that our Universe is currently dominated by dark energy, which is compatible with current observation. Taking $l=2$, cosmic parameters such as deceleration parameter $(q)$, equation of state $(\omega)$ and state finder parameters are also discussed by fixing one dimensionless variable, showing our Universe's expansion is accelerating with the present value of $q=-0.5$. Present value of $\omega=-0.66$ suggests that our Universe is in Quintessence phase. Lastly, the validity of the model with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model is checked by using 77 Hubble, 15 BAO and 1024 pantheon datasets, which implies that our model is aligned with the $\Lambda$CDM model's bahaviour.",
New submissions,Correspondence between particle creation and dark components interaction in the context of $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity,"S. Ganjizadeh,Alireza Amani,M. A. Ramzanpour",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we explore the particle creation scenario in the context of $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity in flat-FLRW metric. For this purpose, from the perspective of thermodynamics and considering an adiabatic universe, we obtain the modified continuity equation in terms of the dynamic number of particles $N$. On the other hand, we obtain Friedmann's equations in $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity and then write down the continuity equations of the components of matter and dark energy, taking into account the interaction between them. In what follows, by establishing a correspondence between the particle production scenario and $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity, we obtain the cosmological parameters in terms of $N$. After that, we find cosmological solutions using power-law cosmology and compare them with Hubble parameter data. Finally, we fit the current model with Hubble data and plot the best fit in terms of the redshift parameter.",
New submissions,On the Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction,"Mark P. Hertzberg,Daniel Jiménez-Aguilar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.",
New submissions,Probing the existence of a minimal length through compact binary inspiral,"N. V. Krishnendu,Aldo Perri,Sumanta Chakraborty,Alessandro Pesci",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Existence of a minimal length in spacetime geometries avoids several singular situations involving quantum theory and gravity. In this work, we show that the existence of such a minimal length also affects the gravitational wave (GW) waveform of any inspiraling binary black hole (BH) system by introducing a minimum frequency, below which the BHs behave as perfectly reflecting compact objects, while above they are identical to classical BHs. This leads to a significant imprint on the tidal heating term, appearing in the GW waveform at 2.5 post Newtonian order. Based on these modifications to the inspiraling waveform, it turns out that the detection of highly spinning and highly absorbing, almost classical BH like compact objects, inspiraling around each other, would be in tension with the quantum properties of BH geometries. The same would also be true if the zero point length exceeds the Planck length by a significant amount, suggesting that the zero point length, if it exists, must be of the same order as the Planck length, or smaller, purely from GW observations.",
New submissions,Signatures of Correlation of Spacetime Fluctuations in Laser Interferometers,"B. Sharmila,Sander M. Vermeulen,Animesh Datta",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Spacetime fluctuations (SFs), a common feature of different proposed gravity models, could be detected using laser interferometers. In the search for SFs, a correspondence between the expected output signals and different gravity models is needed, both for guiding the design of future interferometers, and for identifying the signal in experimental data. In this work, we provide such a correspondence for some classes of SFs and geometries of the interferometers. We consider three different classes of SFs, characterised by the decay behaviours and symmetries of their two-point correlation functions. Our approach applies to Michelson laser interferometers with Fabry-Pérot arm cavities such as the km-long LIGO detectors and those without arm cavities such as the laboratory-scale setups QUEST and GQuEST. Analysing the expected interferometer output signals, we identify three characteristic signatures for each class of SF. The designed broadband sensitivity of the laboratory-scale instruments would allow all characteristic signatures of the different classes of SFs to be observed, and such observations could provide more information on the nature of the SFs than those from LIGO. On the other hand, we find that LIGO is better suited for detecting the bare presence or absence of SFs.",
New submissions,Bounds on the minimum orbital periods of non-singular Hayward and Bardeen black holes,"Guohua Liu,Yan Peng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Based on previous studies, universal bounds $4\pi M \leqslant T_{min} \leqslant 6\sqrt{3}\pi M$ were conjectured to be characteristic properties of black hole spacetimes, where $M$ represents the mass of black holes and $T_{min}$ is the minimum orbital periods around black holes. In this work, we explore the minimum orbital periods of objects around Hayward and Bardeen black holes without central singularities. By combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that both Hayward and Bardeen black holes conform to these bounds. Our results imply that such bounds may be connected to the presence of the black hole horizon rather than the singularity.",
New submissions,Taub-NUT-like Black Holes in Einstein-Bumblebee Gravity,"Yu-Qi Chen,Hai-Shan Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider Einstein-Bumblebee gravity and construct a novel Taub-NUT-like black hole solution within this theory. Different from the Taub-NUT black hole in Einstein gravity (which is Ricci-flat), our newly constructed Taub-NUT-like black hole is not Ricci-flat. Armed with the Wald formalism, we extensively study the thermodynamics of this black hole solution and confirm that both the first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr relation hold. We then take a further step by adding a cosmological constant to the Einstein-Bumblebee theory, and successfully construct a Taub-NUT-AdS-like black hole. We derive all the thermodynamic quantities, including treating the cosmological constant as a pressure, and confirm that the first law and Smarr relation hold as well.",
New submissions,Shadows of naked singularity in Brans-Dicke gravity,"Prajwal Hassan Puttasiddappa,Davi C Rodrigues,David F Mota",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the observational features of exact vacuum solutions in Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, focusing on their implications for black hole shadow imaging. Motivated by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations, we revisit a class of BD solutions that exhibit a naked singularity. These solutions, despite lacking a conventional event horizon, exhibit photon spheres and produce shadow-like features. We analyze null geodesics and perform ray-tracing simulations under a simplified, optically thin accretion disk model to generate synthetic images. Our results show that BD naked singularities can cast shadows smaller than those of Schwarzschild black holes of equivalent mass. We identify the parameter space $-3/2 < \omega < 0$ as physically viable, ensuring attractive gravity and the absence of ghost fields. These findings suggest that BD naked singularities are possible candidates for compact astrophysical objects.",
New submissions,Quantum circuit simulation of black hole evaporation and Maxwell demon interpretation,"H. Hadi,Amin Rezaei Akbarieh,Emmanuel N. Saridakis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We suggest a quantum circuit model which simulates the black-hole evaporation process. In particular, Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully (AMPS) paradox and the ER=EPR correspondence are reconsidered regarding our proposed model, which assumes a Maxwell's demon operating within a black hole interior. In other words, we form a quantum circuit, mimicking the behavior of the entanglement structure of the near-horizon region and the early Hawking radiation located far from the black hole. Furthermore, we indicate how the demon, by applying nonlocal correlations, can mediate via Einstein-Rosen bridges for the purpose of simulating the transfer of quantum information across the horizon without violating the monogamy of entanglement. Finally, the thermodynamic cost of the demon's operations regarding Landauer's principle is analyzed. This indicates that the information erasure has an energy comparable to the black hole entropy.",
New submissions,Black hole/de Sitter as the fastest transmitter/receiver,"Rong-Gen Cai,Li Hu,Shao-Jiang Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent progress on the black hole information paradox has reproduced the Page curve as required by the unitary evolution of the black hole entanglement entropy. In this Letter, we will argue that, the quantum speed limit on how fast a quantum system can evolve unitarily, when saturating the maximal information transmission bounds (Pendry's bound and Bremermann-Bekenstein bound), will slow down the would-be divergent rate of dynamical black hole entropy decreasing at the very end of the Hawking evaporation, during which the Penrose inequality from cosmic censorship conjecture is exactly saturated. Therefore, an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole is the fastest transmitter of information in nature. Further applying the Bremermann-Bekenstein bound on the de Sitter entanglement entropy exactly reproduces the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture, indicating that the would-be-ended inflating de Sitter space is the fastest receiver of information in nature.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics of four-dimensional regular black holes with an infinite tower of regularized curvature corrections,"Adolfo Cisterna,Mokhtar Hassaine,Ulises Hernandez-Vera",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the thermodynamics of a class of four-dimensional black hole solutions arising from the compactification of a higher-curvature gravity theory featuring an infinite tower of Lovelock-type invariants. For planar horizons, we identify two distinct branches: a regular black hole supported by a nontrivial scalar field and a non-regular general relativity (GR) solution with a trivial scalar profile. Despite their differing geometries, both branches share the same free energy at fixed temperature, revealing a thermodynamic degeneracy naturally linked to the enhanced symmetry and scale invariance of the planar base manifold. In the case of a spherical horizon, even if the scalarized branch is not obtained in closed form, one can see that the degeneracy persists in the absence of the quadratic curvature contribution. On the other hand, if this quadratic term is taken into account, the regular solution may be thermodynamically favored (or not) over the Schwarzschild-AdS solution depending on the values of the coupling constants of the theory.",
New submissions,"Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R, T)$ Gravity","Uttaran Ghosh,Sarbari Guha",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In this paper, we examine the structure scalars formed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor of the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in $f(R,T)$ gravity, and how they influence the various physical parameters of the collapsing matter. A treatment is provided for the unspecified $f(R, T)$ function, and the nature of the results for a linear $f(R, T)$ function is presented. In the absence of dissipation, the energy density inhomogeneity is influenced by $X_{TF}$ and the mass function. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure scalars and the total mass-energy content. The dependence of various physical parameters, such as heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar, effective homogeneous energy density, and pressure anisotropy, on the structure scalars has been clearly indicated.",
New submissions,Boundary terms in cosmology,"Ángel Cuevas,Javier Chagoya,C. Ortiz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In the derivation of the Einstein field equations via Hamilton's principle, the inclusion of a boundary term is essential to render the variational problem well-posed, as it addresses variations that do not vanish at the boundary of the spacetime manifold. Typically, this term is chosen as the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. In this work, we propose an alternative treatment of the boundary term within a cosmological framework by employing the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach enforces the vanishing of the boundary term throughout the evolution of the Universe, leading to the prediction of a fluid component that decays as the sixth power of the scale factor. This type of fluid has been studied in the context of the early universe under the name of stiff matter, and it can be related to a scalar field known as kination.",
New submissions,Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories,"Mark P. Hertzberg,Oleksandr S. Stashko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.",
Cross submissions,The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Gravitational Atoms,"Zhaofeng Kang,Tianjun Li,Weitao Ye",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a scenario of primordial gravitational atoms (PGAs), which may exist in the current and past universe due to spinning primordial black holes (PBHs) and very light bosonic fields. In a monochromatic mass scenario with a sizable dimensionless spin, which may arise in a short matter dominated (MD) era, we analyze the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal. Its spectrum is approximately characterized by a rising $\propto f^3$ followed by a falling $\propto f^{-1}$ where $f$ is the frequency. Then, we investigate the constraints and prospects of such a SGWB, and find that PGAs with a core mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim {\cal O}(10)~M_{\odot}$ and a cloud of light scalar with mass $\mu \sim {\cal O} (10^{-13})$ eV could yield constraints even stronger than those from bare PBHs. Future detectors such as LISA, Taiji and TianQin are able to explore PGAs over a narrow and elongated strap in the $(\mu,M_{\rm BH})$ plane, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude for the maximum spin, $10^{-8}~M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\rm BH}\lesssim 10^4~M_{\odot}$, $10^{-16}~{\rm eV}\lesssim \mu\lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm eV$. If the PGA is dressed with a vector cloud, the SGWB signal has a much better opportunity to be probed.",
Cross submissions,"Black hole thermodynamics at 4 derivatives, natural variables and BPS limits","Kiril Hristov,Peng-Ju Hu,Yi Pang",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study Einstein-Maxwell theory in $D \geq 3$ spacetime dimensions including all Lorentz-invariant parity-even four-derivative couplings. Building on the results ofarXiv:2312.11610, we consider static, charged, asymptotically flat black hole solutions to first order in the higher-derivative expansion. In $D=4$ and $D=5$, we compute the corrected black hole thermodynamics and compare with the Reall-Santos prescription based on the two-derivative background, highlighting a subtlety when both inner and outer horizons are involved. By introducing natural variables, as inarXiv:2304.07320, we recast the on-shell actions in terms of left- and right-moving chemical potentials, which significantly simplifies the analysis.We also compute first-order thermodynamic corrections for the most general rotating black holes in $D=4$ and $D=5$, without modifying the background solutions. We identify a novel BPS-like limit in $D=4$, extending known supergravity results beyond their traditional domain of validity. Finally, in $D=5$, the analysis of BPS and almost BPS limits enables an independent verification of the five-dimensional BPS thermodynamics. We clarify the origin of a discrepancy in the literature concerning higher-derivative supergravity localization, sharpening the tension between direct computations and predictions based on the $D=4$/$D=5$ connection.",
Cross submissions,Lorentz Violation with Gravitational Waves: Constraints from NANOGrav and IPTA Data,"Alireza Allahyari,Mohammadreza Davari,David F. Mota",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore a theoretical framework in which Lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken by incorporating derivative terms of the extrinsic curvature into the gravitational action. These modifications introduce a scale-dependent damping effect in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs), governed by a characteristic energy scale denoted as $M_{LV}$ . We derive the modified spectral energy density of GWs within this model and confront it with recent observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). Our analysis yields a lower bound on the Lorentz-violating energy scale, finding $M_{LV} > 10^{-19}$ GeV at 68\% confidence level. This result significantly improves upon previous constraints derived from LIGO/VIRGO binary merger observations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to probe fundamental symmetries of spacetime and offer new insights into possible extensions of general relativity.",
Cross submissions,The Phase Space of Low-Mass Binary Compact Objects from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Catalog: Hints on the Chances of Different Formation Scenarios,"Samsuzzaman Afroz,Suvodip Mukherjee",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational wave (GW) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of binary compact object (BCO) formation, yet directly linking these observations to specific formation scenarios remains challenging. The BCO phase space provides a robust and data-driven approach to discover the likely formation scenarios of these binaries. In this study, we expand the previously introduced binary black hole phase-space technique to encompass low-mass compact objects (LMCOs), establishing a novel framework to investigate their diverse formation mechanisms. Applying this approach to selected low-mass events $(\lesssim 5 M_\odot)$ from the GWTC-3 catalog and the recently observed GW230529 event, we show for the first time the phase-space demonstration of the LMCOs and find the associated probabilities for different formation scenarios including neutron stars, astrophysical black holes, or primordial black holes. Our analysis includes the astrophysical modelling uncertainties in and how it causes degeneracy between different formation scenarios. In future, with improvements in GW detector sensitivity and with detection of more GW events, the LMCO phase-space framework will significantly strengthen our capacity to associate more likely formation scenarios over the other, thereby refining our understanding of compact object formation for both astrophysical and primordial scenarios, and its evolution across the cosmic redshift.",
Cross submissions,An Accurate Modeling of Nano-Hertz Gravitational Wave Signal from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes: Essential Step Towards a Robust Discovery,"Mohit Raj Sah,Akash Maurya,Suvodip Mukherjee,Prayush Kumar,Vida Saeedzadeh,Arif Babul,Chandra Kant Mishra,Kaushik Paul,Thomas R. Quinn,Michael Tremmel",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz (nHz) regime, detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offers a promising avenue to probe the cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). These SMBHBs are expected to retain substantial eccentricity throughout their evolution due to their formation history. In this study, we propose a new modeling scenario of the nHz SGWB by incorporating the eccentricity of SMBHBs into a multi-scale adaptive simulation-based framework. We employ a time-domain eccentric waveform model, \esigmahm{}, to generate realistic gravitational wave (GW) signals from an astrophysical population of SMBHB, including physical effects from sub-parsec scales to Gpc scales. The eccentric inspiraling binary, unlike circular binaries, emits GW signal in multiple frequencies. As a consequence, the SGWB energy density in each frequency bin is not independent; instead, the presence of eccentricity introduces a spectral correlation between different frequencies. We show that these spectral correlations are absent for circular binaries but become increasingly significant for populations with higher eccentricities. Our novel approach can capture this effect and opens up the window towards measuring this with a high signal-to-noise ratio with future observations. This work develops the frontier of nHz signal modeling using eccentricity at small scales and can model realistic nHz signal, which will be essential for robust inference from future observations to shed light on the astrophysical properties of SMBHBs.",
Cross submissions,Can we live in a baby universe formed by a delayed first-order phase transition?,"Qing-Hong Cao,Masanori Tanaka,Jun-Chen Wang,Ke-Pan Xie,Jing-Jun Zhang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We examine the idea that our universe began as a baby universe and show that this is feasible in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model with the classically conformal principle. The framework is consistent with current cosmological data and predicts a heavy neutral gauge boson, which could be detected at colliders.",
Cross submissions,On the spectra of holographic QFTs on constant curvature manifolds,"Ahmad Ghodsi,Elias Kiritsis,Parisa Mashayekhi,Francesco Nitti",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze linear fluctuations of five-dimensional Einstein-Dilaton theories dual to holographic quantum field theories defined on four-dimensional de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter space-times. We identify the physical propagating scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. For these, we write the linearized bulk field equations as eigenvalue equations. In the dual QFT, the eigenstates correspond to towers of spin-0 and spin-2 particles propagating on $(A)dS_4$ associated to gauge-invariant composite states. Using particular care in treating special ``zero-modes,'' we show in general that, for negative curvature, the particle spectra are always discrete, whereas for positive curvature they always have a continuous component starting at $m^2 = (9/4)\alpha^{-2}$, where $\alpha$ is the $(A)dS_4$ radius. We numerically compute the spectra in a concrete model characterized by a polynomial dilaton bulk potential admitting holographic RG-flow solutions with a UV and IR fixed points. In this case, we find no discrete spectrum and no perturbative instabilities.",
Cross submissions,Causality Constraints on Black Hole Thermodynamics in Nonlinear Electrodynamics,"Yoshihiko Abe,Maxime Médevielle,Toshifumi Noumi,Kaho Yoshimura",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study causality constraints on black hole thermodynamics in nonlinear electrodynamics, where the Lagrangian is taken to be an arbitrary function of the electromagnetic field strength tensor. By requiring the absence of superluminal propagation, we show that the mass-to-charge ratio of extremal black holes exhibits a certain monotonicity previously studied in the context of the weak gravity conjecture. Furthermore, under the same condition, we demonstrate that the entropy-to-mass-squared ratio of black holes, which we interpret as an entropy density, decreases monotonically with increasing mass, while keeping the mass-to-charge ratio fixed. This new monotonicity property extends previous studies on the positivity of four-derivative corrections to black hole entropy in the microcanonical ensemble to all orders in nonlinear electrodynamics.",
Cross submissions,Constraining primordial curvature perturbations with present and future GW detectors,Mauro Pieroni,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Primordial scalar curvature perturbations ($\zeta$), typically probed on large cosmological scales via CMB and LSS observations, can be significantly enhanced on smaller scales by various early Universe mechanisms, for instance, non-minimal inflationary models. While decoupled at linear order, scalar and tensor perturbations, i.e., Gravitational Waves (GWs), interact at second order. As a consequence, an enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum $P_\zeta(k)$ can source a sizable stochastic GW background (SGWB). In these proceedings, we briefly review the generation mechanism of such signals, typically referred to as scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs), and discuss the prospects of measuring them with present and future Pulsar Timing Arrays datasets and future GW observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA.",
Cross submissions,The Multiverse: a Philosophical Introduction,Jeremy Butterfield,History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"This book is a philosopher's introduction to the idea that our universe is just one of many universes. I present and assess three versions of the idea: one version from philosophy, and two from physics. In short, they are: all the logically possible worlds; all the branches of the quantum state, in an Everettian interpretation of quantum theory; and all the bubbles of inflationary cosmology. For each proposal, I choose one main philosophical question to discuss in depth. They are, respectively: what is a possible world; what is chance; and what is explanation. But before treating these proposals and their associated questions, I set the stage by reviewing physics and philosophy from about 1600 to about 1900; and a final Chapter compares and contrasts the proposals.",
Cross submissions,Measurements $\mathit{with}$ probabilities in the final state proposal,Ahmed Almheiri,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),Bousso and Stanford (BS) argued that the black hole final state proposal leads to acausal effects and ill-defined probabilities for the AMPS experiment. We identify a loophole in their analysis using insights from entanglement wedge reconstruction and replica wormholes. We trace the cause of the BS problems to the misidentification of the physical interior where the second AMPS measurement happens from among the multiple interiors introduced by the first measurement.,
