New submissions,Self-gravitating nonlinear Dirac fields,"Huan Zhang,Jingsong He",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider the self-gravitating Dirac field with a scalar fermion self-interaction term. For strong enough attractive fermion self-interaction, the maximum Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass of soliton solutions consisting of two fermions can exceed the limit of noninteracting Dirac stars classically, and the ""particle-like"" solutions of the system can exhibit multiplicity, multiple valid solutions for a single set of parameters, that is inherent in the nonlinear Dirac field. We also find the mass-scale separation in our system similar to that discussed in the Einstein-Dirac-Higgs system. Interestingly, the system admits parity-violated solutions. The broken parity symmetry can be restored by increasing the central redshift of the solution.",
New submissions,Acceleration Radiation from Derivative-Coupled Atoms Falling in Modified Gravity Black Holes,"Reggie C. Pantig,Ali Övgün",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The interaction of quantum detector models with fields in curved spacetimes provides fundamental insights into phenomena such as Hawking and Unruh radiation. While standard models typically assume a minimal coupling between the detector and the field, physically motivated derivative couplings, which are sensitive to field gradients, have been less explored, particularly in the context of modified gravity theories. In this paper, we develop a general framework to analyze the acceleration radiation from a two-level atomic detector with a derivative coupling undergoing a radial geodesic infall into a generic static, spherically symmetric black hole. We derive a general integral expression for the excitation probability and apply it to two distinct spacetimes. For an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) black hole, we demonstrate that the detector radiates with a perfect thermal spectrum at the precise Hawking temperature, reinforcing the universality of this phenomenon. For a black hole solution in a Ricci-coupled Bumblebee gravity model, the radiation is also thermal. Still, its temperature is modified in direct correspondence with the theory's Lorentz-violating parameters, consistent with the modified Hawking temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that derivative coupling results in a significantly enhanced entropy flux compared to minimal coupling models. Our results establish acceleration radiation as a sensitive probe of near-horizon physics and demonstrate that this phenomenon can provide distinct observational signatures to test General Relativity (GR) and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime.",
New submissions,A New Paradigm for Testing Gravity: Theory-Independent Constraints Using Data From All Astrophysical and Cosmological Scales,"Daniel B Thomas,Theodore Anton,Timothy Clifton",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Testing General Relativity (GR) is a key science goal of much of modern physics, and usually results in constraints that are either theory or context specific. We present an holistic framework that we dub `Parametrized Post-Newtonian Cosmology' (PPNC), which can be used for obtaining theory-agnostic constraints on deviations from GR using a single unified set of parameters that apply on all astrophysical and cosmological scales. Our approach is based on the formalism and philosophy of the highly successful Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework, but allows us to combine observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) with Solar System observations of the Cassini probe and ephemeris of Mars. The full combination of these data sets constrains average deviations from GR over the history of the Universe to be less than $\sim 10\%$, with PPNC parameter values $\bar{\alpha}=0.97^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and $\bar{\gamma}=0.97^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ at the $68\%$ confidence level (GR corresponds to $\bar{\alpha}=\bar{\gamma}=1$). We find that these gravitational parameters have a strong mutual degeneracy, and are constrained to be within $1\%$ of each other for all of cosmic history. Our results demonstrate the ability of the PPNC framework to combine astrophysical, Solar System and cosmological tests of gravity into a single set of unified constraints. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for upcoming missions in both cosmology and astrophysics, which ultimately seek to constrain the same underlying gravitational interaction.",
New submissions,Perturbations of Solitonic Boson Stars: Nonlinear Radial Stability and Binding Energy,Gareth Arturo Marks,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the nonlinear radial stability of boson stars with a solitonic potential across the entire parameter space, focusing especially on families of solutions that support ultracompact models on the perturbatively stable branch. Using a dimensional reduction of the CCZ4 formulation of numerical relativity, we dynamically evolve these models with both internal and external perturbations. We find in particular that there are perturbatively stable models with positive binding energy that do not effectively disperse even under explicit perturbations, challenging the conventional wisdom that negative binding energy is a necessary condition for the dynamical stability of boson stars and other compact objects.",
New submissions,Spacetime Perspective of Gravitational Lensing in Perturbed Cosmologies,"Thomas P. Kling,Sophia MacQueen Pooler",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We develop the spacetime approach to gravitational lensing by spherically symmetric perturbations of flat, cosmological constant-dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker metrics. The geodesics of the spacetime are expressed as integral expressions which are used to examine the formation of multiple images and the observed shapes of non-point sources. We develop the lens mapping from the spacetime perspective, and use the Jacobian of the mapping to explain the observed image shapes. Approaching the geodesic equations as ordinary differential equations, we demonstrate the development of wave front singularities and time delays between light ray signals. This work demonstrates that the widely used thin lens approximation can be replaced with more robust techniques aligned with general relativity.",
New submissions,Hayward Boson Stars,"Sebastian S. Chicaiza-Medina,Juan Carlos Degollado",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We examined the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics framework that asymptotically supports a Hayward spacetime. We explored the solution space of a static spherically symmetric, complex scalar field minimally coupled to the gravitational field known as Hayward Boson stars originally studied by Yue and Wang. We construct families of Hayward boson stars in the ground state, for different values of the charge parameter $Q$, and different values of the central scalar field. One of the main results of our analysis is the fact that the existence of boson stars is guaranteed once the condition $\frac{\sqrt{\beta}}{Q}> 1.49661$, where $\beta$ is a parameter of the electrodynamic theory, is fulfilled. When this condition is not satisfied the electrovacum spacetime contains at least one horizon and the spacetime can not support a scalar field configuration.",
New submissions,Energy extraction from the accelerating Kerr black hole via magnetic reconnection in the plunging region and circular orbit region,"Ke Wang,Xiao-Xiong Zeng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism, this study investigates how to extract energy effectively from an accelerating Kerr black hole in the plunging region and circular orbit region. After introducing the properties of accelerating black holes, including the event horizon, ergosphere, circular orbits, and innermost stable circular orbit, we investigate the magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region. Specifically, we analyze variations of the azimuthal angle with respect to the acceleration, examine changes in energy per enthalpy of decelerated plasma, and plot energy extraction efficiency along with permissible energy extraction regions. Results show that in the plunging region, at larger radii of reconnection locations, the accelerating black hole exhibits higher energy extraction efficiency than a Kerr black hole. Away from extremality, the acceleration parameter impedes energy extraction, while near extremality, it enhances extraction. We also study energy extraction in circular orbit region by plotting energy extraction efficiency within permissible regions. We find that the permissible energy extraction area is reduced and the efficiency exceeds that of Kerr black holes due to the existence of acceleration parameter. Larger acceleration parameters yield more effective energy extraction regardless of extremality, which is different from that in the plunging region. Additionally, energy extraction efficiency in the plunging region surpasses that in the circular orbit region, aligning with prior conclusions.",
New submissions,Wavelets for power spectral density estimation of gravitational wave data,"Jin-Bao Zhu,Chao-Wan-Zhen Wang,Guo-Qing Huang,Fu-Wen Shu","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)","Power spectral density (PSD) estimation is a critical step in gravitational wave (GW) detectors data analysis. The Welch method is a typical non-parametric spectral estimation approach that estimates the PSD of stationary noise by averaging periodograms of several time segments, or by taking the median of periodograms to adapt to non-stationary noise. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based approach for fast PSD estimation of both stationary and non-stationary noise. For stationary noise, we apply wavelet smoothing to the periodogram, avoiding the segmentation step in the Welch method, and enabling PSD estimates with high frequency resolution and low variance. The wavelet smoothing PSD outperforms Welch PSD in matched filtering and parameter estimation. For non-stationary noise, we estimate the PSD by taking the median of wavelet packet coefficients in each frequency bin, which offers greater robustness than the traditional median periodogram method. This work introduces a new PSD estimation approach for GW data analysis and expands the application of wavelet methods in this field.",
New submissions,Destructuring Physics: A functional derivation of spacetime,Ettore Minguzzi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"I propose that Physics should be formulated using minimal mathematical structure, beginning with its foundational arena: spacetime. This paper opens with a concise overview of several research directions explored in previous work. Among these are the proposal to represent spacetime at the quantum scale using (measure) closed ordered spaces; the unification of causality and topology through quasi-uniformities; the concept of the product trick to unify causality and metricity; the introduction of upper semi-continuous (stable) Lorentzian distances; the representation of spacetime via steep time functions; and the formulation of the Lorentzian distance formula.Subsequently, the properties of the stable distance over stable spacetimes are used as a reference to propose a simplified, abstract notion of spacetime. The discussion shows that spacetime can be introduced in a general and minimalistic way as nothing more than a family of functions defined over an arbitrary set. This abstraction removes unnecessary mathematical complexity, reducing spacetime to its essential elements while preserving its most fundamental physical properties.",
New submissions,The representation of spacetime through time functions,Ettore Minguzzi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The properties of the stable distance over stable spacetimes are used as a reference to propose a simplified, abstract notion of spacetime. The discussion shows that spacetime, with its topology, causal order and (upper semi-continuous) Lorentzian distance, can be introduced in a general and minimalistic way. Specifically, it is shown that spacetime can be represented as nothing more than a family of functions defined over an arbitrary set, the functions being a posteriori interpreted as rushing time functions. The proof makes use of the product trick which reduces causality and metricity to causality in a space with one additional dimension, so leading to a kind of unification for the notions of time function and proper time. Ultimately, our results show that time fully characterizes spacetime.",
New submissions,Polarization Images of Solitonic Boson Stars,"Xiao-Xiong Zeng,Chen-Yu Yang,Hao Yu,Ke-Jian He",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study investigates the polarization characteristics of solitonic boson stars surrounded by a thin accretion disk. By comparing their polarization images with corresponding optical images, we find a positive correlation between the polarization intensity distribution in the polarization images and the brightness in the optical images. Consequently, the strongest polarization occurs at the location corresponding to the direct image. The influence of the coupling strength of the sixtic potential on the polarization intensity distribution is not monotonic, under strong coupling, the polarization will concentrated on the left side of the image as the coupling strength increases, whereas under weak coupling, it is more evenly distributed across the entire direct image as the coupling strength increases. Moreover, we find that as the initial scalar field increases, both the lensing image and photon ring become more prominent. However, the polarization intensity at these regions remains weak. Due to the absence of the event horizon in solitonic boson stars, the polarization vector can penetrate the stellar interior, unlike in black holes, where no polarization signals exist within the event horizon. Our numerical simulations clearly reveal this phenomenon, suggesting that polarization features may serve as an effective tool for distinguishing solitonic boson stars from black holes.",
New submissions,Images and photo regions of continous photon sphere spacetime,"Long-Yue Li,Xia-Yuan Liu,Rong-Gen Cai,Yungui Gong,Wenting Zhou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study images of spacetimes containing continuous photon spheres (CPS). For a self-gravitating, isotropic, spherically symmetric spacetime with CPS, we find that a thin accretion disk produces images that closely resemble those of a Schwarzschild black hole, despite significant differences in photon dynamics. More generally, for any static, pherically symmetric spacetime with a luminous CPS core, the image profile is universal: members of this class produce identical image shapes, differing only by an overall normalization factor. This universality is, however, sensitive to the nature of the accretion flow and breaks down for spherically symmetric infalling accretion, where Doppler shifts and non-static emission introduce image features that depend on the flow dynamics and the metric. Finally, we investigate photon regions in a rotating CPS spacetime and find that unlike in Kerr spacetime, the photon region appears as one or two angular sectors in a constant-$\phi$ cross section. These distinctive photon region properties could produce observable signatures that distinguish rotating CPS spacetimes from the Kerr one.",
New submissions,Kerr spacetime and scalar wave equation: Exact resummation of the renormalized angular momentum in the eikonal limit,"Donato Bini,Giorgio Di Russo,Andrea Geralico",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that the null geodesic radial action for unbound orbits in the Kerr spacetime, and consequently the scattering angle, can be resummed in terms of hypergeometric functions, extending previous results [M.~M.~Ivanov, et al.arXiv:2504.07862]. We provide explicit expressions as series expansions in powers of the Kerr rotational parameter up the fourth order included. We finally use the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism to prove the relation between the renormalized angular momentum and the radial action highlighted in previous works.",
New submissions,Strong Field Scattering of Two Black Holes: Exploring Gauge Flexibility,"Adam Clark,Geraint Pratten",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent advances in post-Minkowskian (PM) gravity provide new avenues for the high precision modelling of compact binaries. In conjunction with the Effective One Body (EOB) formalism, highly accurate PM informed models of binary black holes on scattering trajectories have emerged. Several complementary approaches currently exist, in particular the SEOB-PM model, the $w_{\rm eob}$ framework and the recent LEOB approach. These models incorporate PM results in fundamentally different ways, employing distinct resummation schemes and gauge choices. Notably, both SEOB-PM and LEOB have been used to compute gravitational waves of bound systems, showing excellent agreement with numerical relativity (NR). The essential component to all of the models is the EOB mass-shell condition describing the dynamics of the two-body spacetime. In this work we will investigate how this mass-shell condition is constructed, paying particular attention to the impact of gauge choices and how they interact with different resummation schemes, showing that there is a strong dependence on both coordinate choice and EOB gauge. For the region of parameter space considered, we find that the best performing gauges coincide with the choices made in SEOB-PM and $w_{eob}$, with other choices exhibiting worse performance. The case of spinning black holes is also considered, where the current techniques for spinning EOB-PM are reviewed and compared. We also introduce a new gauge based upon the centrifugal radius, which improves upon previous models, particularly for large and negative spins. This offers a promising avenue for further resummation of spin information within the EOB-PM framework.",
New submissions,Testing General Relativity with Black Holes,Cosimo Bambi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of observational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field regime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars. The past 10 years have seen significant advancements in the study of the strong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray data, and black hole imaging. Here I summarize the state-of-the-art of the tests of General Relativity with black hole X-ray data and I briefly discuss the long-term vision of the possibility of an interstellar mission to the closest black hole for more precise and accurate tests.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics and Joule-Thomson Expansion for Schwarzschild-AdS Black Holes with Cloud of Strings and Quintessential-like Fluid,"Faizuddin Ahmed,Saeed Noori Gashti,Behnam Pourhassan,Abdelmalek Bouzenada",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this study, we explore the thermodynamic properties of a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) embedded in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background, which is further coupled with a cloud of strings and surrounded by a quintessence-like fluid. Beginning with the formulation of BH mass in terms of the event horizon radius, we incorporate the concept of pressure as related to the AdS curvature radius within the framework of extended phase space thermodynamics. Using this setup, we derive key thermodynamic quantities, including the Gibbs free energy and internal energy, to characterize the energetic behavior of the black hole system. To assess the stability of the black hole, we compute the specific heat capacity and analyze how it is influenced by external parameters, such as the string cloud and the quintessence-like fluid. These geometric and matter fields are shown to significantly modify the thermal response of the BH. Furthermore, we examine the inversion temperature associated with the black hole and highlight its distinction from the standard Hawking temperature, providing deeper insight into the phase structure. Additionally, we investigate the Joule-Thomson expansion process and demonstrate how the aforementioned parameters affect this thermodynamic phenomenon, showing important aspects of BH cooling and heating behavior in an extended thermodynamic context.",
New submissions,A Primer on Spacetime Singularities I: Mathematical Framework,Jean-Pierre Luminet,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"This article presents a comprehensive and rigorous overview of spacetime singularities within the framework of classical General Relativity. Singularities are defined through the failure of geodesic completeness, reflecting the limits of predictability in spacetime evolution. The paper reviews the mathematical structures involved, including differentiability classes of the metric, and explores key constructions such as Geroch's and Schmidt's formulations of singular boundaries. A detailed classification of singularities - quasi-regular, non-scalar, and scalar - is proposed, based on the behavior of curvature tensors along incomplete curves. The limitations of previous approaches, including the cosmic censorship conjecture and extensions beyond General Relativity, are critically examined. The work also surveys the major singularity theorems of Penrose and Hawking, emphasizing their implications for gravitational collapse and cosmology. By focusing exclusively on the classical regime, the article lays a solid foundation for the systematic study of singular structures in relativistic spacetimes.",
New submissions,GW200105: A detailed study of eccentricity in the neutron star-black hole binary,"Aasim Jan,Bing-Jyun Tsao,Richard O'Shaughnessy,Deirdre Shoemaker,Pablo Laguna",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"GW200105_162426 is the first neutron star-black hole merger to be confidently confirmed through either gravitational-wave or electromagnetic observations. Although initially analyzed after detection, the event has recently gained renewed attention following a study, Morras et al. (2025), that employed a post-Newtonian inspiral-only waveform model and reported strong evidence for orbital eccentricity. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of GW200105 using state-of-the-art effective-one-body waveform models. Importantly, we present the first study of this event utilizing a physically complete model that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession across the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown stages, along with higher-order gravitational wave modes. Our results support the presence of eccentricity in the signal, with zero eccentricity excluded from $99\%$ credible interval, but yield a mass ratio closer to the original LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis, differing from the findings of Morras et al. (2025). Additionally, similar to previous eccentric-only analysis Planas et al. (2025), we observe a multimodal structure in the eccentricity posterior distribution. We conduct targeted investigations to understand the origin of this multimodality and complement our analysis with numerical relativity simulations to examine how the inclusion of eccentricity impacts the merger dynamics.",
New submissions,Scalarized neutron stars with a highly relativistic core in scalar-tensor gravity,"Peixiang Ji,Lijing Shao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Compact stars in scalar-tensor gravity have been extensively investigated, but relatively few studies have focused on highly relativistic neutron stars (NSs) with an extremely dense core region where the trace of the energy-momentum tensor reverses its sign. In this regime, we identify the origin of the phenomenon where {\it multiple} scalarized solutions exist for a {\it fixed} central density, arising from the oscillatory profile of the scalar field inside the star. This origin further indicates that the multi-branch structure emerges for both negative and positive $\beta$, the quadratic-term coefficient in the effective coupling function between the scalar field and conventional matter in the Einstein frame. By comparing the Damour--Esposito-Farèse and Mendes-Ortiz models of the scalar-tensor gravity, we demonstrate that their distinct scalarization behaviors stem from whether the effective coupling function is bounded. We also compute for scalarized NSs with a highly relativistic dense core in scalar-tensor theories the moment of inertia and tidal deformability that are relevant to pulsar-timing and gravitational-wave experiments.",
New submissions,Black holes of multiple horizons without mass inflation,"Changjun Gao,Toktarbay Sake",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Mass inflation is a phenomenon happened in the vicinity of inner horizon in two-horizon spacetime. It is shown that the mass of initially small perturbations will grow exponentially as they approach the inner horizon. This implies that black hole inner horizon is unstable to the perturbations. In view of the fact that the mass inflation is determined by the surface gravity of inner horizon, Carballo-Rubio et al. showed that if one makes the surface gravity of inner horizon vanish, then the exponential growth character of mass inflation is not present. Basing on this conclusion, we look for the black hole solutions of multiple horizons with nonlinear Maxwell field. Then we make the inner horizons to coincide with each other such that the surface gravities of every inner horizon vanish. By this way, black holes of multiple horizons without mass inflation are constructed.",
New submissions,Electric Penrose process in Ayón-Beato-García (-dS) black holes,"Haowei Chen,Hengyu Xu,Yizhi Zhan,Shao-Jun Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the electric Penrose process in ABG(-dS) regular black holes, examining the influence of the black hole charge and the cosmological constant on the negative-energy region and energy extraction efficiency. Compared with RN(-dS) black holes, ABG(-dS) black holes have a larger negative-energy region, which allows this process to occur farther from the horizons, and higher energy extraction efficiency. This is especially true when the splitting point is close to the event horizon, and the difference widens as the black hole charge increases. Even when the black hole charge and cosmological constant take very small values relevant to astrophysics, significant differences still exist, with the maximum efficiency ratio being approximately 23/8. This indicates that in real astrophysical scenarios, ABG(-dS) black holes can accelerate charged particles more efficiently and exhibit superior energy extraction capabilities compared with RN(-dS) black holes.",
New submissions,Quantum spacetime from constraints: wave equations and fields,Tommaso Favalli,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In previous works, we showed that both time and space can emerge from entanglement within a globally constrained quantum Universe, with no background coordinates. By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the Schrödinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.",
New submissions,Black holes in the external Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin electromagnetic field,Marco Astorino,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism, is built by means of a Lie point symmetry of the Ernst equations, the Harrison transformation. The new spacetime describes a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded into a general external back-reacting electromagnetic field, which is the superposition of the Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson and the Bonnor-Melvin ones. Conserved charges and the first law of thermodynamics are analysed. Swirling generalisations are also considered. Limits to the known metrics such as Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson, Schwarzschild-Bonnor-Melvin and Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin are discussed.",
New submissions,"Comment on ""Black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity""","Zhen-Xiao Zhang,Chen Lan,Yan-Gang Miao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the work [Phys.Rev.D 105 (2022) 2, 024042], D'Ambrosio et al. investigated spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where several solutions satisfy the condition: $g_{tt}g_{rr} = \mathrm{const}$. This condition is characteristic of many black holes, including the Schwarzschild spacetime. In this Comment, we argue that no nontrivial vacuum black hole solutions satisfy this condition in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. We demonstrate our claim by reexamining the field equations under the ""Set 2"" connection called by D'Ambrosio et al., which is necessary for obtaining solutions distinct from those of general relativity (GR). For the case where the free parameters $c$ and $k$ are zero, i.e., Option 2 in their work, we show that any attempt to find a solution beyond GR forces the non-metricity scalar to vanish ($\mathbb{Q}=0$), which trivializes the field equations and does not describe a valid black hole solution. Our findings indicate that the condition, $g_{tt}g_{rr} = \mathrm{const.}$, is overly restrictive for finding new, static and spherically symmetric vacuum black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. This conclusion does not depend on the specific form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$. We also briefly discuss Option 1 that was not addressed in D'Ambrosio et al.'s work, and give new constraints for the selection of parameters $c$ and $k$.",
New submissions,Correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors in five-dimensional black holes,"Hyewon Han,Bogeun Gwak",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors for the five-dimensional Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black hole. The quasinormal modes of gravitational perturbations are computed numerically using the continued fraction method. Particularly, we analyze the scalar, vector, and tensor types of perturbations, noting that the tensor type only exists in spacetimes with more than four dimensions. The grey-body factors are then calculated analytically via the correspondence, using data from the fundamental quasinormal mode and the first overtone. We then compute the grey-body factors independently using a numerical method and find that the results from the two methods coincide. This demonstrates that the correspondence holds with high accuracy for all three types of gravitational perturbations. Furthermore, our results extend the validity of the correspondence to the tensor type, which can only be tested in spacetimes with more than four dimensions.",
New submissions,Including gravity in equilibrium thermodynamics,"Eirini Sourtzinou,Charis Anastopoulos",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech),"This paper is part of a bottom-up approach to gravitational thermodynamics that is guided by the axiomatic frameworks of equilibrium thermodynamics. We identify a novel form of the microcanonical distribution for systems in background gravitational fields that respects the kinetic theory and the thermodynamic symmetries. Thermodynamic consistency dictates the treatment of the gravitational field as a thermodynamic variable. We introduce the thermodynamic conjugate to the gravitational field, the gravitational pull, an additive variable that is a structural element of our microcanonical distribution. We demonstrate the validity of our results to inhomogenous background fields, a class of self-gravitating systems, relativistic gases in Rindler spacetime, and quantum gases.",
New submissions,Primary hairs may create echoes,"R. A. Konoplya,A. Zhidenko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In most scenarios studied so far, the appearance of echoes in the ringdown signal requires modifications external to the black hole itself, such as the presence of matter in the near-horizon region, quantum field clouds, or exotic compact objects like wormholes that effectively introduce additional peaks in the effective potential. In this work we show that echoes can naturally arise in a different setting: black holes endowed with primary Proca-Gauss-Bonnet hair. We demonstrate that the primary hair modifies the effective potential in such a way that a second peak is formed, giving rise to late-time echoes without invoking any external environment or exotic horizon-scale physics. Using both the higher-order WKB method with Padé resummation and time-domain integration, we compute the quasinormal spectrum for scalar and Dirac test fields and show the appearance of these echoes. Our results highlight a novel mechanism by which primary hairs alone can leave observable imprints on the ringdown signal of black holes in modified gravity.",
Cross submissions,Observational constraints on holography in $(2 + 1)$-dimensional cosmology with a generalized equation of state,"Praveen Kumar Dhankar,Safiqul Islam,Saibal Ray,Aritra Sanyal,S. K. Maurya",General Physics (physics.gen-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this study we explore the cosmic holographic principle, as proposed by Fischler and Susskind~\cite{Fischler}, within the framework of $(2 + 1)$-dimensional cosmological models. A generalized equation of state is employed, given by $p = (\zeta - 1)(\rho + \rho_0)$, where $\zeta$ and $\rho_0$ are treated as two free parameters. The analysis confirms the validity of the holographic principle in all flat and open universes. However, for a $(2 + 1)$-dimensional closed universe, we apply the method proposed by Kaloper and Linde~\cite{Kaloper}, and observe that the holographic principle is generally not satisfied. Furthermore, we examine the stability of the proposed model using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, and estimate the best-fit values for the model parameters based on observational Hubble data sets.",
Cross submissions,Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum,Philip A. LeMaitre,Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.",
Cross submissions,Limitations in constraining neutron star radii and nuclear properties from inspiral gravitational wave detections,"Zhenyu Zhu,Richard O'Shaughnessy",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"We investigate the constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and nuclear properties achievable with third-generation gravitational wave detectors using the Fisher information matrix approach. Assuming an optimistic binary neutron star (BNS) merger rate, we generate synthetic inspiral gravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to one year of observation. From these simulated data, we compute the covariance matrix and posterior distributions for nuclear properties and EoS. Our results show that the EoS can be tightly constrained, particularly in the density range between one and four times nuclear saturation density. However, due to the scarcity of of low-mass neutron stars in the GW sample, the EoS at sub-saturation densities remains poorly constrained. Thus, in turn, leads to weaker constraints on neutron star radii, as the radii are sensitive to the low-density EoS. Additionally, We note that the nuclear properties are degenerate in their influence on the EoS, making them difficult to be constrained through GW observations alone. These highlights inherent limitations of inspiral GW signals in probing dense matter properties. Therefore, precise radius measurements, post-merger GW observations, and supplementary constraints from terrestrial nuclear experiments remain essential for a comprehensive understanding of dense matter.",
Cross submissions,Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities,Kyu-Hyun Chae,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.",
Cross submissions,On constraining initial orbital eccentricity of purely inspiral events,"Hemantakumar Phurailatpam,Gopakumar Achamveedu,Maria Haney,Tjonnie Li,Srishti Tiwari",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA consortium has sporadically detected purely inspiral gravitational-wave events like GW170817 and GW190425. These events offer an opportunity to constrain the presence of possible initial (residual) orbital eccentricities while using purely inspiral template families. We detail the implementation of a LSC Algorithm Library Suite approximant, TaylorF2Ecck, which models analytically inspiral gravitational waves from non-spinning compact binaries in Post-Newtonian accurate eccentric orbits while restricting the initial-eccentricity contributions to its leading order. Specifically, our frequency domain approximant consistently incorporates the orbital, advance of periastron, and gravitational-wave emission effects fully up to the 3PN order. We pursue detailed parameter estimation studies of GW170817 and GW190425 using TaylorF2Ecck, after performing comprehensive sanity checks to validate the model's performance and investigate the influence of periastron advance in the relevant parameter space. The results indicate that initial-eccentricity at 20 Hz is essentially zero (less than 0.011 for GW170817 and less than 0.028 for GW190425) at a 90 percent confidence level. We compare posteriors for these two events that arise from a few purely inspiral eccentric approximants and point out certain subtle effects arising due to the inclusion of periastron advance. Additionally, these detailed studies reveal the importance of incorporating initial eccentricity contributions at least up to 3.5PN-order and discuss its implications. We substantiate this inference by employing versions of quasi-circular TaylorF2 approximant that incorporate Fourier phase contributions beyond the conventional 3.5PN order.",
Cross submissions,Interact or Twist: Cosmological Correlators from Field Redefinitions Revisited,"Donggang Wang,Xiangwei Wang,Yi Wang,Wenqi Yu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In cosmology, correlation functions on a late-time boundary can arise from both field redefinitions and bulk interactions, which are usually believed to generate distinct results. In this letter, we propose a counterexample showcasing that correlators from local field redefinitions can be identical to the ones from bulk interactions. In particular, we consider a two-field model in de Sitter space, where the field space gets twisted by field redefinitions to yield a nontrivial reheating surface. We then exploit conformal symmetry to compute the three-point function, and show that the result takes the form of contact correlators with a total-energy singularity. Our finding suggests that in the effective field theory, a class of lower-dimensional operators, which were overlooked previously, may lead to nontrivial signals in cosmological correlators. As an illustration, we apply our result to cosmic inflation and derive a possibly leading signature of the Higgs in the primordial bispectrum.",
Cross submissions,Mastering Cosmological Amplitudes Using Generalized Ramanujan's Theorem,"Prashanth Raman,Qinglin Yang",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We present a systematic method for computing cosmological amplitudes, including in-in correlators and wavefunction coefficients, in FRW spacetime. Specializing to cases with conformally-coupled external scalars and massive scalar exchanges, we introduce a decomposition into massive family trees, which capture the nested time structure common to these observables. We then evaluate these building blocks using the Method of Brackets (MoB), a multivariate extension of Ramanujan's master theorem that operates directly on the integrand, translating integrals into discrete summations via a compact set of algebraic rules. This yields infinite series representations valid across the full space of external momenta and internal energies. We also develop Feynman-like diagrammatic rules that map interaction graphs to summand structures, enabling efficient and scalable computation. The resulting expressions make time evolution manifest, smoothly interpolate to the conformal limit, and are well suited for both numerical evaluation and analytic analysis of massive field effects in cosmology.",
