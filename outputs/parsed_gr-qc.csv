New submissions,Lower bound on the proper lengths of stationary bound-state charged massive scalar clouds,Shahar Hod,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"It has recently been revealed that charged scalar clouds, spatially regular matter configurations which are made of linearized charged massive scalar fields, can be supported by spinning and charged Kerr-Newman black holes. Using analytical techniques, we establish a no-short hair theorem for these stationary bound-state field configurations. In particular, we prove that the effective proper lengths of the supported charged massive scalar clouds are bounded from below by the remarkably compact dimensionless relation $\ell/M>\ln(3+\sqrt{8})$, where $M$ is the mass of the central supporting black hole. Intriguingly, this lower bound is universal in the sense that it is valid for all Kerr-Newman black-hole spacetimes [that is, in the entire regime $\{a/M\in(0,1],Q/M\in[0,1)\}$ of the dimensionless spin and charge parameters that characterize the central supporting black holes] and for all values of the physical parameters (electric charge $q$, proper mass $\mu$, and angular harmonic indexes $\{l,m\}$) that characterize the supported stationary bound-state scalar fields.",
New submissions,Dynamical black holes and accretion-induced backreaction,"Thiago de L. Campos,C. Molina,Mario C. Baldiotti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the evolution of future trapping horizons through the dynamics of the Misner-Sharp mass using ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. Our analysis shows that an integral formulation of Hayward's first law governs much of the evolution of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. To account for the accretion backreaction, we consider a near-horizon approximation, yielding first-order corrections of a Vaidya-dark energy form. We further propose a systematic perturbative scheme to study these effects for an arbitrary background. As an application, we analyze an accreting Reissner-Nordström black hole and demonstrate the horizon shifts that are produced. Finally, we compute accretion-induced corrections to an extremal configuration. It is shown that momentum influx and energy density produce distinct effects: the former forces the splitting of the extremal horizon, while the latter induces significant displacements in its position, computed up to first-order perturbative corrections. These results highlight how different components of the stress-energy tensor significantly affect horizon geometry, with potential implications for broader areas of research, including black-hole thermodynamics.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics of an universe with Decaying Cold Dark Matter,"Javier Juárez-Jiménez,Ana A. Avilez-López,Miguel Cruz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work we focus on the thermodynamics consistency of a new set of solutions emerging from a cosmology in which dark matter is able to decay into relativistic particles within the dark sector. It is important to stress that the lifetime of dark matter is larger than the age of the universe in order to be consistent with observations. Given that the corresponding decay rate is small, this one can be used as a perturbative parameter and it is possible to construct analytic solutions from a perturbative analysis for the densities of the species and the scale factor. The decay of dark matter is an irreversible process since it occurs out of chemical equilibrium and therefore the entropy per comoving volume increases considerably, as a consequence the temperature does not scale as $a^{-1}$ in contrast to an adiabatic expansion. We take into account two scenarios: a) The case in which both species making up the fluid end up in thermal equilibrium and therefore their temperature is the same. b) A second instance in which the species do not reach thermal equilibrium and therefore they have different temperatures. We verify that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied in any case.",
New submissions,Lorentz-violating wormholes: The role of the matter coupled to Lorentz-violating fields,"Renan B. Magalhães,Leandro A. Lessa,Rodolfo Casana",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The anisotropies induced by Lorentz-violating fields pose significant challenges for the search for compact objects in non-vacuum environments. In this work, we demonstrate that introducing couplings between Lorentz-violating fields and matter facilitates the formation of traversable wormholes. Specifically, we introduce additional couplings in the Lagrangian of a phantom scalar field and derive Ellis-Bronnikov spacetime analogs in three distinct Lorentz-violating scenarios: (I) modifications arising from the vacuum expectation value of the bumblebee field, (II) contributions from the vacuum expectation value of an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field, and (III) a combined scenario incorporating both fields. In the latter case, despite the distinct nature of the fields, their non-zero vacuum expectation values contribute additively to the overall effect on the phantom distribution and on the resulting line element. Moreover, we consider scalar waves to probe the effects of the Lorentz violation in these spacetimes. Notably, the additional Lorentz-violating couplings can alter scalar field dynamics such that perturbations propagate as if in a General Relativity background, which allows for some traits of Lorentz violation to be hidden. We compute the quasinormal mode spectra of these perturbations using three methods: direct integration, 6th-order WKB approximation, and the Prony method, finding strong agreement among the results.",
New submissions,Vacuum Phase Transitions and the Temperature of the Universe,"V.G. Lapchinsky,V.A. Rubakov,A.V. Veryaskin",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),The authors discuss a possibility that the present great value of aT ( a is the radius of spatial curvature and T is the temperature of the Universe ) was generated by first order vacuum phase transitions. In Coleman-Weinberg type models such transitions are natural and they rise the value of aT from unity to an exponentially large value. Some GUTs are briefly discussed in this contest.,
New submissions,Cosmological Perturbations of Extended NGR Model with Parity Violation,"Yuxuan Kang,Mingzhe Li,Yeheng Tong",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recently the modified teleparallel gravity models attracted a lot of interests. In this paper we consider more extensions to the New General Relativity (NGR) model with parity violations. This extended NGR model differs from the normal NGR model by the inclusion of additional parity-odd term that is quadratic in the torsion tensor. By investigating its cosmological perturbations of this model, we find that this model can avoid ghost instabilities in certain regions of the parameter space, where the coefficient of the parity-odd term does not vanish.",
New submissions,Extreme mass-ratio inspirals and extra dimensions: Insights from modified Teukolsky framework,"Shailesh Kumar,Tieguang Zi,Arpan Bhattacharyya",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) offer a promising avenue to test extra-dimensional physics through gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this work, we study equatorial eccentric EMRIs around a spherically symmetric braneworld black hole, focusing on the influence of a tidal charge parameter arising as extra dimensions. Using the fact of tr-symmetry of the spacetime under consideration, we implement the Modified Teukolsky Equation (MTE) framework and compute observables, as well as compare the results with those from the standard Teukolsky formalism for general relativity (GR). Our analysis reveals significant deviations in dephasing and mismatch values, especially for the higher eccentricities. These findings highlight not only the observational potential of future low-frequency detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) but also the necessity of using the MTE framework for accurately modeling binaries in theories beyond GR.",
New submissions,A covariant approach to the Dirac field in LRS space-times,"Stefano Vignolo,Giuseppe De Maria,Luca Fabbri,Sante Carloni",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We use the polar decomposition to describe the Dirac field in terms of an effective spinorial fluid. After reformulating all covariant equations in ``spinorial'' signature $(+ -- )$, we develop a $(1+1+2)$ covariant approach for the Dirac field that does not require the use of tetrad fields or Clifford matrices. By identifying the velocity and spin fields as the generators of time-like and space-like congruences, we examine the compatibility of a self-gravitating Dirac field with Locally Rotationally Symmetric space-times of types I, II, and III. We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our construction.",
New submissions,Scattering of a point mass by a Schwarzschild black hole: radiated energy and angular momentum,Andrea Geralico,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The radiated energy and angular momentum from a point mass on a hyperbolic-like orbit about a Schwarzschild black hole are computed for the first time in the framework of the first-order self-force theory. The analytical expressions for the fluxes are obtained through the standard method of Mano, Suzuki and Takasugi in the form of combined post-Minkowskian (PM) and post-Newtonian (PN) expansions. The reached PM accuracy for the energy and angular momentum losses is $O(G^5)$ and $O(G^4)$, respectively, and 7PN for both. The radiative losses (energy, angular momentum and linear momentum) are currently known in PN-expanded form up to the (fractional) 3PN order [D. Bini et al., Phys. Rev. D \textbf{107}, 024012 (2023)]. Exact PM results valid for arbitrary values of the velocity are limited to $O(G^4)$ for the energy and $O(G^3)$ for the angular momentum. An exact expression for the radiated energy at $O(G^5)$ has been recently obtained in [M. Driesse et al., Nature \textbf{641}, 603-607 (2025)] in the first-order self force limit, whereas the $O(G^4)$ radiated angular momentum has been partially determined in [C. Heissenberg, Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111}, 126012 (2025)]. The results of this work are in agreement with the state of the art of both energy and angular momentum losses, also completing the knowledge of the 4PM radiated angular momentum up to the reached PN accuracy. The expressions for radiative losses are then used to get the 5PM radiation-reacted scattering angle, which should also serve as a cross-check of ongoing calculations by other methods.",
New submissions,Spherical Orbital Dynamics and Relativistic Precession in Kerr-MOG Spacetime,"Hui-Min Wang,Kai Liao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We study the dynamics and relativistic precessions of massive particles on spherical orbits around Kerr-MOG black holes in scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG). By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we derive conserved quantities and analyze how the MOG parameter $\alpha$ and orbital tilt angle $\zeta$ influence the innermost stable spherical orbits (ISSOs) and orbital stability. We compute the nodal and periastron precession frequencies, finding that nodal precession increases monotonically with both black hole spin and MOG parameter, while periastron precession exhibits a more complex behavior: MOG amplifies curvature-induced effects, which can be partially counteracted by spin. Furthermore, to complement the orbital analysis, we examine the Lense-Thirring spin precession of a gyroscope and demonstrate its sensitivity to the MOG parameter, spin, and orbital tilt angle. These results reveal distinctive signatures of modified gravity in orbital dynamics and provide a potential observational probe to test deviations from general relativity near rotating black holes.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics in space-times without horizons,"Raymond Isichei,João Magueijo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider the energetics and thermodynamics of spacetimes with no horizons, but endowed with a preferred timelike junction surface. They could arise as a limiting case of the gravastar and other constructions regularizing the interior of the horizon of a black hole, or from the conceptual cutting of a portion of a non-asymptotically flat space and gluing it with flat space. We find that such surfaces can be made to have zero energy, so that the energetics of such spaces is not encumbered by them. They do have a transverse pressure, fixed by the jump in surface gravity. A peculiar matter thermodynamics then follows, with well defined entropy, temperature and surface pressure, constrained by specific relations arising from the zero energy condition. This is confirmed by the Euclidean path integral, with the proviso that the Tolman-Ehrenfest temperature should be used. The entropy of the space is then the area of the timelike surface in units of a fundamental area, and the matter temperature is proportional to the transverse pressure and so the jump in surface gravity. However, when the gravitational action is added, the free energy of the surface is also zero. The fact that for some such spaces the temperature comes out negative raises interesting questions regarding the third law of thermodynamics.",
New submissions,Ring formation from black hole superradiance through repeated particle production on bound orbits,"Zhen-Hong Lyu,Rong-Gen Cai,Zong-Kuan Guo,Jian-Feng He,Jing Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Ultralight bosonic fields around a rotating black hole can extract energy and angular momentum through the superradiant instability and form a dense cloud. We investigate the scenario involving two scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$, with a coupling term $\frac{1}{2}\lambda\phi\chi^2$, which is motivated by the multiple-axion framework. The ultralight scalar $\phi$ forms a cloud that efficiently produces $\chi$ particles non-perturbatively via parametric resonance, with a large mass hierarchy, $\mu_\chi \gg \mu_\phi$. Rather than escaping the system as investigated by previous studies, these $\chi$ particles remain bound, orbiting the black hole. Moreover, the particle production occurs primarily at the peak of the cloud's profile, allowing $\chi$ particles in quasi-circular orbits to pass repeatedly through resonant regions, leading to sustained amplification. This selective process naturally forms a dense ring of $\chi$ particles, with a mass ratio to the cloud fixed by $(\mu_\phi/\mu_\chi)^2$. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for generating bound-state particles via parametric resonance, which also impacts the evolution of the cloud. This process can be probed through its imprint on binary dynamics and its gravitational-wave signatures.",
New submissions,Stability and Criticality Behaviors of Accelerating Charged AdS Black Holes in Rainbow Gravity,"Hajar Belmahi,Maryem Jemri,Rajaa Salih",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we investigate the thermodynamical properties of accelerated charged Anti-de Sitter black holes in the context of rainbow gravity. Concretely, we compute the corresponding quantities needed to study the thermal stability and the critical behaviors including the phase transitions. Linking the acceleration parameter $A$ and the horizon radius $r_h$ via a constant parameter $a$, we discuss the $P$-$v$ criticality behaviors by calculating the critical pressure $P_c$, the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical specific volume $v_c$ in terms of $a$ and the rainbow gravity parameter $\varepsilon$. As results, we reveal that the ratio $ \dfrac{P_{c}v_{c}}{T_{c}}$ is an universal number with respect to the charge. In small limits of the external parameters, we recover the Van der Waals fluid behaviors.",
New submissions,Cauchy Horizon (In)Stability of Regular Black Holes,"Alfio Bonanno,Antonio Panassiti,Frank Saueressig",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"A common feature of regular black hole spacetimes is the presence of an inner Cauchy horizon. The analogy to the Reissner-Nordström solution then suggests that these geometries suffer from a mass-inflation effect, rendering the Cauchy horizon unstable. Recently, it was shown that this analogy fails for certain classes of regular black holes, including the Hayward solution, where the late-time behavior of the mass function no longer grows exponentially but follows a power law. In this work, we extend these results in a two-fold way. First, we determine the basin-of-attraction for the power-law attractor, showing that the tamed growth of the mass function is generic. Second, we extend the systematic analysis to the Bardeen geometry, the Dymnikova black hole, and a spacetime arising from a non-singular collapse model newly proposed in the context of asymptotically safe quantum gravity. Remarkably, in the latter solution, the Misner-Sharp mass at the Cauchy horizon remains of the same order of magnitude of the mass of the black hole, since its growth is just logarithmic.",
New submissions,Quasi-normal modes and absorption section from regular black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter,"L. O. Téllez Tovar,Omar Pedraza,L. A. López,R. Arceo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations in the Hayward, Bardeen and Ayon-Beato-Garciá (ABG) Black Holes immersed in Perfect Fluid Dark Matter. Using the sixth order WKB approaches and AIM we determined dependence of the quasi-normal modes on the parameter of the Black Holes and the test fields. Finally, we study the absorption section of the different Black Holes immersed in Perfect Fluid Dark Matter.",
New submissions,Dymnikova Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence,"M. H. Macêdo,J. Furtado,R. R. Landim",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Dymnikova black hole (BH) is a regular solution that interpolates between a de Sitter core near the origin and a Schwarzschild-like behavior at large distances. In this work, we investigate the properties of a Dymnikova BH immersed in a quintessential field, characterized by the state parameter $\omega$ and a normalization constant $c$. We explore the thermodynamic behavior, null geodesics, scalar quasinormal modes and shadow profiles for this model. Our analysis shows that the presence of quintessence alters the Hawking temperature and specific heat, leading to parameter-dependent phase transitions. The null geodesics and corresponding black hole shadows are also found to be sensitive to the model parameters, especially $\omega$ and $c$. This sensitivity influences light deflection and shadow size. Furthermore, we compute the scalar quasinormal modes and observe that quintessence tends to enhance the damping of the modes, indicating greater stability under perturbations.",
New submissions,Black-Hole Thermodynamics from Gauge Freedom in Extended Iyer-Wald Formalism,"Thiago de L. Campos,Mario C. Baldiotti,C. Molina",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Thermodynamic systems admit multiple equivalent descriptions related by transformations that preserve their fundamental structure. This work focuses on exact isohomogeneous transformations (EITs), a class of mappings that keep fixed the set of independent variables of the thermodynamic potential, while preserving both the original homogeneity and the validity of a first law. Our investigation explores EITs within the extended Iyer--Wald formalism for theories containing free parameters (e.g., the cosmological constant). EITs provide a unifying framework for reconciling the diverse formulations of Kerr-anti de Sitter (KadS) thermodynamics found in the literature. While the Iyer--Wald formalism is a powerful tool for deriving first laws for black holes, it typically yields a non-integrable mass variation that prevents its identification as a proper thermodynamic potential. To address this issue, we investigate an extended Iyer--Wald formalism where mass and thermodynamic volume become gauge dependent. Within this framework, we identify the gauge choices and Killing vector normalizations that are compatible with EITs, ensuring consistent first laws. As a key application, we demonstrate how conventional KadS thermodynamics emerges as a special case of our generalized approach.",
New submissions,Impact of flavor condensate dark matter on accretion disk luminosity in spherical spacetimes,"Antonio Capolupo,Orlando Luongo,Aniello Quaranta",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the impact of dark matter condensates on the emission and thermodynamic properties of accretion disks, in a spherically-symmetric and static background. We focus on a class of models where dark matter originates from a genuine mass mixing among neutrino fields and compute the corrections to the dark matter's potential within galactic halo. We find a corresponding Yukawa correction induced by the dark matter energy-momentum tensor over the Newtonian potential. In so doing, employing Schwarzschild coordinates, and adopting the Novikov-Thorne formalism, we compute the geodesic structure and the corresponding disk-integrated luminosity profiles. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate, constituted solely by baryonic matter, we find non-negligible deviations in both the disk structure and radiative output, as compared to the standard Schwarzschild case. Afterwards, we discuss physical consequences of our Yukawa correction, comparing it with recent literature, predicting similar potentials, albeit derived from extended theories of gravity. Accordingly, we thus speculate to use our results to distinguish among candidates of dark matter. Indeed, our findings suggest that incoming high-precision observations of accretion disk spectra may provide a tool to probe dark matter's nature under the form of particles, extended theories of gravity or condensates.",
New submissions,Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy: A Brief Overview,"Ricardo Bulcão Valente Ferrari,Samuel Bueno Soltau",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"In the early 1970s, Jacob Bekenstein proposed that black holes possess an entropy proportional to the area of their event horizon, introducing the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics. Stephen Hawking initially objected to this idea, but his subsequent analysis of quantum field theory in curved spacetime led to the prediction of Hawking radiation and the concept of black hole temperature. This study offers a concise overview of the development of black hole thermodynamics between 1972 and 1975, highlighting the theoretical evolution of both Bekenstein's and Hawking's contributions. The work also reflects on the lasting impact of these developments on modern theoretical physics and quantum gravity.",
New submissions,Geometric Modeling of a Line of Alternating Disclinations: Application to Grain Boundaries in Graphene,"A. M. de M. Carvalho,C. Furtado",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci),"We develop a conformal geometric model for grain boundaries in graphene based on a periodic line of alternating disclinations. Within the framework of (2+1)-dimensional gravity, we solve a reduced form of the Einstein equations to determine the conformal factor, from which the induced metric, scalar curvature, and holonomy are obtained analytically. Each pentagon-heptagon pair is modeled as a disclination dipole, forming a continuous distribution that captures the geometric signature of experimentally observed 5-7 grain boundaries. We show that the curvature is localized near the defect line and that the geometry becomes asymptotically flat, with trivial holonomy at large distances. This construction provides a tractable and physically consistent realization of the Katanaev-Volovich framework, connecting topological defect theory with atomistic features of graphene.",
New submissions,Stability and Thermodynamics of a Generalized Power-Law Dark Energy Model,"S. Kazemi,M. A. Ramzanpour,E. Yusofi,A. R. Amani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate a generalized power-law dark energy equation of state of the form \( p = w\rho - \beta\rho^m \) in a flat FLRW universe, analyzing its dynamical stability and thermodynamic consistency. The model exhibits a rich phase space structure, with an effective cosmological constant \(\rho^* = [(1+w)/\beta]^{1/(m-1)}\) emerging as a stable attractor for \((w < -1,~ m > 1)\). Notably, the universe evolves from an early de Sitter phase (\(w \to -1\)) to a late-time de Sitter-like one with phantom crossing (\(w(z) < -1\)), aligning with DESI observations. Dynamical analysis reveals that the \(m > 1\) regime avoids ghost instabilities while accommodating phantom behavior, with \(m = 2\) providing particular theoretical advantages. Thermodynamically, the Generalized Second Law holds when the null energy condition \(\rho + p \geq 0\) is satisfied, which naturally occurs for \(\rho \geq \rho^*\). The model's compatibility with both observational data and fundamental thermodynamic principles suggests it as a viable framework for describing late-time cosmic acceleration, resolving tensions associated with phantom crossing while maintaining entropy dominance of the cosmological horizon.",
New submissions,Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows,"Hao Yin,Songbai Chen,Jiliang Jing",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We have investigated the bright ring-like features and polarization structuresin the Kerr-Sen black hole's images based on general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, which are illuminated by the 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from the radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Using the REx method, we extracted the bright ring from the black hole images and found that both the bright ring and black hole shadow shrink as the dilation parameter increases. Combing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters for different observed inclinations and disk thicknesses. Our results show that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are more strong than those of the observed inclination. We also probe the rotational symmetry of EVPA in the polarization structure of the black hole images by analyzing the coefficient $\beta_2$. The dilaton parameter results in that the real part $Re\beta_2$ increases and the imaginary part $Im\beta_2$ decreases, but the magnitude $|\beta_2|$ generally exhibits a declining trend. Finally, we find that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.",
New submissions,Study of Wormhole in $f(Q)$ gravity with some dark energy models,"Tanmoy Chowdhury,Prabir Rudra,Tandrima Chowdhury,Farook Rahaman",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study discusses the development of some particular static wormhole models in the background of an extended $f(Q)$ gravity theory. Wormhole solutions are derived by considering the radial pressure to admit an equation of state corresponding to Chaplygin gas. The Chaplygin gas equation of state is taken into consideration in two different forms: $p_{r}=-\frac{Bb(r)^{u}}{\rho^{a}}$, $p_{r}=-\frac{B}{\rho^{a}}$. Wormhole models are also generated assuming that a variable barotropic fluid may explain the radial pressure given by $p_{r} =-\omega\rho b(r)^u$. For every model, the shape function $b(r)$ is the function that can be derived from the wormhole metric in any scenario. The stability analysis of the wormhole solutions and the shape function viability for each situation are thenthis http URLeach wormhole model is shown to violate the null energy condition (NEC), it can be understood that these wormholes are traversable. More generally, we investigate whether the model is stable under the hydrostatic equilibrium state condition using the TOVthis http URLphysical characteristics of these models are shown under the same energy circumstances. The typical characteristic is the radial pressure $p_{r}$ near the wormhole throat, which violates the NEC $(\rho+P_{r} \geq0)$. In some models, it is possible to meet the NEC at the neck and yet violate the DEC $(\rho - P_{r}\geq0)$. In summary, precise wormhole models may be generated, provided that $(\rho\geq0)$, and there may be a potential breach of the NEC at the wormhole's throat.",
New submissions,Spherical photon orbits around the Kerr-like black hole in Einstein-Bumblebee gravity,"Shi-Yu Li,Song-Shan Luo,Zhong-Wen Feng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate the photon orbits around a Kerr-like black hole in Einstein-Bumblebee gravity, where Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken. By solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, we derive a sixth-order polynomial that governs the photon motion, explicitly dependent on the rotation parameter $u$, the Lorentz violation parameter $\ell$, and the effective inclination angle $v$. We analyze photon orbit configurations in polar, equatorial, and general inclined planes, identifying significant deviations from the Kerr solution. In the polar and equatorial planes, we identify distinct photon orbit configurations and analyze their dependence on model parameters. For general inclined orbits, we find a critical inclination angle $v$ that determines the number and location of photon orbits in both extremal and non-extremal cases. All photon orbits are radially unstable, and the critical impact parameter decreases with increasing Lorentz violation, potentially providing observable signatures to differentiate Einstein-Bumblebee gravity from general relativity.",
New submissions,In-depth analysis of violations of the (strong) equivalence principle in scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories,"Martín G. Richarte,Júnior D. Toniato",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We conducted a theoretical analysis of the violation of the equivalence principle within a broad class of scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories that exhibit spontaneous scalarization. Beginning with the Jordan frame, we performed a conformal mapping to identify the equivalent model in the Einstein frame. This approach revealed that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling introduces a mixed term that links the Einstein tensor to the kinetic terms, along with an additional kinetic term associated with the box operator, echoing characteristics of Horndeski-like theories. Our findings confirm a violation of the weak equivalence principle, as the geodesic equation incorporates an extra term that, in the non-relativistic limit, leads to a modified Newtonian equation. This result was further corroborated using Eardley's methodology. We also examined the violation of the strong equivalence principle through the Nordtvedt effect within the framework of an extended parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism. We provide a concrete example of scalarized theories featuring extended PPN parameters that deviate from general relativity, comparing these results against observational constraints from the Cassini mission, the MESSENGER mission, and the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment. While the Cassini bounds remain the most stringent, the constraints on the Nordtvedt parameter offer significantly better restrictions on the parameter space than those derived from the precession rate of Mercury's perihelion.",
New submissions,Forces parallel to particle trajectories in relativistic gravity,"Valerio Faraoni,Luca Valsan,Uri Gorman",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Forces parallel to particle trajectories occur in physically meaningful situations, including relativistic cosmology and Einstein frame scalar-tensor gravity. These situations have Newtonian analogues that we discuss to provide intuition about the underlying physics.",
New submissions,The Study on Modified Theories of General Relativity: A Differential Geometric Approach,N.S. Kavya,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The introduction of General Relativity (GR) in 1915 revolutionized our understanding of gravity, but over time, its limitations in explaining phenomena like dark energy, dark matter, and quantum gravity have motivated alternative theories. Early modifications, such as Weyl's 1919 proposal, focused on adding higher-order terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. GR's non-renormalizability further strengthened the case for extending it. A central theme of modern gravity research is modifying the geometric structure, often by changing the gravitational Lagrangian. This leads to theories such as teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel gravity, utilizing torsion or non-Levi-Civita connections, with differential geometry providing the essential framework.This thesis explores several modified gravity models. Chapter 1 introduces necessary mathematical tools. Chapter 2 develops a novel parametrization of the deceleration parameter, constrained using MCMC and observational data, and applies it to f(Q) gravity. Chapter 3 embeds the LambdaCDM model into f(Q, L\_m) gravity with non-minimal coupling, producing analytic solutions and matching observations through cosmographic analysis. Chapter 4 considers Bianchi-I spacetime in f(R, L\_m) gravity with observational constraints to measure anisotropy. Chapter 5 presents wormhole solutions in f(Q, T) gravity with conformal symmetries. Chapter 6 explores wormholes in f(R, L\_m) with non-commutative geometry, analyzing shape functions, energy conditions, and stability. Chapter 7 studies Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in f(T) gravity, constraining hybrid models using early- and late-time data, and validating intermediate epochs via cosmography.",
New submissions,Relativistic massive compact stars supported by decoupled matter: Implications for mass-radius bounds,"S. K. Maurya,A. Errehymy,Ksh. Newton Singh,G. Mustafa,Saibal Ray",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The merger of binary neutron stars (BNSs) is a remarkable astrophysical event where all four fundamental forces interplay dynamically across multiple stages, producing a rich spectrum of multi-messenger signals. These observations present a significant multiphysics modeling challenge but also offer a unique opportunity to probe the nature of gravity and the strong nuclear interaction under extreme conditions. The landmark detection of GW170817 provided essential constraints on the properties of non-rotating neutron stars (NSs), including their maximum mass (M_{max}) and radius distribution, thereby informing the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense nuclear matter. While the inspiral phase of such events has been extensively studied, the post-merger signal holds even greater potential to reveal the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities, particularly in scenarios involving a transition to deconfined quark matter. Motivated by the recent gravitational wave event GW190814 (2.5-2.67 M_{\odot}), we revisit the modeling of high-mass compact stars to investigate their internal structure via a generalized polytropic EOS. This framework incorporates a modified energy density profile and is coupled with the TOV equations. We explore mass-radius (M-R) relationships within both GR and the minimal geometric deformation (MGD) approach. Specifically, we constrain the radii of four massive compact objects PSR J1614-2230 (1.97^{+0.04}_{-0.04}\,M_{\odot}), PSR J0952-0607 (2.35^{+0.17}_{-0.17}\,M_\odot), GW190814 (2.5-2.67\,M_\odot), and GW200210 (2.83^{+0.47}_{-0.42}\,M_\odot) and demonstrate that our theoretical M-R curves are consistent with observational data. These findings provide meaningful constraints on the EOS and underscore the potential of alternative gravity models to accommodate ultra-massive compact stars within a physically consistent framework.",
New submissions,"Growth Rate Analysis in $f(R,L_m)$ Gravity: A Comparative Study with \boldmath$Λ$CDM Cosmology","G. K. Goswami,J. P. Saini",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the evolution of cosmic structures within the framework of modified gravity, specifically focusing on theories described by the function $f(R, L_m)$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $L_m$ is the matter Lagrangian. This class of models introduces a non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter, leading to modifications in the dynamics of density perturbations. We derive the linear growth equation and compute the observable growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$, which is directly accessible from redshift-space distortion (RSD) data. Using recent observational constraints from galaxy surveys such as eBOSS and DESI, we perform a comparative analysis between predictions from $f(R, L_m)$ gravity and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results indicate that while $\Lambda$CDM remains broadly consistent with current data, the $f(R, L_m)$ framework can accommodate subtle deviations in structure growth, offering a possible resolution to existing tensions in large-scale structure observations. We also outline the implications of our findings for future surveys, including Euclid and LSST.",
New submissions,Primordial Black Hole Ringdown: the Irreducible Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background,"Valerio De Luca,Antonio J. Iovino,Antonio Riotto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Independently from the formation mechanism of primordial black holes in the early universe, their generation is accompanied by a ringdown phase during which they relax to a stationary configuration and gravitational waves under the form of quasinormal modes are emitted. Such gravitational waves generate an irreducible and unavoidable stochastic background which is testable by current and future experiments. In particular, the presence of a primordial black hole ringdown allows to significantly constrain the idea of extremely supermassive black holes to comprise the entire dark matter of the universe.",
New submissions,Inflaton perturbations through an Ultra-Slow Roll transition and Hamilton-Jacobi attractors,"Tomislav Prokopec,Gerasimos Rigopoulos",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We examine the behaviour of the gauge invariant scalar field perturbations in an analytic inflationary model that transitions from slow roll to an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase. We find that the numerical solution of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation is well described by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) theory, as long as the appropriate branches of the Hamilton-Jacobi solutions are invoked: Modes that exit the horizon during the slow roll phase evolve into the USR as described by the first HJ branch, up to a subdominant $\mathcal{O}(k^2/H^2)$ correction to the Hamilton-Jacobi prediction for their final amplitude that we compute, indicating the influence of neglected gradient terms. Modes that exit during the USR phase are described by a separate HJ branch (very close to de Sitter) once they become sufficiently superhorizon, obtained by the shift $\epsilon_2 \rightarrow \tilde{\epsilon}_2\simeq \epsilon_2+6$. This transition is similar to the conveyor belt concept put forward in our previous work [1] and the intuition deriving from it. We further discuss implications for the validity of the stochastic equations arising from the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We conclude that if appropriately used, the Hamilton-Jacobi attractors can describe the dynamics of long wavelength inflationary inhomogeneities beyond slow roll.",
New submissions,Periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime,"Akihito Katsumata,Tomohiro Harada",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We study the periapsis shift of timelike bound orbits in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, which is an exact, static, axisymmetric, and vacuum solution characterized by the deformation parameter $\gamma$, including the Schwarzschild spacetime as $\gamma=1$. We derive both the exact formula for the periapsis shift of a quasi-circular orbit and the formula for the periapsis shift by the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion. We show that the periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime for $1/11 < \gamma \leq 1/5$ is the same as in the Schwarzschild spacetime to the 2PN order if $e=\sqrt{(\gamma^{-1}-5)/6}$, where $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit. Furthermore, we show that the parameter $\gamma$ and the corresponding quadrupole moment $\tilde{M}_2$ of the supermassive compact object at Sagittarius A* are constrained to $\gamma \gtrsim 1.7 \times 10^{-2}$ and $\tilde{M}_2 \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^3$, respectively, from observational data on S2 using the obtained PN expansion formula. Finally, we derive a new series representation for the periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime using a recently proposed prescription, which shows fast convergence not only in the weak-field regime but also for small eccentricity.",

Woodard",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),This paper is a sequel in which we derive and simplify the gravitational equations that apply in accelerating cosmological spacetimes.

New submissions,"Optimal Detection Bands for Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Binaries: Prospects for LISA and AMIGO in General Relativity and $f(R, T)$ Gravity","Marcelo M. Lapola,Oswaldo D. Miranda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a semi analytic forecast for the detection of intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) binaries with the space based detectors LISA (millihertz band) and AMIGO (deci hertz band). A redshift dependent population model is built from extrapolated black hole mass functions and realistic pairing and merger time scales. Folding this population through the instrument sensitivities yields event rates of about 1e4 mergers for LISA in four observing years and between 1e2 and 1e3 mergers for AMIGO in three years, with complementary optimal detection bands in total mass and redshift.We then incorporate the minimal matter coupled modified gravity model f(R,T) = R + 2 lambda T. In this scenario the strain amplitude is rescaled by (1 - lambda / 8 pi)^(5/6) while the waveform phasing is unchanged at leading order. For Solar System compatible couplings abs(lambda) <= 2 x 10^-3, the peak detection redshift shifts by less than one percent and the total number of events changes by less than five percent. Combined statistics from LISA and AMIGO therefore provide a consistency check on f(R,T) gravity without spoiling standard IMBH forecasts.",
New submissions,A multi-parameter expansion for the evolution of asymmetric binaries in astrophysical environments,"Sayak Datta,Andrea Maselli",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Compact binaries with large mass asymmetries - such as Extreme and Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals - are unique probes of the astrophysical environments in which they evolve. Their long-lived and intricate dynamics allow for precise inference of source properties, provided waveform models are accurate enough to capture the full complexity of their orbital evolution. In this work, we develop a multi-parameter formalism, inspired by vacuum perturbation theory, to model asymmetric binaries embedded in general matter distributions with both radial and tangential pressures. In the regime of small deviations from the Schwarzschild metric, relevant to most astrophysical scenarios, the system admits a simplified description, where both metric and fluid perturbations can be cast into wave equations closely related to those of the vacuum case. This framework offers a practical approach to modeling the dynamics and the gravitational wave emission from binaries in realistic matter distributions, and can be modularly integrated with existing results for vacuum sources.",
New submissions,Suppressed Intrinsic Curvature Gravity,"Ido Ben-Dayan,Elena Emtsova",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider various mechanisms of modifying the effect of intrinsic curvature in gravity with respect to general relativity. Two primary approaches are studied. First, by considering a Lagrange multiplier or an auxiliary field. Second, by non-minimal coupling between a scalar field and the intrinsic curvature scalar. We reproduce the basic solutions of FLRW cosmology, black hole solutions, Lense-Thirring effect, and gravitational waves. The speed of gravitational waves is modified in comparison to the speed of light. A certain limit of our theory corresponds to the lowest-order Carroll gravity. Hence, our theory is a different UV completion of Carroll gravity, compared to the usual expansion of a small speed of light. Carroll gravity limit also has an enhanced symmetry, making the reduced or vanishing extrinsic curvature technically natural. Although the intrinsic curvature and its modification may depend on the foliation, we use the covariant formalism and show that such a foliation always exists. Perhaps the most important outcome is that in the non-minimal coupling approach, the intrinsic curvature appearing in Einstein's field equations can defer from the one appearing in the geodesic equation potentially leading to important observational consequences.",
New submissions,Effective Equation of State Oscillations at Matter-Radiation Equality and Primordial Gravitational Waves,"S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The theory controlling the Universe's evolution in the classical regime has to be motivated by particle physics reasoning and should also generate inflation and dark energy eras in a unified way. One such framework is $F(R)$ gravity. In this work we examine a class of exponential deformations of $R^2$ gravity motivated by fundamental physics of scalaron evolution in a de Sitter background. As we show this class of models describe both inflation and the dark energy era in a viable way compatible with the Planck constraints on inflation and the cosmological parameters. Regarding the inflationary era, the exponentially deformed $R^2$ model also yields a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term which remarkably does not affect the dynamics and the inflationary evolution is identical to that of an $R^2$ model. The dark energy era is also found to be viable and mimics the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. More importantly, this class of $F(R)$ gravity exponential $R^2$ deformations also has an important characteristic, and specifically it yields total equation of state oscillations deeply in the matter domination era, for redshifts $z\sim 3400$, so near the matter-radiation equality. These total equation of state deformations at such a large redshift may directly affect the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. Indeed as we show, the effect is measurable and it leads to an enhancement of the tensor perturbations energy spectrum for low frequencies probed by the future LiteBIRD mission. This enhancement might have a measurable effect on the $B$-modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and thus may be detectable by the LiteBIRD mission. Only a handful of theoretical frameworks can generate the gravitational wave pattern generated by the class of exponentially deformed $R^2$ models we presented.",
New submissions,"Geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and infinite tidal forces","Xiaotian Zhang,Sijie Gao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We report some new findings regarding the subtle relations among geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and tidal forces. It is well known that any particle may be torn up near a singularity at the center of a black hole due to the divergent tidal force. However, we find that singularity is not the only cause of tidal force divergence. Even on the surface of the Earth, the tidal force experienced by a particle could be arbitrarily large if the particle moves arbitrarily close to the speed of light in a nonradial direction. Usually, a curvature singularity implies geodesic incompleteness since in many cases the metric cannot be defined at the location of the singularity. Counterexamples have been found in recent years, suggesting that geodesics could pass through curvature singularities. By taking into account the fact that any real particle is an extended body, we calculate the tidal force acting on the particle in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We explicitly show that an infinite tidal force always occurs near such a singularity. Therefore, no particle can actually reach the curvature singularity even if the metric is well defined at that point. We also show that the tidal acceleration along a null geodesic at the coordinate origin is divergent. For a wormhole solution that has a curvature singularity at the throat but possesses a regular metric, we show that the tidal force on any particle passing through the throat is divergent.",
New submissions,Improved Binary Black Hole Search Discriminator from the Singular Value Decomposition of Non-Gaussian Noise Transients,"Tathagata Ghosh,Sukanta Bose,Sanjeev Dhurandhar,Sunil Choudhary",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The sensitivity of current gravitational wave (GW) detectors to transient GW signals is severely affected by a variety of non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise transients, such as the blip and tomte ""glitches"". These glitches share some time-frequency resemblance with GW signals from massive binary black holes. In earlier works [Joshi et al., Phys. Rev. D 103, 044035 (2021); Choudhary et al., Phys. Rev. D 110, 044051 (2024)], the authors presented a method for constructing a $\chi^2$-distributed optimized statistic, based on the unified formalism of $\chi^2$ discriminators [Dhurandhar et al., Phys. Rev. D 96, 103018 (2017)], to distinguish the blip and tomte glitches from the compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals. Unlike past works, the new $\chi^2$ discriminator is constructed from the most significant singular vectors obtained from the singular-value decomposition (SVD) of glitches in real detector data. We find that the chi-square developed in this work performs as efficiently as in Choudhary et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, 044051 (2024)], which used sine-Gaussian basis vectors. This result supports past empirical findings that the blips and tomtes are well-modeled by sine-Gaussians. It also introduces a method for constructing signal- and glitch-based $\chi^2$ discriminators by directly using real data containing the glitches and, thus, holds promise for extensions to glitches that are captured less well by sine-Gaussians or other analytical functions.",
New submissions,Shadows of rotating black holes with parity-odd scalar hair,"Yang Huang,Dao-Jun Liu,Hongsheng Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Strong self-gravitational fields enable the realization of macroscopic odd-parity quantum objects. Using ray-tracing methods, we systematically analyze the shadow features of rotating black holes with parity-odd scalar hair and contrast them with those of Kerr black holes. Our results demonstrate measurable distinctions between scalar-haired black hole shadows and their Kerr counterparts. Notably, even for tiny scalar charge and negligible scalar hair mass contributions, these differences remain quantitatively resolvable. These findings provide critical theoretical benchmarks for future observational campaigns targeting scalar-field dark matter candidates through black hole shadow imaging.",
New submissions,Thermodynamic Topology of Black Holes within Tsallis Statistics,"Yahya Ladghami,Brahim Asfour,Amine Bouali,Ahmed Errahmani,Taoufik Ouali",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic topology of black holes within the framework of Tsallis statistics. By integrating Tsallis non-extensive statistics with topological thermodynamics, we analyze the local and global stability of various black hole solutions, including Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and higher-dimensional black holes. The introduction of Tsallis entropy, parameterized by the non-extensive parameter delta, results in distinct thermodynamic behaviors depending on its value. Employing Duan's phi-mapping theory, we classify the thermodynamic topology of four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes and non-charged higher-dimensional black holes into three distinct classes based on their topological number W: stable (W = +1), unstable (W = -1), and critical (W = 0). Additionally, the thermodynamic topology of Reissner-Nordstrom and charged higher-dimensional black holes is categorized into two classes, where W = +1 indicates a stable class and W = 0 represents a less stable class. Our study further demonstrates that the number of dimensions does not affect the topological thermodynamics within the context of non-extensive statistics. This approach provides novel insights into the interplay between Tsallis statistics and black hole thermodynamics, underscoring the pivotal role of topology in understanding black hole physics.",

New submissions,"Regular Magnetically Charged Black Holes from Nonlinear Electrodynamics: Thermodynamics, Light Deflection, and Orbital Dynamics","Ekrem Aydiner,Erdem Sucu,İzzet Sakallı",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the thermodynamic properties, light deflection, and orbital dynamics of regular magnetically charged black holes (NRCBHs) arising from nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) coupled to general relativity. The metric function $f(r)$ ensures complete regularity at the origin while maintaining asymptotic flatness, with the extremal magnetic charge limit reaching $q_{\text{ext}} \approx 2.54M$, significantly exceeding the Reissner-Nordström value. Using the quantum tunneling framework, we derive the Hawking temperature and incorporate generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrections, showing $T_{\text{GUP}} = (f'(r_h)/4\pi)\sqrt{1-2\beta m_p^2}$. The weak deflection of light is analyzed through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT), revealing charge-dependent behavior where large $q$ values lead to negative deflection angles due to electromagnetic repulsion. Plasma effects further modify the deflection through the refractive index $n(r) = \sqrt{1 - \omega_p^2(r)f(r)/\omega_0^2}$. Keplerian motion analysis demonstrates that the angular velocity $\Omega(r)$ exhibits charge-sensitive maxima related to quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accretion disks. Finally, we examine Joule-Thomson expansion (JTE) properties, finding that the coefficient $\mu_J$ indicates cooling behavior for higher charges and larger event horizons. Our results provide comprehensive insights into the observational signatures of NRCBHs, with implications for gravitational lensing, X-ray astronomy, and tests of nonlinear electromagnetic theories in strong gravitational fields.",
New submissions,Kerr black hole in a uniform magnetic field: An exact solution,"Jiri Podolsky,Hryhorii Ovcharenko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solution which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.",
New submissions,Interacting Scalar Fields as Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity,"Saddam Hussain,Simran Arora,Yamuna Rana,Benjamin Rose,Anzhong Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"A Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field $\phi$, responsible for the late-time cosmic acceleration and interacting with a coherent scalar field $\psi$ through an interaction potential $W(\phi,\psi)$, is considered from the point of view of particle physics for two different models. The non-minimal coupling between the GB curvature term and the field $\phi$ leads to a time-dependent speed of gravitational waves (GWs), which is fixed to unity in order to be consistent with current GW observations, rendering the GB coupling function model-independent. We investigate the dynamical stability of the system by formulating it in the form of an autonomous system, and constrain the model parameters using various sets of observational data. We find that both models are physically viable and closely follow the $\Lambda$CDM trend. We also use the updated Roman mock high redshift data to further constrain the parameters of the two models.",
New submissions,Hierarchical Subtraction with Neural Density Estimators as a General Solution to Overlapping Gravitational Wave Signals,Qian Hu,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Overlapping gravitational wave (GW) signals are expected in the third-generation (3G) GW detectors, leading to one of the major challenges in GW data analysis. Inference of overlapping GW sources is complicated - it has been reported that hierarchical inference with signal subtraction may amplify errors, while joint estimation, though more accurate, is computationally expensive. However, in this work, we show that hierarchical subtraction can achieve accurate results with a sufficient number of iterations, and on the other hand, neural density estimators, being able to generate posterior samples rapidly, make it possible to perform signal subtraction and inference repeatedly. We further develop likelihood-based resampling to accelerate the convergence of the iterative subtraction. Our method provides fast and accurate inference for overlapping GW signals and is highly adaptable to various source types and time separations, offering a potential general solution for overlapping GW signal analysis.",
New submissions,Evolution of Dark Energies and Compact Objects in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet Gravity induced Universe A Data Based Perspective,"Puja Mukherjee,Himanshu Chaudhary,Ujjal Debnath,G. Mustafa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmic evolution is the most sensational topic among researchers of modern cosmology. This article explores cosmic evolution in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity, focusing on mass accretion of compact objects (black holes and wormholes) by dark energy (DE). Three DE models Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP), and Barboza Alcaniz (BA) parameterizations are studied within 4D EGB gravity, with their Hubble parameters derived and compared against observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and CMB). Bayesian analysis favors the CPL and BA models, with CPL providing the best fit. For black holes, mass accretion of CPL and JBP DE shows transitions between quintessence and phantom eras, while BA and LambdaCDM strictly exhibit quintessence-like behavior, driving cosmic acceleration. In contrast, wormholes exhibit the opposite trend, favoring a phantom-dominated era for the BA and LambdaCDM models. The study highlights the dynamic nature of DE in 4D EGB gravity and its role in cosmic expansion.",
New submissions,Towards a consistent Semiclassical Theory of Gravity,Francisco Pipa,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We argue that semiclassical gravity can be rendered consistent by assuming that quantum systems only emit a gravitational field when they interact with a stable determination chain (SDCs), which are specific chains of interactions modeled via decoherence and test functions obeying a set of conditions. When systems are disconnected from SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field. This denies the universality of gravity, while upholding a version of the equivalence principle. We argue that this theory can be tested by experiments that investigate the gravitational field emitted by isolated systems like in gravcats experiments or by investigating the gravitational interactions between entangled systems like in the (Bose-Marletto-Vedral) BMV experiment. Our theory fits into a new framework which holds that in the absence of certain conditions, quantum systems cannot emit a gravitational field. There are many possible conditions for systems to emit a gravitational field, and we will adopt a subset of them. We will show how this subset of conditions provides multiple benefits beyond rendering semiclassical gravity consistent, which includes deriving the value of the cosmological constant from first principles and providing an explanation for why the vacuum does not gravitate.",
Cross submissions,Twisted echoes of an odd quartet: Scalar-induced gravitational waves as a probe of primordial parity-violation,"H. V. Ragavendra,Nicola Bartolo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Parity-violation leaves tell-tale trails in many cosmological observables. We illustrate parity-odd primordial scalar trispectra, that despite being of modest strength, impart detectable chirality to scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). This allows us to impose strong bounds on the parity-odd part of trispectrum. Over certain scales, we find SIGW directly quantify parity-violation in primordial non-Gaussianity, unobscured by the Gaussian contribution. Our results call for treatment of SIGW and parity-odd trispectrum as complementary predictions of parity-violating theories.",
Cross submissions,Evolving Dark Sector and the Dark Dimension Scenario,"Alek Bedroya,Georges Obied,Cumrun Vafa,David H. Wu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the KK graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w<-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. Regardless of the SN dataset, there is a preference for non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$ that are in the expected $O(1)$ range in Planck units as suggested by the Swampland criteria. In particular, there is a remarkable consistency with $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ for all dataset combinations including SN, and close to the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.",
Cross submissions,An Open System Approach to Gravity,"Santiago Agüí Salcedo,Thomas Colas,Lennard Dufner,Enrico Pajer",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Several major open problems in cosmology, including the nature of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, share a common structure: they involve spacetime-filling media with unknown microphysics, and can be probed so far only through their gravitational effects. This observation motivates a systematic open-system approach to cosmology, in which gravity evolves in the presence of a generic, unobservable environment. In this work, we develop a general framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial constraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our path integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in perturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime.As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of gravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are non-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it to include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the most general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation. Remarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is dissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at higher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case. Our results pave the way to modeling dissipative effects in the late universe.",
Cross submissions,Inferring the neutron star equation of state with nuclear-physics informed semiparametric models,"Sunny Ng,Isaac Legred,Lami Suleiman,Philippe Landry,Lyla Traylor,Jocelyn Read",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star observations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to elucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant to the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter equation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS framework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in astrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian Process extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric framework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear theoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear saturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear saturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models with nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS explored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema, under the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence of heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\odot}$ can be supported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities. We then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile modeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our semiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a favored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\rho_{\rm nuc}) = 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\;km, and $M_{\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\odot}$ at the 90\% credible level.",
Cross submissions,Sharp lower bound for the charged Hawking mass in the electrostatic space,"Benedito Leandro,Guilherme Sabo",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),We prove sharp lower bounds for the charged Hawking mass of stable surfaces in electrostatic space-times in various contexts. An upper bound for the genus of stable surfaces in the electrostatic system is provided. We also study the positivity for the charged Hawking mass of a minimal surface with index one in the electrostatic space-times. A criterion for a CMC surface in the Reissner-Nordstrom deSitter space to be stable is presented.,
Cross submissions,Quantum Transparency of Near-extremal Black Holes,"Roberto Emparan,Stefano Trezzi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the scattering of electromagnetic and gravitational waves off a Reissner-Nordström black hole in the low-temperature regime where the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations. We find that the black hole is transparent to electromagnetic and gravitational radiation below a certain frequency threshold. This phenomenon arises because the angular momentum of the black hole is quantized, creating an energy gap between the spinless black hole state and the first excited spinning states. Radiation with angular momentum -- such as photons, gravitons, and partial waves of a massless scalar field, which we also study -- must supply enough energy to bridge this gap to be absorbed. Below this threshold, no absorption can occur, rendering the black hole transparent. For frequencies above the gap, the scarcity of black hole states continues to suppress the absorption cross-section relative to semiclassical predictions, making the black hole translucent rather than completely transparent. Notably, electromagnetic absorption is significantly stronger than gravitational absorption, beyond what differences in spin alone would suggest.",
Cross submissions,Bimetric gravity improves the fit to DESI BAO and eases the Hubble tension,"Marcus Högås,Edvard Mörtsell",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB + SNe Ia, but it exacerbates the Hubble tension. By comparison, bimetric gravity provides a modest improvement in fit quality, at the $1 \, \sigma$ level, but, by inferring $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.4 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, it partially eases the Hubble tension, from a $5 \,\sigma$ discrepancy to a $3.7 \, \sigma$ tension. Including locally calibrated SNe Ia brings the overall preference for the bimetric model over $\Lambda$CDM to the $2 \, \sigma$ level, comparable to that of the $w_0 w_a$CDM model when including the local SN Ia calibration.",
Cross submissions,Thermodynamics of analogue black holes in a non-Hermitian tight-binding model,"D.F. Munoz-Arboleda,M. Stålhammar,C. Morais Smith",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a non-Hermitian model with gain/loss and non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor hopping that emulates black-hole physics. The model describes a one-dimensional lattice with a smooth connection between regions with distinct hopping parameters. By mapping the system to an effective Schwarzschild metric in the Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinates, we find that the interface is analogue to a black-hole event horizon. We obtain emission rates for particles and antiparticles, the Hawking temperature, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the mass of the analogue black hole as a function of the interface sharpness and the system parameters. An experimental realization of the theoretical model is proposed, thus opening the way to the detection of elusive black-hole features.",
Cross submissions,Gauging the Schwarzian Action,"A. Pinzul,A. Stern,Chuang Xu",Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we promote the global $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry of the Schwarzian derivative to a local gauge symmetry. To achieve this, we develop a procedure that potentially can be generalized beyond the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ case: We first construct a composite field from the fundamental field and its derivative such that it transforms linearly under the group action. Then we write down its gauge-covariant extension and apply standard gauging techniques. Applying this to the fractional linear representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, we obtain the gauge-invariant analogue of the Schwarzian derivative as a bilinear invariant of covariant derivatives of the composite field. The framework enables a simple construction of Nöther charges associated with the original global symmetry. The gauge-invariant Schwarzian action introduces $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge potentials, allowing for locally invariant couplings to additional fields, such as fermions. While these potentials can be gauged away on topologically trivial domains, non-trivial topologies (e.g., $S^1$) lead to distinct topological sectors. We mention that in the context of two-dimensional gravity, these sectors could correspond to previously discussed quantized defects in the bulk theory.",
Cross submissions,Self-Tracking Solutions for Asymptotic Scalar Fields,"Martin Mosny,Joseph P. Conlon,Edmund J. Copeland",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore the dynamics of pure scalar fields rolling on an exponential potential in the absence of any additional background fluid and demonstrate the existence of self-tracking solutions in which the self-perturbations of the scalar field act as an effective radiation background. The validity of these solutions is demonstrated through both analytic techniques and numerical simulations using CosmoLattice. We discuss applications to string cosmologies with significant trans-Planckian field excursions between inflation and BBN, including the required initial level of scalar perturbations to avoid overshoot.",
Cross submissions,Superrotations are Linkages,"Ratindranath Akhoury,Arielle Schutz,David Garfinkle",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that superrotations can be described using the geometric conformal completion method of Penrose. In particular, superrotation charges can be described and calculated using the linkage method of Geroch and Winicour.Whether superrotation charges are calculated using the coordinate based Bondi formalism or the geometric Penrose formalism, the fact that the superrotation blows up at a point makes the superrotation charge formally ill defined. Nonetheless, we show that it can be made well defined through a regularization procedure devised by Flanagan and Nichols.",
