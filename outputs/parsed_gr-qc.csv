New submissions,Slowly Rotating Relativistic Stars: VII. Gravitational Radiation from the Quasi-Radial Modes,"James B. Hartle(1),Kip S. Thorne(2) ((1) University of California Santa Barbara, (2) California Institute of Technology)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"When a relativistic star rotates slowly and rigidly, centrifugal forces flatten it slightly, thereby catalyzing a small admixture of quadrupolar vibration into its radial modes and a damping of the resulting quasi-radial modes. The damping rate $1/\tau$ of each quasi-radial mode divided by its frequency $\sigma^{(0)}$ is given by ${(1/\tau) / \sigma^{(0)} }= \beta (\sigma^{(0)})^3 \Omega^4 R^8/M \;, $where $\Omega$, $R$ and $M$ are the angular velocity, radius and mass of the star, and $\beta$ is a dimensionless number that depends on the mode, on relativistic corrections, and on the structure of the star, and is typically of order unity for the fundamental quasi-radial mode in the nonrelativistic limit. In this paper we develop equations and an algorithm for computing the emitted waves and the resulting damping factor $\beta$. The rotation is treated to second-order in the angular velocity and the pulsation amplitudes are assumed small and linearized, but no other approximations are made.",
New submissions,Handling Data Gaps for the Next Generation of Gravitational-Wave Observatories,"Noah Pearson,Neil J. Cornish",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the coming decades, as the low frequency sensitivity of detectors improves, the time that gravitational-wave signals remain in the sensitive band will increase, leading to new challenges in analyzing data, namely non-stationary noise and data gaps. Time-frequency (wavelet) methods can efficiently handle non-stationary noise, but data gaps still lead to spectral leakage due to the finite length of the wavelet filters. It was previously shown that Bayesian data augmentation - ""gap filling"" - could mitigate spectral leakage in frequency domain analyses, but the computational cost associated with the matrix operations needed in that approach is prohibitive. Here we present a new, computationally efficient approach to Bayesian data augmentation in the time-frequency domain that avoids repeated, costly matrix operations. We show that our approach efficiently solves the problem of data gaps in simulated LISA data, and can be smoothly integrated into the LISA Global Fit. The same approach can also be used for future 3G ground-based interferometers.",
New submissions,The effects of the Gravitational Field on the Efimov State,Yixuan Feng,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We successfully reproduced the derivation of Efimov energy levels in three-dimensional space. In subsequent discussions, we extended this derivation to Schwarzschild spacetime. By combining the Schrödinger equation in curved spacetime, we obtained the corrections to the Efimov energy spectrum under weak gravitational fields. Furthermore, using Riemann normal coordinate expansions, we rigorously derived the hyperradial equation in the presence of strong gravitational fields and applied first-order perturbation theory to compute the internal energy corrections of the Efimov system under strong-field conditions. We further propose a potential experimental approach to validate the theory by simulating spacetime curvature effects induced by gravity through the use of ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices under laboratory conditions.",
New submissions,Quantum-Gravitational Backreaction in BTZ via Curved Momentum Space,"Partha Nandi,Mainak Roy,Langa Horoto,Frederik G. Scholtz,Biswajit Chakraborty",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study how quantum features of spacetime, specifically the curvature of momentum space, can backreact on classical gravity in a semiclassical (2+1)D setting with a negative cosmological constant. Starting from a first-order action, we derive an effective configuration-space action, revealing mass-dependent geodesics and a mild violation of the equivalence principle. Coupling this modified matter source to Einstein gravity, we obtain a corrected BTZ black hole, with ADM mass, Hawking temperature, and entropy acquiring explicit corrections and upper bounds dictated by the momentum-space geometry. We also compute the return time of a massless particle along null geodesics, illustrating observable signatures of underlying quantum-spacetime structures. Our results provide a concrete semiclassical framework showing how Planck-scale kinematic modifications leave imprints on classical geometry.",
New submissions,Spherical Accretion on a Schwarzschild-MOG Black Hole,"Ayyesha K. Ahmed,M Z A Moughal",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper we have examined spherical accretion onto Schwarzschild MOG Black Holes within the framework of Modified Gravity. Using isothermal test fluids, we analyze the behavior of the flow near the critical (sonic) point for various values of the equation of state parameter $k$. Depending on the fluid type, the flow exhibits either subsonic or supersonic behavior, with ultra-stiff and ultra-relativistic fluids allowing both regimes, while radiation and sub-relativistic fluids show more restricted dynamics. Phase space analysis helps visualize these transitions. We also compute the mass accretion rate and find that it increases with both radial distance and the MOG parameter $\alpha$, highlighting the role of modified gravity in enhancing accretion processes around black holes",
New submissions,On the uniqueness of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes,Allen Juntao Fang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"In this paper, we prove a series of results concerning the uniqueness of Kerr-de Sitter as a family of smooth stationary black hole solutions to the nonlinear Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The results only assume smoothness rather than analyticity of the solution in question. The results use a two-sided approach to rigidity, requiring assumptions on both the event horizon and the cosmological horizon (or a neighborhood thereof) to formulate an appropriate unique continuation argument to prove the rigidity of Kerr-de Sitter.",
New submissions,Probing Horndeski Gravity via Kerr Black Hole: Insights from Thin Accretion Disks and Shadows with EHT Observations,"Xiao-Xiong Zeng,Chen-Yu Yang,M. Israr Aslam,Rabia Saleem",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we have considered the Kerr-like black hole (BH) model in Horndeski gravity and analyse the visual characteristics of shadow images under two illumination models, such as a celestial light source and a thin accretion disk. To capture the BH shadow images, we utilise a recent fisheye camera model and ray-tracing procedures. In this view, we carefully addressed the influence of the spin parameter $a$ and the hair parameter $h$ on the BH shadow images. The results indicate that for smaller values of $h$, the BH shadow contours shift noticeably towards the right side of the screen, while for larger values of $h$, the nearly circular shadow gradually deforms into a ``D'' shape profile. For a celestial light source, the larger values of $h$ lead to a reduction in the corresponding radius of the photon ring, while the space-dragging effect becomes more pronounced with increasing $a$. We further discuss the distinctive characteristics of images observed in both prograde and retrograde accretion disk scenarios. The results reveal that variations in $h$ significantly affect both the inner shadow and the resulting Einstein ring. Subsequently, we also discussed the distinct features of red-shift configurations on the disk for both direct and lensed images, which are closely related to the accretion flow and the relevant parameters. We also attempt to use the recent observational data from M$87^{\ast}$ and Sgr $A^{\ast}$ and constrain the hair parameter $h$, confirming the validity of Horndeski gravity.",
New submissions,Lovelock type brane cosmology,"Amairani Arroyo,Rubén Cordero,Giovany Cruz,Efraín Rojas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The cosmological implications of the geodetic brane gravity model, enhanced by geometrical terms of Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) type and Gibbons-Hawking-York-Myers type (GHYM), carefully constructed as combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures, are examined. All the geometrical terms under study belong to a set named Lovelock-type brane models. The combined model gives rise to a second-order differential equation of motion. Under a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry defined on a $(3+1)$-dimensional world volume, together with a perfect fluid matter content, the emerging universe of this model evolves in a 5-dimensional Minkowski background, yielding peculiar facts. The resulting Friedmann-type equation is written in terms of energy density parameters, where fine-tuning is needed to probe interesting cosmological processes close to the current data. In this sense, Lovelock-type brane models might underlie the cosmic acceleration. Indeed, we find that these correction terms become significant at low energies/late times. The model exhibits self-accelerating (non-self-accelerating) behavior for the brane expansion, and in the case where the radiation-like contribution due to the existence of the extra dimension vanishes its behavior is the same as the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) brane cosmology and its generalization to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) brane gravity. Likewise, Einstein cosmology is recovered when the radiation-like contribution fades away along with the odd polynomials in brane extrinsic curvature.",
New submissions,Equality of ADM mass and generalized Komar energy in asymptotically-flat dynamical spacetimes,"Zhi-Wei Wang,Samuel L. Braunstein",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"We find a relation between the ADM mass and a generalized Komar energy in asymptotically-flat spacetime. We do not need to assume the existence of either a Killing or even asymptotically-Killing vector field. Instead, our generalized Komar energy is constructed from the normal evolution vector (the lapse function times the future-directed unit normal to the spacelike hypersurfaces on which the ADM mass is measured). We find equality between the ADM mass and this generalized Komar energy even for dynamical asymptotically-flat spacetimes provided the 3-dimensional Einstein tensor drops off quickly enough at spatial infinity, in particular, whenever ${}^{(3)}G_{ij}=o(r^{-3})$. No additional assumptions are required for equality. As this generalized energy is fully covariant, it may provide a powerful tool for analyzing energy content in dynamical spacetimes containing compact objects.",
New submissions,Expansion-sensitive coupling of a local quantum system in de Sitter cosmology,"Jorma Louko,Guillermo A. Mena Marugán,Alvaro Torres-Caballeros",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"When a local quantum system couples to a quantum field in a cosmological spacetime, the time dependence of the coupling strength is conventionally taken to reflect the design of the local quantum system but not to depend on the large-scale structure of the universe. In this paper, we consider a novel coupling that incorporates additional time dependence that reflects the cosmological expansion, as motivated by structures that appear in quantum cosmology. We focus on a conformal scalar field in a de Sitter Friedmann-Lema\^ıtre-Robertson-Walker cosmology with flat but compact spatial sections in 3+1 dimensions, and a comoving Unruh-DeWitt detector: the novel coupling posits the detector to couple to the scaled scalar field that appears in the conformally related static spacetime. We survey the differences between the conventional and novel coupling, for detectors that couple to the full field and detectors that couple only to specific field modes, and for detectors with proper time internal dynamics and detectors with conformal time internal dynamics. We also briefly discuss noncompact spatial sections and single-mode detectors with discontinuous time dependence. We find that the novel coupling tends to enhance the de-excitation peaks in the detector's response, particularly for single-mode detectors.",
New submissions,Quasi-dust ekpyrotic scenario in Loop Quantum Cosmology,"Emmanuel Frion,Mateo Pascual,Francesca Vidotto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we study a cosmological bouncing model with two fields that reproduce the desired features of the primordial power spectra. The model combines the matter-bounce mechanism, that generates scale-invariant perturbations, with ekpyrotic contraction, that suppresses anisotropies leading to the bounce. The bounce that replaces the classical initial singularity is achieved thanks to the loop quantisation. The matter-bounce is enacted by a \textit{quasi-dust} scalar field, with a slightly-negative equation of state that accounts for a small positive cosmological constant, that generates a red-tilt in the perturbations' power spectra. A second field, endowed with an ekpyrotic potential, is introduced to tame the growth of anisotropies throughout the bouncing phase. The equations of motion of the scalar perturbations are non-trivially coupled, leading to rich phenomenology that cannot be inferred simply from their single-field counterpart. We study the evolution of scalar and tensor perturbations and compare the results to current observations, showing the viability of this model as a base for further investigations.",
New submissions,Hamiltonian gravity in tetrad-connection variables,Erick I. Duque,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A systematic Hamiltonian formulation of the Einstein--Cartan system, based on the Hilbert--Palatini action with the Barbero--Immirzi and cosmological constants, is performed using the traditional ADM decomposition and without fixing the time gauge. This procedure results in a larger phase space compared to that of the Ashtekar--Barbero approach as well as a larger set of first-class constraints generating gauge transformations that are on-shell equivalent to spacetime diffeomorphisms and SO(1,3) transformations. The imbalance in the number of components between the tetrad and the connection is resolved by the identification of second-class constraints implied by the action, which can be implemented by use of Dirac brackets or by solving them directly. The Hamiltonian system remains well-defined off the second-class constraint surface in an extended phase space with additional degrees of freedom, implying a more general geometric theory. Implications for canonical quantum gravity are discussed.",
New submissions,Shear viscosity to entropy density ratio: A powerful tool for gravity theories and strongly coupled fluids,"Marilù Chiofalo,Dario Grasso,Stefano Liberati,Massimo Mannarelli",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this perspective review, we present a concise yet multifaceted overview of the pivotal role played by the the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio across various physical contexts. After summarizing some of the main aspects of the bound obtained by Kovtun, Son and Starinets, we examine potential sources of its violation, exploring the insights these may offer and their connections to fundamental causality conditions. We also review a range of experimental tests conducted in diverse, yet complementary, physical systems, discussing the prospects opened by upcoming measurements.",
New submissions,Shadow Formation Conditions Beyond the Kerr Black Hole Paradigm,"Parth Bambhaniya,Saurabh,Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"A compact object illuminated by background radiation produces a dark silhouette. The edge of the silhouette or shadow (alternatively, the apparent boundary or the critical curve) is commonly determined by the presence of the photon sphere (or photon shell in the case of rotating spacetime), corresponding to the maximum of the effective potential for null geodesics. While this statement stands true for Kerr black holes, here we remark that the apparent boundary (as defined by Bardeen) forms under a more general condition. We demonstrate that a shadow forms if the effective potential of null geodesics has a positive finite upper bound and includes a region where photons are trapped or scattered. Our framework extends beyond conventional solutions, including but not limited to naked singularities. Furthermore, we clarify the difference between the apparent boundary of a dark shadow and the bright ring on the screen of a distant observer. These results provide a unified theoretical basis for interpreting observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and guiding future efforts towards extreme-resolution observations of compact objects.",
New submissions,Rectifying Power-law $F(R)$ Gravity and Starobinsky Inflation Deformations in View of ACT,"S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we aim to provide a consistent theoretical framework that revives the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation framework in the Jordan frame. It is known in the literature that the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation of the form $F(R)=R+\beta R^n$ is non-viable and produces a power-law evolution. We demonstrate that the standard approach in power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation is flawed for many reasons and we introduce a new framework which elevates the role of power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation, making it viable and compatible with both the Planck and ACT data. In our framework the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation is disentangled from a power-law evolution.",
New submissions,Resonance in black hole ringdown: Benchmarking quasinormal mode excitation and extraction,"Kei-ichiro Kubota,Hayato Motohashi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate how resonant excitation near exceptional points manifests in Kerr black hole ringdown waveforms and examine its extraction. Using waveforms generated by localized initial data, where quasinormal mode amplitudes are given solely by excitation factors, we establish a controlled benchmark for overtone extraction. Applying an iterative fitting method with mirror modes, we analyze a mild resonance in the $(l,m)=(2,2)$ multipole and a sharp resonance in the $(3,1)$ multipole occurring as part of a sequence of successive resonances. For $(2,2)$, we extract the fundamental mode, the first three overtones, and the fundamental mirror mode with relative errors below $10\%$, and show that residual waveforms exhibit the expected damped sinusoids together with distinctive resonance signatures. For $(3,1)$, we demonstrate that resonances can not only amplify but also reduce QNM excitations, reshaping the overtone hierarchy and rendering the sharp resonance more pronounced in ringdown. Our results clarify the imprint of resonance in Kerr ringdown and highlight both the robustness and limitations of current extraction techniques, providing a foundation for more reliable extraction of higher overtones and for applications to observational data analysis.",
New submissions,Learning to detect continuous gravitational waves: an open data-analysis competition,"Rodrigo Tenorio,Michael J. Williams,Joseph Bayley,Christopher Messenger,Maggie Demkin,Walter Reade,Kaggle Competitors","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open data-science platform Kaggle, to detect simulated continuous gravitational-wave signals. These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude at a 2% dismissal probability. Additionally, the competition drove the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines and extended CW-inspired statistics to other domains. We release the associated dataset, which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments toward the first detection of these elusive signals.",
New submissions,Effective one-body theory of spinless binary evolution dynamics,"Jiliang Jing,Sheng Long,Weike Deng,Jieci Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The effective one-body (EOB) theory provides an innovative framework for analyzing the dynamics of binary systems, as articulated by Hamilton's equations. This paper investigates a self-consistent EOB theory specifically tailored for the dynamics of such systems. Our methodology begins by emphasizing how to effectively utilize the metrics derived from scattering angles in the analysis of binary black hole mergers. We then construct an effective Hamiltonian and formulate a decoupled, variable-separated Teukolsky-like equation for $\psi^B_4$. Furthermore, we present the formal solution to this equation, detailing the energy flux, radiation-reaction force (RRF), and waveforms for the ``plus"" and ``cross"" modes generated by spinless binaries. Finally, we carry out numerical calculations using the EOB theory and compare the results with numerical relativity (NR) data from the SXS collaboration. The results indicate that to the innermost stable circular orbit, the binding energy -- angular momentum relation differs from the NR results by less than $5$\textperthousand, with a larger mass ratio yielding better agreement.",
New submissions,Leveraging the null stream to detect strongly lensed gravitational waves,"Jef Heynen,Soumen Roy,Justin Janquart",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves is expected to be observed in current and future detectors. In view of the growing number of detections, computationally light pipelines are needed. Detection pipelines used in past LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA searches for strong lensing require parameter estimation to be performed on the gravitational wave signal or are machine learning based. Removing the need for parameter estimation in classical methods would alleviate the ever growing demand of computational resources in strong lensing searches and would make real-time analysis possible. We present a novel way of identifying strongly lensed gravitational wave signals, based on the null stream of a detector network. We lay out the basis for this detection method and show preliminary results confirming the validity of the formalism. We also discuss the next development steps, including how to make it independent of parameter estimation.",
New submissions,Elliptic curvature estimates for linearised gravitational perturbations of Kerr in the full sub-extremal range $|a|<M$,"Gabriele Benomio,Rita Teixeira da Costa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG),We consider the linearised vacuum Einstein equations around a Kerr exterior solution and present a scheme to prove elliptic $L^2(\mathbb{S}^2)$-estimates for the linearised curvature quantities in the equations. The scheme employs the linearised system of equations derived in the first author's doctoral thesis and applies to the full sub-extremal range of Kerr parameters $0\leq |a|<M$.,
New submissions,Machine Learning Assisted Parameter-Space Searches for Lensed Gravitational Waves,"Giulia Campailla,Marco Raveri,Wayne Hu,Jose María Ezquiaga",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"When a gravitational wave encounters a massive object along the line of sight, repeated copies of the original signal may be produced due to gravitational lensing. In this paper, we develop a series of new machine-learning based statistical methods to identify promising strong lensing candidates in gravitational wave catalogs. We employ state-of-the-art normalizing flow generative models to perform statistical calculations on the posterior distributions of gravitational wave events that would otherwise be computationally unfeasible. Our lensing identification strategy, developed on two simulated gravitational wave catalogs that test noise realization and event signal variations, selects event pairs with low parameter differences in the optimal detector basis that also have a high information content and favorable likelihood for coincident parameters. We then apply our method to the GWTC-3 catalog and find a single pair still consistent with the lensing hypothesis. This pair has been previously identified through more costly evidence ratio techniques, but rejected on astrophysical grounds, which further validates our technique.",
Cross submissions,Extending the Dynamical Systems Toolkit: Coupled Fields in Multiscalar Dark Energy,"Daniele Licciardello,Saba Rahimy,Ivonne Zavala",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the dynamics of a two-field scalar model consisting of an axion-saxion pair with both kinetic and potential couplings, as motivated by string theory compactifications. We extend the dynamical systems (DS) toolkit by introducing a new set of variables that not only close the system and enable a systematic stability analysis, but also disentangle the role of the kinetic coupling. Within this framework we derive a compact, general expression for the non-geodesicity (turning-rate) parameter evaluated at fixed points, valid for arbitrary couplings. This provides a transparent way of diagnosing non-geodesic dynamics, with direct applications to both dark energy and multifield inflation. We first consider exponential coupling functions to establish analytic control and facilitate comparison with previous literature. In this case, we uncover a pair of genuinely non-geodesic fixed points, which act as attractors within a submanifold of the full system. In contrast, when the axion shift symmetry remains unbroken, our analysis shows that the apparent non-geodesic fixed point reported previously does not persist once the full dynamics are taken into account. Finally, we illustrate how our approach naturally extends to more realistic string-inspired models, such as power-law axion potentials combined with exponential saxion couplings, and present an explicit supergravity realisation.",
Cross submissions,"Gravitational Hilbert spaces: invariant and co-invariant states, inner products, gauge-fixing, and BRST","Jesse Held,Henry Maxfield",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Hilbert spaces in theories of gravity are notoriously subtle due to the Hamiltonian constraints, particularly regarding the inner product. To demystify this subject, we review and extend a collection of ideas in canonical gravity, and connect to the sum-over-histories approach by clarifying the Hilbert space interpretation of various gravitational path integrals. We use one-dimensional (or mini-superspace) models as the simplest context to exemplify the conceptual ideas. We emphasise that a physical Hilbert space can be defined either by requiring states to be annihilated by constraint operators (e.g., the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) or by equivalence relations between wavefunctions, and explain that these two approaches are related by an inner product. We advocate that the group averaging procedure constructs the correct physical inner product. The Klein-Gordon inner product is not positive-definite, which we explain as arising from a bad gauge choice; nonetheless, it agrees with group averaging when such a problem is absent. These concepts are all embedded in the BRST/BFV formalism, which provides a systematic way to construct these and other physically equivalent inner products (e.g., from maximal-volume gauge and Gaussian averaged gauges). Finally we discuss the application of these ideas in the semi-classical approximation, including non-perturbative gravitational effects.",
Cross submissions,The Making of von Neumann Algebras from Bulk Focusing,"Netta Engelhardt,Hong Liu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The single-trace, infinite-N algebra of an arbitrary region may or may not be a von Neumann algebra depending on the GNS sector. In this paper we identify the holographic dual of this mechanism as a consequence of the focusing of null geodesics; more precisely, this GNS sector-dependence corresponds to the well-known difference between null congruences fired from the bulk and those fired from the boundary. As part of establishing this property, we give a rigorous formulation and proof of causal wedge reconstruction for those general boundary subregions whose single trace algebras support von Neumann algebras at large-N. We discuss a possible finite-N extension and interpretation of our results as an explanation for the Hawking area theorem.",
Cross submissions,Entanglement Entropy and Thermodynamics of Dynamical Black Holes,"Weizhen Jia,Qiongyu Qi,Christina Gao",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore the thermodynamic and entanglement properties of dynamical black holes based on the recently proposed dynamical black hole entropy by Hollands-Wald-Zhang. We first provide a direct proof that, under first order perturbations, the dynamical black hole entropy in any $f(R)$ theory equals the Wald entropy evaluated on the generalized apparent horizon. Then, we compute the gravitational entanglement entropy explicitly using both the event horizon and the apparent horizon as the entangling surfaces, and show that only the apparent horizon prescription reproduces the correct dynamical black hole entropy satisfying the physical process first law. Furthermore, we reinterpret the generalized second law by identifying the modified von Neumann entropy as the matter entanglement across the (generalized) apparent horizon. This allows us to express the total entropy as the renormalized generalized entropy evaluated on this surface for both Einstein's gravity and $f(R)$ gravity.",
Cross submissions,The 21 cm forest one-dimensional power spectrum as a probe of dark matter particles and primordial black holes,"Meng-Lin Zhao,Yue Shao,Sai Wang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena primarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other late-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a novel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM properties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing the gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method for constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the early universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this work, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that astrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes. Under low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could constrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim {10^{-31}}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim {10^{30}}\,{\rm s}$ for ${10}\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with masses $\sim {10^{15}}\,{\rm\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude over current limits. Furthermore, the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum has the potential to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe PBHs with masses above $10^{18}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.",
Cross submissions,Emergence of Unruh prethermalization for uniformly accelerating many-atom system,"Saptarshi Saha,Chiranjeeb Singha,Pragna Das,Arpan Chatterjee",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A uniformly accelerated atom in an inertial vacuum generally thermalizes and reaches a Gibbs state. This phenomenon is commonly known as the Unruh effect. Here, we show that the situation is entirely different for the many-atoms problem. In the case of non-interacting accelerating atoms, we show that a regime exists where the entire system reaches a prethermal generalized Gibbs state before it thermalizes. The prethermal state is protected by emergent conserved quantities; hence, the system behaves like a nearly-integrable one, which shows a sharp distinction from the Unruh effect. We coin the term ``Unruh prethermalization"" to characterize this phenomenon. The measure of entanglement is a good estimation of the lifetime of the prethermal state and is consistent with previous studies. Finally, we show that in such a regime, the dynamics show a Dicke superradiance-type radiation burst before reaching the prethermal state. In contrast, only a mono-exponential decay is observed for Unruh thermalization. In addition, to highlight the significance of our results, we compare them with existing experimental observations.",
Cross submissions,What is the most massive gravitational-wave source?,Ilya Mandel,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, the events which appear to be the most extreme are very likely to be those exhibiting the greatest statistical fluctuations. It is therefore particularly important to exercise care when interpreting such events and to use the entire observed population for context. Here, I attempt to pedagogically illustrate this using the example of the most massive binary black hole so far detected in gravitational-wave data, GW231123. I argue that its total mass may be significantly lower than $238^{+28}_{-49}$ solar masses as reported by Abac et al. (2025a). The maximum total binary black hole mass from an analysis of the entire detected population may well be less than 140 solar masses, but the value is very sensitive to assumptions about the population distribution.",
Cross submissions,Solar--System Experiments in the Search for Dark Energy and Dark Matter,Slava G. Turyshev,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We reassess the realistic discovery reach of Solar--System experiments for dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) and quantify their complementarity to dedicated cosmological probes, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid mission. In scalar-tensor frameworks with universal conformal coupling $A(\phi)$, screening (chameleon/symmetron, Vainshtein) suppresses fifth forces in deep Solar potentials, consistent with the gravitational-wave speed bound $|c_{\tt T}/c-1|\lesssim 10^{-15}$. We treat Solar--System tests as hypothesis-driven probes: we assemble quantitative guardrails (MICROSCOPE $\eta$, Cassini $\gamma$, LLR $\dot G/G$ and SEP, ephemeris limits on $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and Yukawa $\alpha(\lambda)$, and clock-network searches for ultralight DM), place them alongside current cosmology posteriors, and provide an explicit map from cosmology-level linear response (e.g., $\mu_{\rm lin,0}$) to local residuals using the screening relations (thin--shell and Vainshtein). Guided by systematics-gated criteria, we outline a near-term program -- solar-conjunction Shapiro-delay and Doppler/range tests, sustained millimeter-class LLR, global optical-clock links, refined ephemerides, and spaceborne atom interferometry (AIS) -- with realistic sensitivities $|\gamma-1|\in (2$--$5)\times 10^{-6}$, $\eta_{\rm EEP}\sim10^{-16}$--$10^{-17}$ (AIS/LLR), $|\dot{G}/G|\lesssim (2$--$5)\times 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, a uniform $\simeq 2\times$ tightening of AU-scale Yukawa/DM-density bounds, and $3$--$10\times$ gains in ultralight-DM couplings from clock networks. Primary discovery potential for late-time dark energy lies with multi-probe cosmology (geometry and growth), while a hypothesis-driven Solar--System program supplies high-leverage falsification and selective discovery windows for dark matter with ultralight mediators or long-range forces.",
Cross submissions,Reassessing the Spin of Second-born Black Holes in Coalescing Binary Black Holes and Its Connection to the chi_eff-q Correlation,"Zi-Yuan Wang,Ying Qin,Rui-Chong Hu,Yuan-Zhu Wang,Georges Meynet,Han-Feng Song",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff of binary black hole mergers in GWTC-4.0 have been reported to display a weakeran ti-correlation compared to GWTC-3, a feature whose origin has been explored by several groups. In this work, within the isolated binary evolution framework, we adopt a recently proposed wind prescription for helium stars to systematically investigate the spin of the second-born black hole and its role in shaping this correlation. Using the stellar and binary evolution code MESA, which includes a recently proposed helium-star wind prescription alongside internal differential rotation and tidal interactions,we find that the recently proposed wind prescription for helium stars is substantially weaker than the standard Dutch wind scheme, particularly at subsolar metallicity. Using this scheme, we perform detailed binary modeling of a helium star with a black hole companion. Our results show that the spin magnitude of the resulting black hole is insensitive to the helium star's evolutionary stage at the onset of tidal interactions or to the companion mass. Instead, wind mass loss plays the dominant role: more massive helium-star progenitors produce lower-spinning black holes. The initial stellar rotation has only a minor effect, especially under strong tidal coupling, consistent with the common assumption of orbital synchronization. Using the derived relation between the mass and spin of the second-born black hole, we find that the properties of most binary black holes in GWTC-4.0-specifically the mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff-can be reproduced. We further show that the q-chi_eff correlation is sensitive to the assumed mass function (e.g., Gaussian and uniform distribution), displaying notable deviations from the Power-Law+Peak model.",
Cross submissions,Reduction of topological invariants on null hypersurfaces,"Jiang Long,Xin-Hao Zhou",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational helicity flux density represents the angular distribution of helicity flux in general relativity. In this work, we explore its relationship to the reduction of topological invariants at future null infinity. Contrary to initial expectations, the Pontryagin term, which contributes to the gravitational chiral anomaly, is not related to the gravitational helicity flux density. Instead, the Nieh-Yan term, another topological invariant within the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR), can reproduce this flux density. We also reduce these two topological invariants to null hypersurfaces describing near-horizon geometry. In this near-horizon context, the Pontryagin term yields a non-trivial quantity that may characterize a Carrollian fluid helicity relevant to near-horizon physics.",
Cross submissions,Equation of State Extrapolation Systematics: Parametric vs. Nonparametric Inference of Neutron Star Structure,Bhaskar Biswas,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"The equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter is a central open problem in nuclear astrophysics. Its inference is hindered by the lack of \textit{ab initio} control above about twice nuclear saturation density, requiring extrapolation. Parametric schemes such as piecewise polytropes (PP) are efficient but restrictive, while nonparametric approaches like Gaussian processes (GP) allow more flexibility at the cost of larger prior volumes. We extend our hybrid EOS framework by replacing the high-density polytropic extension with a GP representation of the squared sound speed, anchored at low densities by the SLy crust EOS and a nuclear meta-model constrained by $\chi$EFT and laboratory data. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we jointly constrain the EOS and neutron star mass distribution with multi-messenger observations, including NICER radii, GW170817 and GW190425 tidal deformabilities, pulsar masses, and neutron skin experiments. We examine four scenarios defined by high-density extrapolation (PP vs.\ GP) and hotspot geometry in the NICER modeling of PSR~J0030$+$0451 (ST+PDT vs.\ PDT-U). GP extrapolations generally yield softer EOS posteriors with broader uncertainties. Hotspot assumptions also play an important role, shifting inferred mass--radius relations. Bayesian evidence strongly favors the ST+PDT geometry over PDT-U under both extrapolations, while GP is mildly preferred over PP. These results underscore the impact of observational modeling and EOS extrapolation on neutron star inferences, and show that a GP-based extension offers a robust way to quantify systematic uncertainties in high-density matter.",
Cross submissions,Optimal robust detection statistics for pulsar timing arrays,"Rutger van Haasteren,Bruce Allen,Joseph D. Romano",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) seek to detect a nano-Hz stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) by searching for the characteristic Hellings and Downs angular pattern of timing residual correlations. So far, the evidence remains below the conventional $5$-$\sigma$ threshold, as assessed using the literature-standard ``optimal cross-correlation detection statistic''. While this quadratic combination of cross-correlated data maximizes the {\em deflection} (signal-to-noise ratio), it does not maximize the detection probability at fixed false-alarm probability (FAP), and therefore is not Neyman-Pearson (NP) optimal for the assumed noise and signal models. The NP-optimal detection statistic is a different quadratic form, but is not used because it also incorporates autocorrelations, making it more susceptible to uncertainties in the modeling of pulsar timing noise. Here, we derive the best compromise: a quadratic detection statistic which is as close as possible to the NP-optimal detection statistic (minimizing the variance of its difference with the NP statistic) subject to the constraint that it only uses cross-correlations, so that it is less affected by pulsar noise modeling errors. We study the performance of this new $\NPMV$ statistic for a simulated PTA whose noise and (putative) signal match those of the NANOGrav 15-year data release: GWB amplitude $A_{\rm gw}=2.1\times 10^{-15}$ and spectral index $\gamma=13/3$. Compared to the literature-standard ``optimal"" cross-correlation detection statistic, the $\NPMV$ statistic increases the detection probability by $47\%$ when operating at a $5$-$\sigma$ FAP of $\alpha = 2.9 \times 10^{-7}$.",
Cross submissions,Thermalization dynamics of finite-size quantum critical systems,"Li Li,Yan Liu,Hao-Tian Sun",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Using holographic duality, we investigate thermalization process when two finite-size quantum critical systems are brought into thermal contact along a perfectly transmitting interface. Through real-time simulations of gravitational dynamics, which are spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic and are confined within two dynamical bulk branes, we identify three distinct thermalization patterns governed by the energy imbalance (temperature difference) and system size. For systems with large size and small energy imbalance, we observe recurrent cycles of formation and collapse of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). Under large energy imbalance, shock waves persist for a prolonged period with sustained boundary reflections, while rarefaction waves rapidly homogenize. When the system size is sufficiently small, dissipation dominates and leads to oscillatory decay without sustained NESS or shock structure. In sharp contrast to diffusive systems, we uncover that wave-propagated energy transfer together with boundary reflections enables nearly complete energy swapping between subsystems during thermalization. Our results reveal rich thermalization dynamics in finite-size quantum critical systems across spatial scales and energy gradient regimes.",
Cross submissions,"Magnetic, thermal and rotational evolution of isolated neutron stars","José A. Pons,Clara Dehman,Daniele Viganò",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The strong magnetic fields of neutron stars are closely linked to their observed thermal, spectral, and timing properties, such as the distribution of spin periods and their derivatives. To understand the evolution of astrophysical observables over time, it is essential to develop robust theoretical frameworks and numerical models that solve the coupled thermal and magnetic field evolution equations, incorporating detailed microphysical inputs like thermal and electrical conductivities and neutrino emission rates. These efforts are key to uncovering how the strength and geometry of magnetic fields change with age, ultimately shedding light on the diverse phenomenology of neutron stars. In this review, we outline the fundamental theory underlying magneto-thermal evolution models, with an emphasis on numerical methods and a comprehensive set of benchmark tests intended to guide current and future code development. We revisit established results from axisymmetric simulations, highlight recent progress in fully three-dimensional models, and offer a perspective on the anticipated developments in this rapidly evolving field.",
Cross submissions,Heavy Field Effects on Inflationary Models in Light of ACT Data,"Shuntaro Aoki,Hajime Otsuka,Ryota Yanagita",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), when combined with Planck and DESI datasets, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ larger than that reported in the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby challenging conventional Starobinsky-type ($\alpha$-attractor) inflationary scenarios at the $2\sigma$ level. In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.",
Cross submissions,The Higgs Field Governs the Interior Spacetime of Black Holes,Itzhak Bars,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Higgs field is conventionally treated as a small local perturbation atop a large, constant vacuum value that uniformly permeates the universe. I propose instead that in regions of extreme gravitational intensity -- such as near gravitational singularities -- the Higgs field behaves in a profoundly non-perturbative manner. In such environments, spacetime and the Higgs field engage in a dynamic interplay that extends spacetime beyond the singularity, achieving geodesic completeness. The continuation beyond the singularity is dominated by antigravity effects, reshaping the causal structure of spacetime and enabling novel flows of matter and information, including traversal through singularities. In its standard form, the combined framework of the Standard Model (SM) and General Relativity (GR), as well as most of its extensions, fails to capture these phenomena due to its geodesic incompleteness. By contrast, a refined, locally conformal-symmetric formulation -- denoted i(SM+GR) -- naturally incorporates these effects. GR is not an optional component of i(SM+GR) but an essential ingredient. This framework preserves the empirical success of SM+GR in the low-energy regime while predicting striking new phenomena in extreme gravitational settings, including within black holes (on both sides of the singularity) and in pre--Big Bang cosmology. At the classical field theory level, i(SM+GR) offers fresh perspectives on the black hole information puzzle and provides a platform for locally scale-invariant generalizations, such as geodesically complete quantum field theory, string theory, and unified models of fundamental interactions. This paper presents the detailed derivations and explanations that underlie a condensed letter version recently published in [1].",
Cross submissions,Error Signals for Overcoming the Laser Power Limits of Gravitational-Wave Detection,"Liu Tao,Pooyan Goodarzi,Jonathan W. Richardson",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A major barrier to improving the quantum-limited sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories are the thermal distortions of the test masses which arise at megawatt laser power. Recent advances in a new form of higher-order wavefront correction, in which corrective heating profiles are applied to the test mass surfaces near their edges, have the potential to enable a tenfold reduction of the quantum noise floor of future detectors. However, realizing high levels of quantum noise reduction in practice hinges on identifying measurable error signals to finely control each wavefront actuator, in order to suppress wavefront errors to few-nanometer precision across the full mirror apertures. No direct source of such an error signal exists in LIGO today. We demonstrate that thermally imaging the surface of each test mass can provide these critical error signals. We show that the surface temperature profiles obtained from thermal imaging can be uniquely mapped to a finite element model of the mirror whose complete thermal state is identified, enabling full-aperture wavefront reconstruction and direct error signals for real-time precision wavefront control. This new sensing capability can enable up to a 34% strain sensitivity improvement in LIGO A+ at 95% confidence, increasing the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers by 11 Mpc, and will be integral to a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the U.S., Cosmic Explorer.",
Cross submissions,Renormalizable quantum field theory in curved spacetime with external two-form field,"Ioseph L. Buchbinder,Thomas M. Sangy,Ilya L. Shapiro",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We argue that the renormalizability of interacting quantum field theory on the curved-space background with an additional external antisymmetric tensor (two-form) field requires nonminimal interaction of the antisymmetric field with quantum fermions and scalars. The situation is qualitatively similar to the metric and torsion background. In both cases, one can explore the renormalization group running for the parameters of nonminimal interaction and see how this interaction behaves in the UV limit. General considerations are confirmed by the one-loop calculations in the well-known gauge model based on the $SU(2)$ gauge group.",
