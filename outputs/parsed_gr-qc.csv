New submissions,Probing Lorentz Symmetry Violation through Lensing Observables of Rotating Black Holes,"Arun Kumar,Shafqat Ul Islam,Sushant G. Ghosh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We find a Kerr-like black hole solution-a rotating Bumblebee black hole (RBBH) with a Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$ and examine the strong lensing by it. The parameter $\ell$ changes the event horizon radius and photon sphere, resulting in a different lensing signature compared to the Kerr black hole of general relativity. Using the strong deflection limit formalism, we compute key observables such as the angular positions of relativistic images, their separation, magnification, and time delays for supermassive black holes Sgr A* and M87*. Our results show that the parameter $\ell$ has a profound influence on these observables, with $\ell > 0$ suppressing and $\ell < 0$ increasing the deflection angle compared to the Kerr case. We compare RBBH observables with those of Kerr black holes, using Sgr A* and M87* as lenses to observe the effect of the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter $\ell$. For Sgr A*, the angular position $\theta_\infty$ in $\in~(18.25-33.3)~\mu as$, while for M87* $\in~(13.71-25.02)~\mu as$. The angular separation $s$, for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) Sgr A* and M87*, differs significantly, with values ranging $\in~(0.005-0.81)~\mu as$ for Sgr A* and $\in~(0.003-0.6)~\mu as$ for M87*. The relative magnitude $r_{\text{mag}}$ $\in~(3.04-8.15)~\mu as$. We also compared the time delays between the relativistic images in the SMBHs and found that RBBH can be quantitatively distinguished from Kerr black holes. Our analysis concludes that, within the 1$\sigma$ region, a significant portion of the parameter space agrees with the EHT results of M87* and Sgr A*. This demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing strong gravitational lensing to identify Lorentz symmetry violations in extreme gravity regimes. Weak lensing analysis and Einstein ring observations provide further constraints, producing an upper bound of $\ell \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$.",
New submissions,Big bounce and black bounce in quasi-topological gravity,"Yi Ling,Zhangping Yu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the framework of quasi-topological (QT) gravity, we propose a novel model which is characterized by a bounce of the spacetime such that the singularity in standard general relativity can be avoided in both cosmological and black hole setups. Specifically, in the cosmological background, this model reproduces the modified Friedmann equation proposed in loop quantum cosmology, while in a black hole background, it produces a black bounce metric identical to that of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS) model. This model resolves the singularity presented in the qOS model and provides a unified, manifestly covariant framework for general spacetimes, from which both the modified Friedmann equation and the qOS black hole metric can be derived. Furthermore, it establishes a profound correspondence between the effective dynamics of loop quantum cosmology and the QT gravity theory, suggesting that certain quantum gravitational effects in loop quantum gravity can be captured by adding an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action.",
New submissions,Angular momentum in the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity,"J. B. Formiga,R. D. Costa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In teleparallelism one is able to tackle the gravitational energy and angular momentum problems in a way that distinguishes this theory from other theories of gravity, such as general relativity. However, unlike the $4$-momentum, the quantity that is usually identified with a type of angular momentum does not have a clear interpretation. This problem is discussed, in particular the vanishing of the $3$-angular momentum in the time gauge, and some general properties are obtained.",
New submissions,Heat propagation in rotating relativistic bodies,"Lorenzo Gavassino,Marco Antonelli",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate heat propagation in rigidly rotating bodies within the theory of general relativity. Using a first-order gradient expansion, we derive a universal partial differential equation governing the temperature evolution. This equation is hyperbolic, causal, and stable, and it naturally accounts for both rotational and gravitational Tolman-Ehrenfest effects. Any other first-order theory consistent with established physics (including the parabolic theories used in neutron star cooling models) must be equivalent to our formulation within an error that is of higher order in gradients. As a case study, we analyze heat transfer in solid cylinders rotating around their symmetry axis, so that the tangential speed approaches the speed of light on the surface. We also compute the relativistic rotational corrections to the cooling law of black bodies.",
New submissions,Shadows cast by a class of rotating black bounces with an anisotropic fluid,"Ernesto F. Eiroa,Juan M. Paez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we introduce a family of rotating black bounces with an anisotropic fluid obtained by using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm. We analyze the main features of these spacetimes and obtain the geodesics for photons, which admit the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We then determine the shape of the shadow in terms of the parameters of the model. We present some relevant examples that exhibit some traits that distinguish these spacetimes from other related ones appearing in the literature.",
New submissions,Enhanced long-duration gravitational-wave transient sources search pipeline with denoising and tree clustering algorithms,"Hugo Einsle,Marie-Anne Bizouard,Adrian Macquet",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present a two-stage upgrade to the PySTAMPAS pipeline that boosts the search for long-duration (10 to 10^3 s) transients in gravitational-wave detector data. First, a denoising scheme combines complex 2D wavelet shrinkage with an adaptive pixel threshold to suppress noise while retaining signal power. Second, a KDTree nearest-neighbour algorithm clusters surviving pixels in O(log n) time, replacing the standard clustering approach. Tests with one week of LIGO O3b data show a large reduction in false-alarm rate and up to a factor-of-two improvement in search sensitivity. The computational time is also significantly reduced. These gains extend the sensitivity of all-sky, all-time searches to weaker and shorter transients, enabling rapid and deeper analyses in forthcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observation campaigns.",
New submissions,Hawking-Rényi thermodynamics of rotating black holes from locally Kiselev-type behavior,"Viktor G. Czinner,Hideo Iguchi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The Hawking-Rényi model requires the Rényi entropy thermodynamic temperature of a black hole to be identical with the surface gravity defined-, Hawking temperature. We investigate this approach for stationary black hole space-times, and show that a locally Kiselev-type behavior around the horizon with a coupled anisotropic fluid is sufficient to provide a solution to the problem. In addition, due to the rotating motion, an extra shift has also to be present in the effective mass of the black hole, which is determined by the rotation parameter, $a$, and the Rényi parameter, $\lambda$. We consider space-times with and without electric charge, and show that the functional form of the solution is the same for both cases. A full thermodynamic analysis of the model falls beyond the scope of this Letter, the main achievements are the derivation and interpretation of the solution.",
New submissions,Agegraphic dark energy from entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole,"Qihong Huang,He Huang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we analyze the agegraphic dark energy from the entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole using the age of the universe as the IR cutoff. This model realizes the whole evolution of the universe, including the late-time accelerated expansion, and is consistent with observational Hubble data. Although it asymptotically approaches the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the future, statefinder analysis shows that late-time deviations allow the two models to be distinguished.",
New submissions,Bouncing Cosmology in Interacting Scalar-Torsion Gravity,"S. A. Kadam,A. S. Agrawal",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study we demonstrate the interacting teleparallel gravity models, to describe the matter bounce scenario. We discussed two interacting models and find both are suitable choice to describe the bouncing phenomena. The co-moving Hubble radius, is demonstrated to check the establishment of the matter bounce scenario. All the energy conditions and the behaviour of EoS parameter is analysed. The violation of NEC at bounce epoch is one of the crucial result to establish bouncing behaviour is found to be obeyed. The other energy conditions behaviour is in agreement with the EoS parameter which lies in the phantom region at the bounce epoch in both the models.",
New submissions,Temperature of McVittie Black Holes in Cavities,Shi-Bei Kong,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we study the temperature of the McVittie black holes in cavities. The cavities are isothermal boxes that can make the McVittie black holes thermodynamically stable. The McVittie black holes are dynamical black holes, so the traditional action method can hardly be used to calculate the cavity temperature. We find that the cavity temperature $T_c$ can be derived from the McVittie black hole temperature $T_+$ and the Tolman relation. By setting $H^2$ to be $\Lambda/3$, we also get the cavity temperature of de Sitter black holes, which are interestingly the same with the results from the action method, but our method is much more easier.",
New submissions,One-loop corrections to infrared GWs is forbidden by symmetries,"Cheng-Jun Fang,Han-Wen Hu,Zong-Kuan Guo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Small-scale scalar perturbations amplified during inflation can induce primordial gravitational waves through tensor-scalar interactions. A long-standing controversial issue is whether the one-loop corrections to tensor perturbations exist on large scales. Firstly, we demonstrate through direct one-loop calculations that one-loop corrections cancel each other out on large scales. We then proceed from the symmetry of the interacting system and directly prove, based on the Ward identity, the absence of one-loop corrections on large scales-without the need for specific loop diagram calculations. This is consistent with the results we previously obtained for scalar perturbations.",
New submissions,Shadows of Rotating Black Hole Solution with a Dark Matter Halo,"Uktamjon Uktamov,Sanjar Shaymatov,Bobomurat Ahmedov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we start from static black hole (BH) immersed in a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo and employ the Newman-Janis algorithm (NJA) to generate the rotating black hole solution with a dark matter halo. Then we study optical properties of newly obtained rotating BH in DM halo, including the shadow's geometrical shape, photon sphere and the dependence of the shadow radius from DM parameters. Additionally, assuming that spacetime of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) is described by the newly obtained rotating BH solution we analyze the parameters of the model with shadow size estimates based on the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sara* SMBHs.",
New submissions,Probing Formation Channels of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals,"Houyi Sun,Ya-Ping Li,Zhen Pan,Huan Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The population study of stellar-mass black hole (sBH) binaries with ground-based gravitational wave detection has achieved tremendous success in recent years. Future observation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals will similarly require proper population analysis that identify the formation channels, measuring the branch ratio(s) and characterizing major properties within each major channel. In this work, we propose that the measurement of eccentricity, inclination, and component mass provides critical information to distinguish different formation channels and probe detailed formation mechanisms. Focusing on the dry and wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals, we establish the theoretical expectation of these observables in each formation channel. We also discuss how their distributions can be used to probe lifetime and turbulence level of active galactic nuclei disks, accretion patterns of supermassive black holes and population properties of sBHs within nuclear star clusters.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics of charged black points in vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics,Vladimir Sokolov,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The paper analyzes the thermodynamic properties of a special state of charged black holes, in which the event horizon becomes point-like and coincides with the singularity. It is shown that for such states, called black points, in contrast to Reissner-Nordström black holes, the third law of thermodynamics in Planck's formulation is fulfilled. It is also shown that the formation of a black point is not a first-order phase transition. Considerable attention is paid to the special state of a black point with a doubly degenerate horizon, similar to the extreme state of a Reissner-Nordström black hole.",
New submissions,Extreme black points in Born-Infeld electrodynamics,Vladimir Sokolov,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The article considers the space-time structure of a charged black hole in the nonlinear Born-Infeld electrodynamics. We are discussing a special state of such a black hole in the form of a ""black point"" with a doubly degenerate horizon, for which the pseudo-Riemannian spacetime has a timelike singularity, and the effective space-time for photons turns out to be everywhere regular. This property makes extreme black points an intermediate state between traditional and absolutely regular black holes.",
New submissions,An Unfinished Collaboration with A. A. Starobinsky,Thibault Damour,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),The present text summarizes some of the results obtained in 2008 during the initial stages of a collaboration with Starobinsky which remained unfinished. The collaboration was an attempt to apply the stochastic approach to infrared (IR) quantum-gravity effects in an inflationary spacetime.,
New submissions,A novel non-metricity extension of scalar-tensor gravity in spatially curved spacetime,"Ghulam Murtaza,Avik De,Andronikos Paliathanasis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory within the framework of scalar-tensor gravity formulated in non-metricity geometry, focusing on spatially curved FLRW spacetimes. Employing the dynamical systems approach with Hubble-normalized variables, we reformulate the field equations into an autonomous system and analyze the resulting critical points. Four distinct cases, determined by the scalar coupling and potential functions, are studied in detail. For each case, we identify the existence and stability of equilibrium points, classify their cosmological behavior, and compute key observables such as the deceleration parameter and effective equation of state. Our results reveal that the theory admits matter-dominated eras, parameter-dependent saddle solutions, and stable de Sitter attractors capable of driving late-time cosmic acceleration. The additional scalar degree of freedom introduced by the non-coincident gauge plays a crucial role in determining the system's dynamics and viability. These findings emphasize the potential of scalar-tensor non-metricity gravity as a robust extension of general relativity and motivate further confrontation of the model with observational data.",
New submissions,Remembering Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat,Thibault Damour,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph),"I describe the impact of some of the mathematical results of Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat on gravitational physics, as well as the evolution of my interactions with her over the years.",
New submissions,Generalised focusing theorem and dynamical horizon entropy in diffeomorphism-invariant theories,Zihan Yan,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"I summarise recent progress on light-ray focusing and horizon thermodynamics in general diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity coupled to bosonic matter. In pure gravity and with scalar or vector fields, the null-null gravitational equation of motion on a linearly perturbed Killing horizon generalises the Raychaudhuri equation, defining a generalised expansion that never increases under the null energy condition. This proves a generalised focusing theorem and defines an increasing horizon entropy (Wall entropy). When higher-spin fields are present, the generalised focusing theorem persists subject to a ""higher-spin focusing condition"", which I propose as a physical consistency constraint on higher-spin theories.",
New submissions,Lensing in matched exterior and interior Kottler solutions,Mourad Guenouche,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze gravitational lensing in a matched Kottler or Schwarzschild--de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where a uniform-density fluid sphere is smoothly joined to the exterior Kottler solution. We derive analytic expressions for the deflection angle of light rays traversing both regions, isolating the corrections induced by the interior mass distribution relative to the vacuum SdS case. The interior terms systematically reduce the bending angle and tangential magnification while enhancing the radial one, leading to a scale-dependent effect on the total magnification. Numerical evaluation shows a mild amplification for galaxy lenses and a demagnification for clusters, reflecting the contrast between compact and diffuse configurations. The induced $\Lambda$-contribution from the interior corrections further reduces the bending, but only slightly, consistent with its role in the vacuum SdS case. These results demonstrate that lensing observables retain a measurable imprint of interior structure in SdS-like lenses, crucial for refining realistic strong-lensing models.",
New submissions,Stability of Relativistic Spheres Powered by Energy Profile in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Gravity,"Z. Yousaf,Kazuharu Bamba,Mansoor Alshehri,A. Farhat",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we study the dynamical irregularity of the locally anisotropic spherical fluids in the context of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We aim to describe the causes of energy-density irregularity of self-gravitating fluids and explain how those causes evolved from a homogeneous distribution at first. After computing field equations, we formulate two independent components of evolution equations. This expression involves the Weyl tensor and dynamical variables that would lead us to explain the emergence of inhomogeneity patterns. The relevant quantities involved in the irregularities within the initially homogeneous system are analyzed by considering particular non-dissipative and dissipative distribution cases. We find the theoretical irregularity factor consistent with astrophysical observations. With this relation, it is explicitly demonstrated that in the presence of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity terms, the inhomogeneity term decreases its role gradually as the observer moves away from the center towards the boundary surface.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics of Kerr black hole: Tsallis-Cirto composition law and entropy quantization,G.E. Volovik,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordström black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons.",
New submissions,Interior Dynamics of Regular Schwarzschild Black Holes,J. Ovalle,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We present a purely geometric and exact description of the interior dynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole, formulated without invoking any specific gravitational theory and free of charges beyond its total mass ${\cal M}$. Its dynamical evolution gives rise to new singularities absent in the static case, whose resolution imposes highly restrictive conditions on gravitational collapse.",
New submissions,General approach to vacuum nonsingular black holes: exact solutions from equation of state,O. B. Zaslavskii,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider spherically symmetric static black hole configurations that obey the vacuum equation of state: $p_{r}=-\rho $, where $p_{r}$ is the radial pressure, $\rho $ being energy density. We find in a closed form the metric for an arbitrary equation of state for tangential pressure $p_{\theta }(\rho )$. The corresponding formulas enable us to embrace compact Schwarzschild-like configurations and dispersed systems. They include metrics with a regular center and singular ones. In a particular case, the metric of the Kiselev black hole is reproduced.",
New submissions,Investigating Hardware Injections in LIGO O3 Data: Simulated Signals from a Neutron Star in a Low-Mass X-ray Binary,"Jediah Tau,John T. Whelan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"During LIGO s third observing run (O3), simulated continuous gravitational wave (CW) signals were added to the detectors via hardware (HW) injections, which are physical injections into the interferometer control loop. These included two periodic signals mimicking a spinning neutron star in a binary system, similar to the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1). HW injections serve as an important validation of a search method, as they occur before data cleaning and preparation. We searched for these injections using a cross-correlation pipeline, which searched for CWs from Sco X-1 in the O3 run. To simulate a realistic search, we used a search region of orbital parameter space of similar size to the plausible parameter ranges for Sco X-1, but containing the parameters of each HW injection. Our self-blinded analysis confidently detects one of the injections. The other, which was generated with a lower amplitude and in a more expensive region of frequency space, was not detected. We verified the imprint of this second signal by performing a deeper targeted search at its true parameters. However, such a deep search across the full parameter range would have been computationally infeasible.",
New submissions,The Teukolsky scalar as a gateway for quantizing gravity on rotating black holes,Christiane K. M. Klein,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"The quantization of linearized gravity on black hole spacetimes and the construction of states for that theory is a sought-after, yet difficult achievement. One of the main reasons is the difficulty of reconciling the positivity and gauge invariance of potential states. On Kerr spacetimes, the spin-2 Teukolsky scalars express the same degrees of freedom as the metric perturbations, up to pure gauge and radiative solutions, while avoiding the issue of gauge. In this work, we therefore explore the quantization of Teukolsky scalars on Kerr. We demonstrate that the theory can be written in terms of a formally hermitian Green-hyperbolic operator, allowing the construction of the algebra of observables. The reconstruction scheme for the metric perturbation allows us to keep track of the physical subalgebra. We indicate how this can be used to construct the Unruh state for this theory on any subextreme Kerr spacetime. This is based on a joint work with Dietrich Häfner in preparation.",
New submissions,Possible types of dark matter condensation in embedding gravity,"S.A. Paston,A.J. Ziyatdinov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the possibility of explaining the observed effects usually attributed to the existence of dark matter through a transition from GR to a modified theory of gravity - embedding gravity. Since this theory can be reformulated as GR with additional fictitious matter of embedding gravity (FMEG), which moves independently of ordinary matter, we analyse solutions in which FMEG behaves similarly to cold dark matter. An upper bound on the possible density of FMEG is obtained, which explains the absence of dark matter effects on small scales. Possible static condensed structures of FMEG are found, which can be reduced to configurations of the types wall, string, and sphere. In the latter case, FMEG exhibits the properties of an isothermal ideal gas which has a linear equation of state. The emerging spherical condensations of FMEG create potential wells that facilitate galaxy formation. For large values of the radius, the corresponding density distribution profile behaves in the same way as the pseudo-isothermal profile (ISO), which is successfully employed in fitting galactic dark halo regions, and provides flat galactic rotation curves.",
New submissions,Hyperbolic Mass in 2+1 Dimensions,Raphaela Wutte,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"This short review surveys mass for two-dimensional asymptotically locally hyperbolic initial data sets. I explain the difficulties in defining mass in spatial dimension two, which are resolved via minimisation using a positive energy theorem, and review how gluing theorems can be used to construct novel initial data sets with controlled mass.",
New submissions,Strong gravitational lensing by compact objects with magnetic dipole,Jin Young Kim,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Compact objects with magnetic dipole are considered as gravitational lenses. The presence of strong magnetic field near the photon sphere can affect the trajectory of light. We compute the deflection angle near the photon sphere on the equatorial plane of the magnetic dipole. In the Einstein-Maxwell gravity we use the asymptotic metric when a massive object has a magnetic dipole moment. In the Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity we use the effective metric accomodating the nonlinear electrodynamic effect. The deflection angles are expressed as perturbations from the Schwarzschild lensing. As a numerical estimate, we apply the result to a magnetar.",
New submissions,Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on the cosmological evolution in a Universe with a Weylian Boundary,"Teodora M. Matei,Cristian Croitoru,Tiberiu Harko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the effects that arise from the inclusion of Weylian boundary terms in the Einstein gravitational field equations in the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) framework. With the help of the generalized Friedmann equations for a Universe with a Weylian boundary, obtained for a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker FLRW metric, three distinct cosmological models can be constructed. The cosmological evolution is determined by a dissipative scalar field, and by the Weyl vector coming from the boundary. Several cosmological scenarios are obtained via the appropriate splitting of the generalized energy conservation equation. In the present work we obtain relevant constraints on these models by using the BBN data. In particular, the effects on the BBN that arise in the post warm-inflationary era will be examined by theoretically evaluating the measured abundances of relic nuclei (Hydrogen, Deuterium, Helium-3, Helium-4, and Lithium-7). We consider firstly the primordial mass fraction estimates, and their deviations due to changes in the freezing temperature, which impose an upper limit on the effective energy density obtained from the modified Friedmann equations. The deviation from the standard energy density of the radiative plasma is therefore constrained by the abundances of the Helium-4 nuclei. Secondly, an upper limit will be considered in a numerical analysis performed through the usage of the \texttt{PRyMordial} software package, with the help of which we calculate the primordial abundances of the light elements by evaluating the thermonuclear rates within the considered modified gravity framework. Finally, an MCMC analysis will validate the cosmological model with Weylian boundary contributions, imposing relevant constraints on the initial conditions of the cosmos. The methodology is implemented in the python code \texttt{genesys}, which is available on GitHub.",
New submissions,Asymptotic Generation of Kerr Geometry from Schwarzschild via BMS Supertranslations,"Nihar Ranjan Ghosh,Malay K. Nandy",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, as the asymptotic symmetry group of asymptotically flat spacetimes, plays a central role in connecting infrared structures of gravity with soft theorems and gravitational memory. In this work, we investigate the extent to which BMS supertranslations can relate physically distinct black hole geometries. Focusing on the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions, we show that the asymptotic structure of the Kerr spacetime can be generated from the Schwarzschild geometry via two successive supertranslations. These transformations yield a Kerr-like geometry at null infinity and reveal two distinct classes of supertranslation functions. The first, composed of $l=1$ spherical harmonics, corresponds to center-of-mass displacements and encodes the translational sector of the BMS group. The second, characterized by an infinite series of even-parity Legendre polynomials ($l \geq 2$), captures the intrinsic mass multipole structure of the Kerr spacetime. Our result illustrates how BMS supertranslations can act as symmetry transformations linking asymptotically flat black hole geometries, and that they encode physically meaningful soft hair consistent with the multipole structure of rotating black holes. This work supports a unified description of soft degrees of freedom in black hole spacetimes and underscores the role of infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetries in gravitational physics.",
New submissions,Construction of Rotating Sen Black Holes via the Newman-Janis Algorithm and Applications to Accretion Disks and Shadows,"Ziqiang Cai,Zhenglong Ban,Qi-Qi Liang,Haiyuan Feng,Zheng-Wen Long",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we derive a rotating Sen black hole (BH) solution from the nonrotating limit static metric of the Sen BH using the Newman-Janis algorithm (NJA) and investigate the thin accretion disk and shadow of the rotating Sen BH. The characteristics of the rotating Sen BH, including its horizon and ergosurface, are analyzed. The results of our analysis indicate that an increase in the effective charge $q_{m}$ leads to corresponding increases in the energy flux, radiation temperature, and spectral luminosity. It is observed that the BH shadow size decreases with an increase in the parameter $q_{m}$. Furthermore, by comparing the theoretically predicted shadow diameters with observational data from M87$^{*}$ and Sgr A$^{*}$, we constrain the viable range of model parameters. The BH inclination angles are set to $17^{\circ}$, $50^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ for the analysis. Our results indicate that, within the constrained parameter space consistent with both M87$^{*}$ and Sgr A$^{*}$, the shared parameter bounds derived from the rotating Sen BH are given by $0.133158M<q_{m}<0.215561M$.",
New submissions,Photon surfaces extensions for dynamical gravitational collapse,"Roberto Giambò,Camilla Lucamarini",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The equations for the photon surface in spherical symmetry are worked out, starting fromarXiv:gr-qc/0005050, in the most general dynamical setting. We show that the condition for a timelike hypersurface to be a photon surface can be reformulated as a non-autonomous dynamical system, whose analysis reveals that the same condition also holds when the surface is generated by a null radial geodesic.As an application, we consider a well-known model of a spherical dust cloud undergoing gravitational collapse. Comparing our findings with those inarXiv:1910.13758we establish that the photon surface uniquely extends in the interior spacetime as a null hypersurface, allowing us to analytically investigate whether it covers the singularity developing in the LTB model.",
New submissions,Properties of the magnetic universe with positive cosmological constant,"Yu-Xuan Toh,Yun-Ten Chin,Ethan Quanrun Wu,Yen-Kheng Lim",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The properties of the Melvin-type spacetime with a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in $d$-dimensional Einstein--Maxwell gravity is studied. The solution is parametrised in terms of the `de Sitter radius' $\ell\propto\Lambda^{-1/2}$ and the magnetic field parameter $\beta$, and they are warped products of the form $\mathbb{R}^{1,d-3}\times S^2$, where $\mathbb{R}^{1,d-3}$ is the $(d-2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and $S^2$ is topologically a two-sphere which contains a conical singularity, whose nature depends on the product $\beta\ell$. In the limit $\ell\rightarrow\infty$, the $S^2$ decompactifies and the $d$-dimensional Melvin universe is recovered. The Freund--Rubin-type flux compactification model is shown to be another particular limit of this solution. We also calculate the flux and geodesics in this spacetime.",
New submissions,Quantum reference frames for spacetime symmetries and large gauge transformations,Daan W. Janssen,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Symmetries are a central concept in our understanding of physics. In quantum theories, a quantum reference frame (QRF) can be used to distinguish between observables related by a symmetry. The framework of operational QRFs provides a means to describe observables in terms of their relation to a reference quantum system. We discuss a number of applications of QRFs in the context of quantum field theory on curved spacetimes: 1) A type reduction result for algebras arising from QFTs and QRFs with good thermal properties. 2) Quantisation of boundary electric fluxes and gluing procedures for quantum electromagnetism on spacetimes with boundaries.",

Recent studies of the BH pseudospectrum have revealed instabilities in QNMs. Here, we introduce a new perspective using hidden symmetries in the BH dynamics, specifically the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals - an infinite series of conserved quantities. By analyzing modified BH potentials, we find strong evidence that KdV integrals are valuable indicators for detecting instabilities in QNMs and GBFs.",
New submissions,Inflationary dynamics of non-minimally coupled $f(R)$ matter-curvature theories,"Miguel Barroso Varela,Orfeu Bertolami,Andreas Mantziris",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This study examines how inflationary dynamics are affected by $f(R)$ theories with a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Both positive and negative corrections to the minimal coupling of General Relativity are considered, and a robust numerical method is developed that evolves the metric and the inflaton field in this modified theory beyond slow-roll. Through a stability analysis, we find that positive models are inherently unstable during slow-roll, whereas negative ones can accommodate a stable attractor de Sitter solution. Using the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum from the latest data releases, we constrain the scale of the non-minimal coupling to be above $10^{13}$ GeV. In light of the 2018 Planck, BICEP/Keck and the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope data for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, strong constraints on the coupling strength force the effects of these modified theories to be, at most, slightly above the perturbative level. Furthermore, we determine that the choice of the perfect fluid matter Lagrangian does not impact the inflationary observables at the pivot scale. Finally, we present the predicted observables for different inflationary potentials and show that even though classical gravity is still preferred by the data, there are areas of the parameter space that are viable for non-minimally coupled inflationary models.",
New submissions,Quantum dust cores of black holes and their quasi-normal modes,"Tommaso Bambagiotti,Luca Gallerani,Andrea Mentrelli,Andrea Giusti,Roberto Casadio",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The quantum description of a gravitationally collapsed ball of dust proposed in Ref.~\cite{Casadio:2023ymt} is characterised by a linear effective Misner-Sharp-Hernandez mass function describing a matter core hidden by the event horizon. After reviewing the original model and some of its refinements, we investigate the quasi-normal mode spectrum of the resulting spacetime and compare it with the Schwarzschild case. Computations are performed within the WKB approximation, based on the Padé approximants up to thirteenth order. Our analysis shows that deviations from the Schwarzschild spectrum are sensitive to the quantum nature of the core surface.",
New submissions,Probing modified gravitational-wave dispersion with bursts from eccentric black-hole binaries,"Nicholas Loutrel,Ava Bailey,Davide Gerosa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves in general relativity are non-dispersive, yet a host of modified theories predict dispersion effects during propagation. In this work, we consider the impact of dispersion effects on gravitational-wave bursts from highly eccentric binary black holes. We consider the dispersion effects within the low-energy, effective field theory limit, and model the dispersion relation via standard parameterized deformations. Such modified dispersion relations produce two modifications to the burst waveform: a modification to the time of arrival of the bursts in the detector, which appears as a 2.5PN correction to the difference in burst arrival times, and a modification to the arrival time of individual orbital harmonics within the bursts themselves, resulting in a Bessel-type amplitude modulation of the waveform. Using the Fisher information matrix, we study projected constraints one might obtain with future observations of repeating burst signals with LIGO. We find that the projected constraints vary significantly depending on the theoretical mechanism producing the modified dispersion. For massive gravitons and multifractional spacetimes that break Lorentz invariance, bounds on the coupling parameters are generally weaker than current bounds. For other Lorentz invariance breaking models such as Hořava-Lifschitz gravity, as well as scenarios with extra dimensions, the bounds in optimal cases can be 1-6 orders of magnitude stronger than current bounds.",
New submissions,Conformal Geometry and Regularization of Disclinations by a Cosmological Constant in $(2+1)$ Dimensions,"A. Carvalho,C. Furtado",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the effect of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ on the geometry generated by a two-dimensional disclination in a conformal metric framework. For $\Lambda>0$, we obtain an exact analytic solution of the Liouville-type equation, which regularizes the defect core, preserves the topological charge, and yields a compact space with finite volume and positive curvature. For $\Lambda<0$, the solution must be obtained numerically and asymptotically approaches $R \to 3\Lambda < 0$, producing an open hyperbolic geometry with divergent volume.In both regimes, the curvature profile is governed solely by the disclination strength $\alpha$, while the sign of $\Lambda$ dictates the global phase: compact and confined for $\Lambda>0$, hyperbolic and delocalized for $\Lambda<0$. This establishes a clear geometric dichotomy and shows that the cosmological constant provides a natural analytic regularization beyond cutoff-based treatments, with implications for analog gravity and two-dimensional condensed matter systems.",
New submissions,Gravitational memory meets astrophysical environments: exploring a new frontier through osculations,"Rishabh Kumar Singh,Shailesh Kumar,Abhishek Chowdhuri,Arpan Bhattacharyya",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present the first study of how dark matter environments influence nonlinear gravitational memory from intermediate-mass-ratio binaries. Incorporating dark matter effects-gravitational potential, dynamical friction, and accretion-we compute nonlinear memory for both bound and unbound orbits under dark matter minispikes and Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. For quasi-circular orbits within a minispike profile, we further account empirically for the evolution of the dark matter density. Our findings reveal significant deviations from the vacuum case, with important implications for the detectability of gravitational memory by future gravitational wave observatories. These results underscore the role of astrophysical environments in shaping gravitational memory, strengthening its interpretation as a hereditary imprint of past binary evolution and providing a novel bridge between dark matter physics and memory effects.",
New submissions,Photon helicity asymmetry and duality anomaly in rotating waveguides,Adrian del Rio,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In quantum field theory, photon pairs can be excited out of the vacuum under the influence of dynamical gravitational fields. If the classical electromagnetic duality symmetry held at the quantum level, equal numbers of right- vs left-handed modes would be excited. However, a quantum chiral-like anomaly is known to affect this symmetry. In this work, we explore more experimentally accessible manifestations of this anomaly in analogue-gravity systems. Specifically, we describe the physical mechanism by which rotating, accelerating waveguides can induce an imbalance between right- and left-handed photons excited from the vacuum -- effectively signaling the emergence of the electromagnetic duality anomaly in controlled laboratory settings. To build physical intuition, we review first the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in 1+1 dimensions, which elegantly illustrates the connection between asymmetric particle pair creation and chiral anomalies.",
New submissions,Thermality and athermality in the Unruh effect,"D. Jaffino Stargen,Vivishek Sudhir",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In idealized treatments of the Unruh effect, a two-level atom is accelerated in a prescribed classical trajectory through the vacuum of a quantum field -- the Unruh bath -- which causes the atom's internal state to thermalize to a temperature proportional to the acceleration. This happens via emission and absorption of quanta by the atom, leading to a detailed balance between fluctuations in the Unruh bath and associated dissipation of the atom's internal energy. In any physical manifestation of the Unruh effect, the center-of-mass (CoM) degree of freedom of the atom is dynamical, and is therefore coupled to the Unruh bath via momentum recoil during the absorption/emission process. We study this scenario and show how the fluctuation-dissipation theorem fails for the CoM degree of freedom, while still being upheld for the internal energy. That is, the CoM of an accelerated atom is not in thermal equilibrium with the Unruh bath, while its internal level can be.",
New submissions,Detection of a Higher Harmonic Quasi-normal Mode in the Ringdown Signal of GW231123,"Hai-Tian Wang,Shao-Peng Tang,Peng-Cheng Li,Yi-Zhong Fan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The ringdown phase of a gravitational wave signal from a binary black hole merger offers a unique laboratory for testing general relativity in the strong-field regime and probing the properties of the final remnant black hole. In this study, we analyze the ringdown of GW231123 and find strong evidence for a multimode quasinormal spectrum. Our analysis employs two time-domain methodologies: a full Bayesian inference and an enhanced F-statistic framework, which we extend to enable the calculation of Bayesian evidence and the reconstruction of posterior distributions for all model parameters. We report a statistically significant detection of the $\ell|m|n=200$ mode, with a $\log_{10}$(Bayes factor) of $5.3$, commencing at $12\,M$ after the peak amplitude--a time well within the accepted linear regime. This two-mode analysis yields a redshifted final mass of $305.6^{+35.7}_{-47.3}M _{\odot}$ and a final spin of $0.84^{+0.07}_{-0.14}$ at $90\%$ credibility, from a ringdown signal with a network signal-to-noise ratio of approximately $14.5$. Furthermore, a test of the no-hair theorem performed using the two detected modes reveals no deviation from the predictions of general relativity. These results highlight the power of the F-statistic methodology to uncover nuanced features in gravitational wave signals, thereby providing novel insights into the fundamental properties of black holes.",

New submissions,Loop Quantum Vector-Tensor Gravity and Its Spherically Symmetric Model,"Shengzhi Li,Yongge Ma",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Hamiltoinian analysis of the vector-tensor theory of gravity is performed. The resulting geometrical dynamics is reformulated into the connection dynamics, with the real SU(2)-connection serving as one of the configuration variables. This formulation allows us to extend the loop quantization scheme of general relativity to the vector-tensor theory, thereby rigorously constructing its quantum kinematical framework. The scalar constraint is promoted to a well-defined operator in the vertex Hilbert space, to represent quantum dynamics. Moreover, the spherically symmetric model of the vector-tensor theory is obtained by the symmetric reduction. Following the general deparametrization strategy for theories with diffeomorphism invariance, the spherically symmetric model can be fully deparametrized in terms of the degrees of freedom of the vector field. The corresponding reduced phase space quantization is carried out. The physical Hamiltonian generating relative evolution is promoted to a well-defined operator on the physical Hilbert space.",

In this paper, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by matter isocurvature fluctuations in a generic perfect fluid background as a novel probe of the physics of the very early Universe. We analytically compute the induced GW kernel and analyze the spectral GW energy density for a sharply peaked isocurvature power spectrum. We show that the spectral shape of the GW signal is sensitive to the equation of state parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid dominating the early Universe after inflation. We find that the GW amplitude is enhanced for a soft equation of state. Our framework can be applied to dark matter isocurvature and models leading to early matter-dominated eras, such as primordial black holes and cosmological solitons.",
New submissions,The non-minimal 3-form cosmology and the rise of the cuscuton,"Antonio De Felice,Anamaria Hell",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider the 3-form theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity in an expanding Universe. First, we assume that the background is homogeneous and isotropic, and that the three-form is coupled to both the Ricci scalar and the Ricci tensor. We show that in this case, it propagates three degrees of freedom: a scalar mode and two tensor ones. Then, we consider an anisotropic background that corresponds to a Bianchi Type I Universe, and set the coupling with the Ricci tensor to zero. We show that, similarly to the Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity, this case leads to two branches for the background solutions - depending on the values of the 3-form. However, in contrast to the Proca case, we show that no extra modes appear. We explore the no-ghost conditions and speed of propagation for all three modes in both branches. Finally, we show that one of the branches can be written as a theory of a constrained scalar, coupled to a cuscuton field.",

Cross submissions,"Very Massive, Rapidly Spinning Binary Black Hole Progenitors through Chemically Homogeneous Evolution -- The Case of GW231123","Silvia A. Popa,Selma E. de Mink",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Among the over 200 gravitational wave detections reported so far, GW231123 is a remarkable event that not only holds the record for the most massive black hole merger, but also exhibits extreme spins. Its origin is actively debated. Proposed scenarios include dynamical formation involving a sequence of mergers, Population III stars, accretion in an AGN disk and also more exotic explanations including primordial black holes and cosmic strings, each facing different challenges. Recent work showed that the incoming black holes of GW231123 can be formed out of massive rapidly rotating collapsing helium stars. Here, we address the question how such very massive rapidly rotating helium stars can be formed in very close binary systems. For this we explore chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) involving progenitors with masses above the pair-instability mass gap. We compute a grid of detailed massive binary models with the stellar evolution code MESA to follow the early evolution of binary progenitors and show that: (i) very massive ($M_i > 140\, M_\odot$) CHE binaries at low metallicity ($Z=10^{-5}$) naturally produce rapidly rotating progenitors with high masses and high spins matching the properties of the black holes in GW231123 and (ii) the maximum spin of the progenitors is bound by their critical rotation rate leading to a tight correlation between the dimensionless spin and mass, $a \propto M^{-0.9}$, in models that have no hydrogen left. We conclude that the CHE channel appears to be a viable and natural scenario to produce progenitors. We compare and discuss the differences with earlier studies and comment on the large uncertainties in the final fate and collapse.",
Cross submissions,LHS in LHS: A new expansion strategy for Latin hypercube sampling in simulation design,"Matteo Boschini,Davide Gerosa,Alessandro Crespi,Matteo Falcone",Methodology (stat.ME); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is a prominent tool in simulation design, with a variety of applications in high-dimensional and computationally expensive problems. LHS allows for various optimization strategies, most notably to ensure space-filling properties. However, LHS is a single-stage algorithm that requires a priori knowledge of the targeted sample size. In this work, we present LHS in LHS, a new expansion algorithm for LHS that enables the addition of new samples to an existing LHS-distributed set while (approximately) preserving its properties. In summary, the algorithm identifies regions of the parameter space that are far from the initial set, draws a new LHS within those regions, and then merges it with the original samples. As a by-product, we introduce a new metric, the LHS degree, which quantifies the deviation of a given design from an LHS distribution. Our public implementation is distributed via the Python package expandLHS.",
Cross submissions,Nonradial oscillations of stratified neutron stars with solid crusts: Mode characterization and tidal resonances in coalescing binaries,"Yong Gao,Hao-Jui Kuan,Cheng-Jun Xia,Hector O. Silva,Masaru Shibata",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"Dynamical tides of neutron stars in the late stages of binary inspirals provide a viable probe into dense matter through gravitational waves, and potentially trigger electromagnetic precursors. We model the tidal response as a set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given by the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are calculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to stellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For the mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with the crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by compositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven primarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes such as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust, and we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal interaction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is dominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to resonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes induce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\sim 10^{-3},\rm rad$ for the equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and crustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first gravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the base of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both resonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel energy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering electromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward realistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger observations.",

We show that they provide gravity duals of CFTs in the presence of null boundaries. Our holographic calculations lead to many new predictions on entanglement entropy, correlation functions and partition functions for CFTs with null boundaries. By considering a bulk region between two EOW branes, we present an AdS/BCFT explanation that the flat space gravity is dual to a Carrollian CFT (CCFT), including the swing surface calculation of entanglement entropy.",

The lectures first summarize what we know observationally about the properties of Dark Energy (and the Dark sector more broadly) and then discuss several approaches to explain them. Along the way this involves determining the types of interactions that would on general grounds be expected to be present in the low-energy limit of fundamental theories involving the many hierarchy of scales we see around us. This includes (but is not limited to) a discussion of technical naturalness (and `t Hooft naturalness) as well as the arguments for their use as a criterion for distinguishing amongst candidate theories.

The elliptic pseudosphere is considered as an exactly solvable background geometry. The topological contribution is separated in the Hadamard function for general phases in the periodicity condition along the compact dimension. Two equivalent expressions are provided for the component of the current density in that direction. The corresponding VEV is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with a period equal to the flux quantum. In the flat spacetime limit, we recover the result for a conical space with a general value of the planar angle deficit. Near the origin of the elliptic pseudosphere, the effect of the spatial curvature on the vacuum current density is weak. The same applies for small values of the length of the compact dimension. Using the conformal relations between the elliptic pseudosphere and the (2+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with a planar angle deficit, we determine the current densities for a conformally coupled massless scalar field in the static and hyperbolic vacuum states of locally de Sitter spacetime.",

Using a semiclassical approach with initial velocity fluctuations, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, quantum effects do not lead to the formation of double-layered vacuum bubbles, while flyover transitions allow for their stable formation by overcoming successive potential barriers. The evolution of these bubbles, including wall acceleration, collisions, and the formation of trapped regions, is explored through numerical simulations. Our results show that the dynamics of double-layered bubbles differ significantly from standard single-wall bubbles, with implications for cosmological observables such as gravitational wave production and baryogenesis. These findings indicate that flyover transitions represent a complementary decay mechanism to the conventional quantum tunneling process.",
Cross submissions,Dissipation suppression for an Unruh-DeWitt battery with a reflecting boundary,"Xiaobao Liu,Zehua Tian,Jiliang Jing",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In the framework of open quantum systems, we study the dynamics of an accelerated quantum battery (QB), modeled as an Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field. The QB is driven by an external classical force acting as a charger. A major challenge in this setup is the environment-induced decoherence, which leads to energy dissipation of the QB. Accelerated motion exacerbates this dissipation, manifesting effects analogous to those experienced by a static QB in a thermal bath in free space, consistent with the Unruh effect. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a reflecting boundary in a space, which modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the field and leads to a position-dependent suppression of dissipation for the Unruh-DeWitt QB. Our analysis reveals that as the QB approaches the boundary, the relevant dissipation is significantly reduced. In particular, when the QB is placed extremely close to the boundary, the dissipation is nearly eliminated, as if the QB were a closed system. Furthermore, we identify a characteristic length scale associated with the acceleration of QB. When the distance between the QB and the boundary is much smaller than this scale, the boundary effectively suppresses dissipation, and this suppression effect becomes identical for both an accelerated QB and a static QB in a thermal bath. Conversely, when the distance is beyond this scale, the suppression effect weakens and manifests a significant difference between these two cases. Our findings demonstrate the potential of boundary-induced modifications in vacuum fluctuations to effectively suppress dissipation, offering valuable insights for optimizing QB performance. This work paves the way for the development of high-efficiency quantum energy storage systems in the relativistic framework.",

Then, we approach the thermodynamics in the extended phase space. After the stability discussion, we examine the P V criticality in noncommutative geometry by calculating the corresponding thermodynamic quantities. As a result, we show that the proposed black holes exhibit certain similarities with Van der Waals fluid systems.

Honda,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion number density becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion number density, $n_f$. For sufficiently large $n_f$ and low velocity, the collision of two vortices results in a pseudostable bound state with winding number $m=2$ that eventually becomes unstable and decays into two $m=1$ vortices. For large $n_f$ and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction.",

We explicitly derive the fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as heat capacity, P-V diagram, isothermal compressibility, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy, under different entropy models. We find that only the exponential corrected entropy demonstrates multiple phase transitions, which we validate with the Ricci Scalar divergence obtained from the Ruppeiner formalism. This indicates that exponential corrected entropy is more sensitive to BH's microstructure as compared to the Hawking-Bekenstein and Rènyi entropy models. In addition, we study the sparsity and emission rates of Hawking radiation, demonstrating that exponential correction entropy yields more consistent and stable behavior. In our observational analysis, we graphically demonstrate the behavior of redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shift, and identify specific conditions where the photon sphere radius exceeds the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which depends on the values of parameters such as electric charge and cosmological constant. The novel insight of this work is that despite this violation, our computed redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shifts fall within the range of the observational data of NGC 4258 and UGC 3789.",

The key observation is that $\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS$_4$ supergroup $OSp(2|4)$ can be embedded as a subgroup in the superconformal group through introducing a constant symmetric matrix $c^{(ij)}$ and identifying the AdS supercharge as $\Psi^i_\alpha = Q^i_\alpha + c^{ik} S_{k\alpha}$, with $Q$ and $S$ being generators of the standard and conformal $4D, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetries. Respectively, the AdS cosmological constant is given by the square of $c^{(ij)}$, $\Lambda = -6 c^{ij}c_{ij}$. We construct the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant hypermultiplet mass term by adding, to the coordinate AdS transformations, a piece realized as an extra $SO(2)$ rotation of the hypermultiplet superfield. It is analogous to the central charge $x_5$ transformation of flat $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and turns into the latter in the super Minkowski limit. As another new result, we explicitly construct the superfield Weyl transformation to the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant AdS integration measure over the analytic superspace, which provides, in particular, a basis for unconstrained superfield formulations of the AdS$_4$-deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ hyper Kähler sigma models.

Morley",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"A key open problem in physics is the correct way to combine gravity (described by general relativity) with everything else (described by quantum mechanics). This problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also quantum mechanics need fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that gravity should be quantum in character, but gravity is fundamentally different to the other forces because it alone is described by spacetime geometry. Experiments are needed to test whether gravity, and hence space-time, is quantum or classical. We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of gravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A pathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal first using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can subsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement. This is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental progress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a medium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including vibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress and plans towards realizing this. While implementing these plans, we will further explore the most macroscopic superpositions that are possible, which will test theories that predict a limit to this.",
Cross submissions,The Perfect Host: JWST Cepheid Observations in a Background-Free SN Ia Host Confirm No Bias in Hubble-Constant Measurements,"Adam G. Riess,Siyang Li,Gagandeep S. Anand,Wenlong Yuan,Louise Breuval,Stefano Casertano,Lucas M. Macri,Dan Scolnic,Yukei S. Murakami,Alexei V. Filippenko,Thomas G. Brink",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cycle 1 JWST observations of Cepheids in SN Ia hosts resolved their red-giant-dominated NIR backgrounds, sharply reducing crowding and showing that photometric bias in lower-resolution HST data does not account for the Hubble tension. We present Cycle 2 JWST observations of >100 Cepheids in NGC 3447, a unique system that pushes this test to the limit by transitioning from low to no background contamination. NGC 3447, an SN Ia host at D~25 Mpc, is an interacting pair comprising (i) a spiral with mixed stellar populations, typical of H0 calibrators, and (ii) a young, star-forming companion (NGC 3447A) devoid of old stars and hence stellar crowdinga rare ""perfect host"" for testing photometric bias. We detect ~60 long-period Cepheids in each, enabling a ""three-way comparison"" across HST, JWST, and background-free conditions. We find no component-to-component offset (sigma<0.03 mag; a calibration independent test), and a 50% reduction in scatter to ~0.12 mag in the background-free case, the tightest seen for any SN Ia host. Across Cycles 1-2 we also measure Cepheids in all SH0ES hosts observed by JWST (19 hosts of 24 SNe Ia; >50% of the sample) and find no evidence of bias relative to HST photometry, including for the most crowded, distant hosts. These observations constitute the most rigorous test yet of Cepheid distances and provide strong evidence for their reliability. Combining JWST Cepheid measurements in 19 hosts (24 SNe Ia) with HST data (37 hosts, 42 SNe Ia) yields H0 = 73.49 +/- 0.93 km/s/Mpc. Including 35 TRGB-based calibrations (from HST and JWST) totals 55 SNe Ia and gives H0 = 73.18 +/- 0.88 km/s/Mpc, ~6 sigma above the LambdaCDM+CMB expectation.",
Cross submissions,"Quark, lepton and right-handed neutrino production via inflation","Duarte Feiteira,Fotis Koutroulis,Oleg Lebedev,Stefan Pokorski",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inflationary expansion of space-time provides us with an efficient particle production mechanism in the Early Universe. The fermion production efficiency depends critically on the particle mass, which is generated via the Yukawa coupling and sensitive to the corresponding scalar field value. During inflation, scalar fields experience large quantum fluctuations driving the average field values to the Hubble scale and above. This applies, in particular, to the Higgs field, making the Standard Model fermions very heavy and facilitating their production. Using the Bogolyubov coefficient approach, we compute the corresponding fermion abundance taking into account time dependence of the mass term. We find that the Standard Model fermion and the right-handed neutrino production grows dramatically compared to the naive estimate based on the low energy masses. The inflationary production mechanism can be the leading source of the right handed neutrinos, if they gain a Majorana mass from the Yukawa coupling to a light scalar. We also find a lower bound on the mass of fermionic dark matter, which can be produced by inflation.",

Cross submissions,Efficient Bayesian Sampling with Langevin Birth-Death Dynamics,"Alex Leviyev,Francesco Iacovelli,Aaron Zimmerman",Applications (stat.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Bayesian inference plays a central role in scientific and engineering applications by enabling principled reasoning under uncertainty. However, sampling from generic probability distributions remains a computationally demanding task. This difficulty is compounded when the distributions are ill-conditioned, multi-modal, or supported on topologically non-Euclidean spaces. Motivated by challenges in gravitational wave parameter estimation, we propose simulating a Langevin diffusion augmented with a birth-death process. The dynamics are rescaled with a simple preconditioner, and generalized to apply to the product spaces of a hypercube and hypertorus. Our method is first-order and embarrassingly parallel with respect to model evaluations, making it well-suited for algorithmic differentiation and modern hardware accelerators. We validate the algorithm on a suite of toy problems and successfully apply it to recover the parameters of GW150914 -- the first observed binary black hole merger. This approach addresses key limitations of traditional sampling methods, and introduces a template that can be used to design robust samplers in the future.",
Cross submissions,Doppler shifted Hawking radiation from acoustic black holes in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Sanatan Digal,Ajit M. Srivastava",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"In a hydrodynamic flow, with flow becoming supersonic at some point, the subsonic-supersonic boundary behaves as the horizon of a black hole. Possibility of detecting Hawking radiation from such acoustic black holes has been investigated in a variety of laboratory systems, ranging from cold atom systems, to condensed matter systems with hydrodynamic flow of electrons, to relativistic heavy-ion collisions (at relatively lower collision energies). Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, with boost-invariant longitudinal flow of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in a wide rapidity window has eluded this remarkable possibility because in this case the black hole horizon is dynamical, moving away from center with sound velocity, leading to infinite red shift of Hawking radiation. We show here that such a conclusion is premature. The QGP flow at very large rapidities, necessarily deviates from Bjroken boost invariant flow. Due to this, an observer close to that region sees black hole horizon with a finite redshift. It leads to non-trivial prediction of Hawking radiation affecting particle momentum distributions for a window of rapidities, leaving near central rapidity regions unaffected.",
Cross submissions,Operator Algebras and Third Quantization,"Yidong Chen,Marius Junge,Nima Lashkari",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In quantum gravity, the gravitational path integral involves a sum over topologies, representing the joining and splitting of multiple universes. To account for topology change, one is led to allow the creation and annihilation of closed and open universes in a framework often called third quantization or universe field theory. We argue that since topology change in gravity is a rare event, its contribution to exponentially late-time physics is universally described by a Poisson process. This universal Poisson process is responsible for the plateau in the multi-boundary generalization of the spectral form factor at late times. In the Fock space of closed baby universes, this universality implies that the statistics of the total number of baby universes is captured by a coherent state. Allowing for the creation of asymptotic open universes calls for a noncommutative generalization of a Poisson process. We propose such an operator algebraic framework, called Poissonization, which takes as input the observable algebra and a (unnormalized) state of a quantum system and outputs a von Neumann algebra of a many-body theory represented on its symmetric Fock space. Physically, Poissonization is a generalization of the coherent state vacua of bipartite quantum systems or matrix quantum mechanics. The multi-boundary correlators of the Marolf-Maxfield toy model of baby universes, and the sum over bordisms of closed-open 2D topological quantum field theory, are entirely captured by Poissonization. In the Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity, the universal Poisson process reproduces the late-time correlators in the $\tau$-scaling limit.",
Cross submissions,Eccentricity distribution of extreme mass ratio inspirals,"Davide Mancieri,Luca Broggi,Morgan Vinciguerra,Alberto Sesana,Matteo Bonetti",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present realistic eccentricity distributions for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) forming via the two-body relaxation channel in nuclear star clusters, tracking their evolution up to the final plunge onto the central Schwarzschild massive black hole (MBH). We find that EMRIs can retain significant eccentricities at plunge, with a distribution peaking at $e_\mathrm{pl} \approx0.2$, and a considerable fraction reaching much higher values. In particular, up to $20\%$ of the forming EMRIs feature $e_\mathrm{pl} > 0.5$ for central MBH masses $M_\bullet$ in the range $10^5 \mathrm{M_\odot} \leq M_\bullet \leq 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$, partially due to EMRIs forming at large semi-major axes and ""cliffhanger EMRI"", usually neglected in literature. This highlights the importance of accounting for eccentricity in waveform modeling and detection strategies for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Furthermore, we find that the numerical fluxes in energy and angular momentum currently implemented in the FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) package may not adequately sample the full parameter space relevant to low-mass MBHs ($M_\bullet < 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$), potentially limiting its predictive power in that regime. Specifically, for $M_\bullet=10^5 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ we find that about $75\%$ ($50 \%$) of EMRIs at 2 years (6 months) from plunge fall outside the currently available flux parameter space. Our findings motivate the development of extended flux grids and improved interpolation schemes to enable accurate modeling of EMRIs across a broader range of system parameters.",
