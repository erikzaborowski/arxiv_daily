New submissions,Optical images of massive boson stars with nonlinear electrodynamics,"Xiao-Xiong Zeng,Huan Ye,Ke-Jian He,Hao Yu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study investigates the optical imaging characteristics of massive boson stars based on a model with Einstein's nonlinear electrodynamics. Under asymptotically flat boundary conditions, the field equations are solved numerically to obtain the spacetime metric of the massive boson stars. Employing the ray-tracing method, we analyze the optical images of the massive boson stars under two illumination conditions: a celestial light source and a thin accretion disk. The research reveals that the configurations and optical images of the massive boson stars can be tuned via the initial parameter $\phi_0$ and the coupling constant $\Lambda$. The absence of the event horizon in the massive boson stars results in distinct optical image characteristics compared to those of black holes.",
New submissions,"Asymptotic quasinormal modes, echoes, and black hole spectral instability: a brief review","Shui-Fa Shen,Guan-Ru Li,Ramin G. Daghigh,Jodin C. Morey,Michael D. Green,Wei-Liang Qian,Rui-Hong Yue",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a short review of the analytical aspects of recent progress in the study of black hole spectral instability and its potential observational consequences. This topic, inspired by earlier foundational works, has attracted considerable attention in the recent literature. It has been demonstrated that both the low-lying modes and high overtones of black hole quasinormal spectra can be substantially influenced by ultraviolet metric perturbations. The temporal evolution of gravitational wave signals is primarily governed by the first few low-lying quasinormal modes. In contrast, the asymptotic behavior of high overtones is closely associated with the phenomenon of black hole echoes. We review relevant studies on spectral instability in both regimes, highlighting their potential to produce substantial observational signatures in gravitational wave data. Additionally, recent proposals of Regge poles and reflectionless modes as alternative stable observables for probing black hole spacetimes are summarized.",
New submissions,"Inflation in Myrzakulov $F(R,T)$ Gravity: A Comparative Study in Metric, Symmetric Teleparallel, and Weitzenböck Formalisms","Davood Momeni,Ratbay Myrzakulov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a unified treatment of cosmic inflation within the framework of Myrzakulov Gravity, exploring its realization in three different formalisms: metric (curvature-based), teleparallel (torsion-based), and symmetric teleparallel (non-metricity-based). For each case, we derive the corresponding field equations in a flat FLRW background, study inflationary solutions driven by a scalar field, and compute observable quantities such as the scalar spectral index \( n_s \) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio \( r \). In addition to these geometric sectors, we extend our analysis to the more general and dynamically richer Myrzakulov \( F(R,T) \) gravity, which incorporates both curvature \( R \) and torsion \( T \) in a unified action. We derive the inflationary dynamics in this hybrid model and investigate how it interpolates between pure \( f(R) \) and \( f(T) \) behaviors. The resulting framework allows for enhanced flexibility in matching Planck and BICEP/Keck observational constraints. We present analytic estimates and schematic predictions in the \( n_s \)--\( r \) plane, demonstrating that appropriately chosen parameters in \( F(R,T) \) models can produce viable and distinguishable inflationary signatures. This comparative and extended study highlights the potential of Myrzakulov Gravity and its generalizations to provide a consistent and geometrically motivated description of the early universe, with predictive power across different formulations of spacetime geometry.",
New submissions,Deflection of light and time delay in hyperbolic Einstein-Straus--de Sitter solution,Mourad Guenouche,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze strong gravitational lensing by a spherically symmetric mass distribution within the Einstein-Straus-de Sitter framework in a spatially open Universe with negative curvature ($k = -1$). Applying the theory to the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112, we identify a critical threshold for the current scale factor $a_0$ of approximately $2.6 \times 10^{27}$ m, below which the effects of negative spatial curvature on lensing observables become significant, corresponding to a current curvature density of $|\Omega_{k0}| \gtrsim 0.0025$. In particular, for $\Omega_{k0} = -0.15$, the light bending increases slightly by about 1%, while the time delay exhibits a more substantial increase of about 10%. Beyond this threshold, however, the lensing observables are found to be insensitive to the current scale factor and converge to those characteristic of a spatially flat Universe. Importantly, our results indicate that, even where spatial curvature would otherwise enhance lensing observables, the effect of the cosmological constant remains present and acts to reduce light bending, corroborating the claim of Rindler and Ishak.",
New submissions,Cosmological evolution driven by polytropic fluids in an inhomogeneous spacetime,"Gilberto Aguilar-Pérez,Miguel Cruz,Mohsen Fathi,Daniel de Jesús García-Castro,J. R. Villanueva",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Addressing the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe, known as the ``dark energy problem'', remains a central challenge in cosmology. While the cosmological constant is the standard explanation, alternative models such as quintessence, phantom fluids, and Chaplygin gas have been proposed. This work investigates the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model, which is characterized by a polytropic equation of state. We explore this model within the framework of an anisotropic fluid, by means of a metric that reduces to the standard form of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime at cosmological scales. To assess the model's viability, we derive analytical expressions for the scale factor, the Hubble parameter, and the deceleration parameter. Finally, the model is tested against observational data to constrain its parameters and evaluate its consistency.",
New submissions,Instability of regular planar black holes in four dimensions arising from an infinite sum of curvature corrections,"Antonio De Felice,Shinji Tsujikawa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived via dimensional regularization with a conformal rescaling of the metric, we study the stability of planar black holes (BHs) whose horizons are described by two-dimensional compact Einstein spaces with vanishing curvature. By taking an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, it is possible to construct BH solutions whose metric components remain nonsingular at $r=0$, with a scalar-field derivative given by $\phi'(r)=1/r$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. We show that such BH solutions suffer from a strong coupling problem, where the kinetic term of the even-parity scalar-field perturbation associated with the timelike coordinate vanishes everywhere. Moreover, we find that these BHs are subject to both ghost and Laplacian instabilities for odd-parity perturbations near $r=0$. Consequently, the presence of these pathological features rules out regular planar BHs with the scalar-field profile $\phi'(r)=1/r$ as physically viable and stable configurations.",
New submissions,Extracting energy from plunging region of a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole by magnetic reconnection,"Zhengwei Cheng,Songbai Chen,Jiliang Jing",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We have studied the energy extraction from a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole via magnetic reconnections occurring in the plunging region. Our results show that the gravitomagnetic charge suppresses the energy extraction process through magnetic reconnection and reduces the corresponding extraction efficiency, which is opposite to those of the black hole spin and the magnetization parameter. Finally, we treat the energy extraction process through magnetic reconnection as a mechanism to revisit the problem on the observed jet power and radiative efficiency of GRS 1915+105. Our results show that the allowed black hole parameter region originating from the jet power has an intersection with the region from the radiative efficiency. This means that with this mechanism related to magnetic reconnection the Kerr-Taub-NUT metric can simultaneously explain the observed jet power and radiative efficiency for GRS 1915+105, which is not explained by other mechanisms in previous studies.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics of BTZ-type charged black holes in Bopp Podolsky electrodynamics,"Allan. R. P. Moreira,Abdelmalek Bouzenada,Guo-Hua Sun,Shi-Hai Dong",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We tested the thermodynamic properties of charged BTZ-type black holes (BHs) in the framework of Bopp Podolsky electrodynamics, a higher derivative extension of Maxwells theory that preserves gauge invariance while introducing a massive photon mode. Using a perturbative approach, we derive first and second order corrections to the metric and electric field, revealing how the Bopp Podolsky parameter b modifies the geometry and horizon structure. Unlike in four dimensional illustrations, where such corrections can lead to wormhole solutions, the (2+1)dimensional case retains a black hole interpretation, albeit with curvature dependent deformations that vanish asymptotically. We compute the Hawking temperature via the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method, demonstrating its dependence on both the cosmological constant and the Bopp Podolsky coupling. Our results indicate that while energy conditions are marginally violated for certain parameter regimes, the BHs thermodynamic behavior remains well-defined, with temperature corrections emerging from the interplay between higher derivative electrodynamics and the lower dimensional gravitational background.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics of FLRW universe in Quadratic Gravity,"Navid Safarzadeh Ilkhchi,Amin Rezaei Akbarieh,Yaghoub Heydarzade",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic aspects of quadratic gravity in a $D$-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. First, we derive the field equations and the effective energy-momentum tensor for quadratic gravity. Then, using these equations, we obtain the generalized Misner-Sharp energy within the framework of this model. We consider the thermodynamic behavior of the apparent horizon and derive the equations of state related to the pressure, temperature, and radius of the apparent horizon. Using the thermodynamic pressure, we obtain the critical points corresponding to phase transitions. We determine the critical temperature and critical radius in terms of model parameters, including the quadratic coupling and the cosmological constant. We also examine key thermodynamic quantities, such as Wald entropy, specific heat at constant pressure, enthalpy, Gibbs free energy. By examining the behavior of these quantities, we can gain insight into the thermodynamic stability of the quadratic gravity model. In particular, we find that quadratic terms change the stability conditions and can lead to new thermodynamic behaviors compared to general relativity.",
New submissions,Early release of low-frequency atlas of continuous gravitational waves,"Vladimir Dergachev,Maria Alessandra Papa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present the public release of the low-frequency atlas of continuous gravitational waves, covering signals with frequencies from 20 Hz to 200 Hz and frequency derivatives from -5e-11 to 5e-11 Hz/s. Compared to the previous atlas releases, this version demonstrates significant improvements in sensitivity and sky resolution. In the most sensitive region even the worst-case upper limits on gravitational wave strain are below 1e-25. The atlas data is being released ahead of the completion of the full follow-up analysis.",
New submissions,Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry in a Rotating Universe I: Conceptual Foundations and the Dirac Field in Bianchi IX Geometry,Tatevik Vardanyan,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the highly symmetric FLRW geometry, has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations. However, it faces unresolved issues, including CMB anomalies, the nature of dark matter, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. These challenges highlight the limitations of the standard framework and raise questions about the validity of the assumed isotropic background geometry. A natural direction is to explore more general cosmological models that relax this assumption, potentially offering new insights into these problems. In this work, we examine a geometric approach to investigating the matter-antimatter asymmetry, grounded not in physics beyond the Standard Model, but in the structure of spacetime itself. While related questions have been raised previously in specific contexts, here we focus on the Bianchi IX cosmological model, motivated by its relevance to early-universe dynamics through the BKL conjecture and its potential role in generating angular momentum via global rotation. We study the Dirac spinor field in this background and derive the corresponding Dirac equation. Our goal is to investigate how spatial anisotropies and rotation can induce spectral asymmetries between particles and antiparticles. This paper lays the groundwork for a follow-up study analyzing specific solutions and their physical implications on matter-antimatter asymmetry.",
New submissions,Hidden diffeos in the Hamiltonian formulation of a background independent field theory,"J. Fernando Barbero G.,Bogar Díaz,Juan Margalef-Bentabol,Eduardo J.S. Villaseñor",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We analyze from a geometric perspective the Hamiltonian formulation of a recent modification of the Husain-Kuchař model where, while preserving the connection as a dynamical variable, the other field is restricted to be the exterior covariant derivative of a Lie algebra-valued function. We prove that 3-dimensional diffeomorphisms can be accommodated among the local gauge transformations of the model in addition to the internal gauge symmetries.",
New submissions,Dark Matter Clumps as Sources of Gravitational-Wave Glitches in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA data,"Ezequiel Alvarez,Scott Perkins,Federico Ravanedo,Nicolas Yunes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We consider the hypothetical possibility that non-stationary glitch features in the noise of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors could be produced by small dark matter clumps that pass through the earth in the vicinity of gravitational-wave detectors. We first derive the gravitational-wave strain that would be generated by the passage of such a dark matter clump. We find that the strain is primarily sourced by the Newtonian gravitational acceleration of the mirrors toward the clump and by the Shapiro time delay of the photons in the laser beams as they pass through the gravitational potential created by the dark matter clump. We also find that the Newtonian acceleration effect dominates the gravitational-wave strain for both ground and space-based interferometers. We then compare our dark matter clump, gravitational-wave strain model to 84 Koi-Fish glitches detected during the second observing run of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian analysis. We find that all glitches but 9 can be confidently rejected as having originated from dark matter clumps. For the remaining glitches, the dark matter hypothesis cannot be excluded, and the maximum \textit{a posteriori} parameters yield minimum densities of about $10^{-7} {\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^3$, within the model. These results allow us to place the first direct upper limits with gravitational-wave detectors on the local over-density of dark matter in the form of clumps in the local neighborhood of Earth, namely $\rho_{{\rm DM} \, {\rm clumps}} \lesssim 10^{-15} {\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^{-3}$.",
New submissions,All-sky search for long-duration gravitational-wave transients in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing run,"TheLIGO Scientific Collaboration, theVirgo Collaboration, theKAGRA Collaboration",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present an all-sky search for long-duration gravitational waves (GWs) from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run (O4), called O4a and comprising data taken between 24 May 2023 and 16 January 2024. The GW signals targeted by this search are the so-called ""long-duration"" (> 1 s) transients expected from a variety of astrophysical processes, including non-axisymmetric deformations in magnetars or eccentric binary coalescences. We make minimal assumptions on the emitted GW waveforms in terms of morphologies and durations. Overall, our search targets signals with durations ~1-1000 s and frequency content in the range 16-2048 Hz. In the absence of significant detections, we report the sensitivity limits of our search in terms of root-sum-square signal amplitude (hrss) of reference waveforms. These limits improve upon the results from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3) by about 30% on average. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates substantial progress in our ability to search for long-duration GW signals owing to enhancements in pipeline detection efficiencies. As detector sensitivities continue to advance and observational runs grow longer, unmodeled long-duration searches will increasingly be able to explore a range of compelling astrophysical scenarios involving neutron stars and black holes.",
New submissions,Analyzing Black-Hole Ringdowns with Orthonormal Modes,"Soichiro Morisaki,Hayato Motohashi,Motoki Suzuki,Daiki Watarai",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The ringdown signal following a BH merger can be modeled as a superposition of BH QNMs, offering a clean setup for testing gravitational theories. In particular, detecting multiple QNMs enables consistency checks of their frequencies and damping times, serving as a test of General Relativity -- a technique known as black hole spectroscopy. However, incorporating additional QNMs introduces challenges such as increased parameter correlations and higher computational costs in data analysis. To address this, we propose an efficient Bayesian analysis method that applies the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to the QNMs. This reduces the correlation between the modes and enables analytic marginalization over the mode amplitudes. We validate our approach using damped sinusoids and numerical waveforms from the SXS catalog.",
New submissions,Hawking Temperature of Massive Charged Ads Black Hole: a Topological Treatment,"Surajit Mandal,Surajit Das",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we investigate the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black hole (spherically symmetric) on the basis of a completely topological method introduced by Robson, Villari, and Biancalana (RVB). This topological method can give the exact Hawking temperature of the charged Ads black hole. We have also derived the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black hole considering massive gravity. Due to the presence of mass term in the metric function of the charged Ads black hole in massive gravity, the effect of mass term can't be neglected when calculating the Hawking temperature. In massive gravity, the accurate Hawking temperature can be obtained by including an integral constant term, which can be derived from the standard definition.",
Cross submissions,Einstein Fields: A Neural Perspective To Computational General Relativity,"Sandeep Suresh Cranganore,Andrei Bodnar,Arturs Berzins,Johannes Brandstetter",Machine Learning (cs.LG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the \emph{metric}, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are \emph{Neural Tensor Fields} with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential, including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive approaches to numerical relativity.

Tanin",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The dark matter may consist of multiple species that interact differently. We show that a species that is cosmologically subdominant but highly collisional can pile up and become dominant in deep gravitational wells, such as those of white dwarfs and neutron stars.",
Cross submissions,Testing the effective action approach to bubble nucleation in holography,"Oscar Henriksson,Niko Jokela,Xin Li",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The nucleation of bubbles during a first-order phase transition has recently been explored using holographic duality, which can provide an important complement to standard perturbative methods. These computations typically require finding static and spatially inhomogeneous saddle points, known as critical bubbles, which correspond in the gravitational dual to solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations. A computationally simpler alternative is to use the gravitational dual to derive the effective action of the boundary theory in a derivative expansion, and then solve the resulting lower-dimensional equations of motion. Once the effective action, typically truncated at two derivatives, is obtained, the holographic theory can be set aside, and bubble solutions can be found from ordinary differential equations. In this paper, we test this approach in a simple holographic setup: a probe scalar field in a black brane background with nonlinear multi-trace boundary conditions. We compute critical bubble solutions both from the effective action and by solving the full gravitational equations, and find good agreement between the two methods.",
Cross submissions,The evolution of a supermassive binary black hole in an non-spherical nuclear star cluster,"Pavel B. Ivanov,Alexander G. Polnarev",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"(abridged) We consider a secular orbital evolution of a supermassive binary black hole (SBBH) with unequal masses $M_p$ and $M_s < M_p$ in a central part of a non-spherical nuclear star cluster (NSC). When the mass of NSC inside the orbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The subsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal potential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential is mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the secular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular momentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits can experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational waves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study analytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the important effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest possible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of fast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly eccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital period. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale of the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular values of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from the ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the eccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger. It is also noted that our results can be applied to other astrophysical settings, e.g. to study the orbital evolution of a binary star or a proto planetary system inside a massive deformed gas cloud.",
Cross submissions,Pseudodifferential Weyl calculus on vector bundles,"Lars Andersson,Benjamin Moser,Marius A. Oancea,Claudio F. Paganini,Gabriel Schmid",Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"We develop a geometric framework for Weyl quantization on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, in which pseudodifferential operators act on sections of vector bundles equipped with arbitrary connections. We construct the associated star product and compute its semiclassical expansion up to third order in the expansion parameter. A central feature of our approach is a one-to-one correspondence between formally self-adjoint symbols and formally self-adjoint operators, extending known results from flat space to curved geometries. In addition, we analyze the Moyal equation satisfied by the Wigner function in this setting and provide explicit computations of Weyl symbols for several physically significant operators, including the Dirac, Maxwell, linearized Yang-Mills, and linearized Einstein operators. Our results lay the foundation for future developments in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes, semiclassical analysis, and chiral kinetic theory.",
Cross submissions,Torsion induced current-scalaron coupling in Einstein-Cartan gravity,"Minxi He,Muzi Hong,Kyohei Mukaida",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the matter current couplings with the scalar degrees of freedom originated from the torsion in Einstein-Cartan (EC) gravity. It has been shown in previous studies that the presence of the operators consisting of torsion components up to dimension four can naturally induce a (pseudo-)scalar degree of freedom, the scalaron. In this work, we consider the couplings between torsion and matter currents in this framework, and show that they can lead to couplings between these currents and the scalaron in the equivalent metric theory. We consider both gauge-invariant and gauge-dependent currents, showing general results and several concrete examples. These results are useful for the discussion of particle production processes after inflation in the EC framework, such as reheating and baryogenesis, and show the connection to the QCD $\theta$ term.",
Cross submissions,Cosmic Cartography II: completing galaxy catalogs for gravitational-wave cosmology,"Konstantin Leyde,Tessa Baker,Wolfgang Enzi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The dark siren method exploits the complementarity between gravitational-wave binary coalescence signals and galaxy catalogs originating from the same regions of space. However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation.",
Cross submissions,Quantum estimation of cosmological parameters,"Michał Piotrak,Thomas Colas,Ana Alonso-Serrano,Alessio Serafini",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the mechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the extent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we apply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the squeezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of inflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of inflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for exponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.",
Cross submissions,Exterior Generalised Geometry,"Vicente Cortés,Oskar Schiller",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It is the aim of this paper to transfer to generalised geometry tools employed in the study of semi-Riemannian immersions, specializing at times to semi-Riemannian hypersurfaces.Given an exact Courant algebroid $E \to M$ and an immersion $\iota\colon N \hookrightarrow M$, there is a well-known construction of an exact Courant algebroid $\iota^! E \to N$, the pullback of $E$. This paper explains the pullback of generalised metrics and divergence operators. Assuming $N$ is a hypersurface, it develops the notion of generalised exterior curvature, introducing the generalised second fundamental form and the generalised mean curvature. Generalised versions of the Gauß-Codazzi equations are obtained. As an application, the constraint equations for the initial value formulation of the generalised Einstein equations are established in the formalism of generalised geometry. Further applications include a generalised geometry version of the fundamental theorem for hypersurfaces and the result that generalised Kähler and hyper-Kähler structures restrict to submanifolds compatible with the generalised almost complex structure. In particular, we characterise exact semi-Riemannian Courant algebroids which are flat with respect to the canonical generalised connection. These play the role of the ambient space in the fundamental theorem mentioned above.",
Cross submissions,Bulk viscosity and $n$-component fluids,Saga Säppi,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"Understanding the hydrodynamics of out-of-equilibrium dense viscous fluids is of key importance to accurate descriptions of physical systems such as compact stars, particularly their mergers. We consider a near-equilibrium relativistic fluid with $n$ independent and small chemical potentials restoring the system back towards equilibrium. By diagonalising the evolution equation for the out-of-equilibrium chemical potentials, we construct an explicit evolution equation for the bulk scalar of the system in second-order hydrodynamics in terms of equilibrium quantities. We find expressions for the $2n$ transport quantities and show that in the rest frame of the fluid, the system admits a Green's function corresponding to an $n$-component fluid.",
Cross submissions,All-sky search for short gravitational-wave bursts in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run,"LIGO Scientific Collaboration,Virgo Collaboration,KAGRA Collaboration",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the first eight months of Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run, denoted O4a. We use four analyses which are sensitive to a wide range of potential signals lasting up to a few seconds in the 16-4096 Hz band. Excluding binary black hole merger candidates that were already identified by low-latency analyses, we find no statistically significant evidence for other gravitational-wave transients. We measure the sensitivity of the search for representative signals, including sine-Gaussians, Gaussian pulses, and white-noise bursts with different frequencies and durations, adopting a false alarm rate of 1 per 100 years as detection threshold. Depending on signal type, we find improvements over previous searches by factors of 2 to 10 in terms of sensitivity to strain amplitude and of 90% confidence upper limit on the rate density of sources. We also evaluate a variety of core-collapse supernova models and find that, for some models, the search could have detected gravitational waves from stellar core-collapse throughout the Milky Way. Finally, we consider neutron star f-modes associated with pulsar glitches and find that, assuming a source similar to the Vela Pulsar, the search could have detected a gravitational-wave signal from a glitch with fractional frequency change as small as $\sim 2$ to $6 \times 10^{-5}$ depending on the neutron star mass.",
Cross submissions,The BAO-CMB Tension and Implications for Inflation,"Elisa G. M. Ferreira,Evan McDonough,Lennart Balkenhol,Renata Kallosh,Lloyd Knox,Andrei Linde",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The scalar spectral index $n_s$ is a powerful test of inflationary models. The tightest constraint on $n_s$ to date derives from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. The resulting $n_s$ constraint is shifted significantly upward relative to the constraint from CMB alone, with the consequence that previously preferred inflationary models are seemingly disfavored by $\gtrsim 2 \sigma$. Here we show that this shift in $n_s$ is the combined effect of a degeneracy between $n_s$ and BAO parameters exhibited by CMB data and the tension between CMB datasets and DESI BAO data under the assumption of the standard cosmological model. Given the crucial role of $n_s$ in discriminating between inflationary models, we urge caution in interpreting CMB+BAO constraints on $n_s$ until the BAO-CMB tension is resolved.",
