New submissions,Hyperboloidal neutron star and black hole initial data in spherical symmetry,Alex Va침칩-Vi침uales,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The focus of this work is on the construction of initial data including a neutron star on a hyperboloidal slice. As simplest scenario for this first step, spherical symmetry is considered together with a polytropic-like equation of state for the neutron star. Constraint-satisfying hyperboloidal initial data are obtained for a single neutron star and for a combination of neutron star with a black hole in its center. To the author's best knowledge this is the first time that full hyperboloidal slices of a neutron star spacetime are constructed. The obtained initial data are suitable for evolutions of the Einstein and relativistic hydrodynamic equations on hyperboloidal slices.",
New submissions,Stringent requirements for detecting light-induced gravitational effects using interferometry,"F. Fillion-Gourdeau,S. MacLean",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Optics (physics.optics),"Intense laser fields have been proposed as a means to generate light-induced gravitational effects, providing a novel approach to investigate gravity and its coupling to electromagnetism in a controlled laboratory setting. In this article, a detection scheme based on interferometry is introduced to assess the feasibility of observing such effects. Initially, the space-time deformation and the resulting induced phase difference are evaluated in homogeneous electric fields. Using the theoretical minimum phase sensitivity bound -- a known result in quantum information -- and accounting for background signal coming from photon-photon scattering -- a fundamental quantum electrodynamics effect related to vacuum properties -- a set of stringent requirements for detectability is obtained. Then, a more realistic scenario is considered where gravitational effects are generated by an e-dipole pulse. In all cases considered, it is demonstrated that observing these effects presents significant challenges, even with the capabilities of current and foreseen laser infrastructures.",
New submissions,On the effect of the light bending phenomenon for a pulsar in a binary with a Kerr black hole,"Jyotijwal Debnath,Manjari Bagchi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"We study the effect of light-bending on the signal of a pulsar in binaries with rotating black hole companions, focusing on stellar mass black holes. We show that the impacts of various parameters on the bending delays visually match with those observed for a non-rotating black holes, because the magnitude of the spin as well as the orientation of the spin axis of the black hole introduce changes in the nanosecond order and other parameters do so in the microsecond order. Consequently, the distortion of the beam and the resulting changes in the pulse shape are minimally influenced by spin-related parameters of the black hole. We also investigate the impact of various parameters on the difference of the delays with and without the spin of the black hole and notice nanosecond scale discontinuities at orbital phases where the path of the light ray changes its direction with respect to the direction of the spin of the black hole. Moreover, as in the Schwarzschild case, the bending delays become irregular (on the microsecond scale) near the superior conjunction. We also explore the effect of bending on the pulse profiles and bending delays if the companion of the pulsar is a rotating super-massive black hole. We find significant enhancement and change in the shape of the profiles at and near the superior conjunction in comparison to stellar mass black holes. Moreover, bending delays are about three orders of magnitude higher than those in case of the stellar mass black holes.",
New submissions,"Impact of the $(\ell=2,m=0)$ spherical harmonic mode with memory on parameter estimation for ground-based detectors","Maria Rossell칩-Sastre,Sascha Husa,Sayantani Bera,Yumeng Xu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We recently presented an efficient and accurate waveform model for the $(2,0)$ spherical harmonic mode including both the displacement memory contribution and the ringdown oscillations for aligned-spin binary black holes in quasi-circular orbits. The model we developed is constructed in time domain and implemented within the computationally efficient IMRPhenomTHM waveform model. In this article, we employ it to perform in-depth parameter estimation studies for future ground-based detectors, specifically considering LIGO A$^{\#}$, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein Telescope, combining them in different detector networks. While previous studies have reviewed the impact of the memory contribution in parameter estimation, we assess the effect of incorporating the complete mode in the analysis on the posterior estimation of source parameters, performing zero-noise injections of high signal-to-noise ratio signals. We investigate the impact of this mode on the distance-inclination degeneracy and compare its impact in edge-on and face-on configurations. We find that including this mode helps mitigate biases in the estimation of individual spin components, which may otherwise arise when the mode is neglected.",
New submissions,MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity,"Gen-Liang Li,Shu-Jie Zhao,Huai-Ke Guo,Jing-Yu Su,Zhen-Heng Lin",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R < 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers.",
New submissions,Fractional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole with a fractal event horizon,"S. Jalalzadeh,H. Moradpour,G. R. Jafari,P. V. Moniz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We demonstrate that the implementation of the fractional and non-local Wheeler--DeWitt (WDW) equation within the context of Schwarzschild geometry leads to the emergence of a Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black hole (BH), which is uniquely characterized by an event horizon that exhibits fractal properties and is defined by a non-integer dimension that lies in the continuum between the values of 1 and 2. Our calculations further reveal that this intriguing fractional BH may potentially possess a temperature that is substantially lower than that of a conventional BH, thereby suggesting a significant deviation from the expected thermodynamic properties of standard BHs. These remarkable characteristics, which are intrinsically linked to the non-integer dimensionality of the event horizon, likely arise from applying the Riesz fractional derivative as a sophisticated non-local operator, thus introducing fascinating dynamics into the theoretical framework of BH physics.",
Cross submissions,Gravitomagnetism from Temporal Dimensional Reduction,"Mehran Z-Abyaneh,Mehrdad Farhoudi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose that the Taub-NUT metric can be envisaged as a (3+1) dimensional analog of the Kaluza-Klein (4+1) dimensional metric. After dimensional reduction of the Taub-NUT metric to (3) spatial dimensions, by treating time as the extra curled dimension (since the closed time-like curves can exist in the Taub-NUT framework, such a dimensional reduction is justified), we end up with three dimensional Einstein field equations plus the Maxwell equations for the gravitomagnetic field, which also acts as a source to Einstein field equations. Hence, the Taub-NUT metric unifies gravity and the NUT charge related gavitomagnetism in four dimensions, at the same footing the Kaluza-Klein metric unifies gravity and electromagnetism in five dimensions. We also find an interesting relation between the four dimensional gravitational constant and the Taub-NUT charge. The result is derived from classical field equations in Lorentzian signature.",
Cross submissions,Tidal Disruption in Topological Solitons and the Emergence of an Effective Horizon,"Pierre Heidmann,Gela Patashuri",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We compute the dynamics of particles and strings falling into smooth horizonless spacetimes that match the Schwarzschild black hole but replace its horizon with a smooth cap in supergravity. The cap consists of a regular topological structure formed by the deformations of extra compact dimensions. We show that infalling particles follow Schwarzschild-like trajectories down to the cap, but experience rapidly growing tidal forces that reach extreme values. In addition, infalling strings encounter a region of tidal instability localized at the cap, where transverse modes are excited. This stringy excitation drains their kinetic energy, resulting in tidal trapping. We demonstrate that the onset and strength of this instability depend sensitively on the Kaluza-Klein scale, the string scale, and the mass of the spacetime, ensuring that strings cannot escape the cap region. These results show that horizonless geometries can reproduce key features of black hole absorption while maintaining regularity at the horizon scale, offering compelling evidence for the emergence of effective horizon-like behavior from topological spacetime structures.",
Cross submissions,Emulating compact binary population synthesis simulations with robust uncertainty quantification and model comparison: Bayesian normalizing flows,Anarya Ray,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Machine Learning (cs.LG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.",
Cross submissions,Observational Insights on DBI K-essence Models Using Machine Learning and Bayesian Analysis,"Samit Ganguly,Arijit Panda,Eduardo Guendelman,Debashis Gangopadhyay,Abhijit Bhattacharyya,Goutam Manna",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a comparative observational data analysis of two DBI-type k-essence scalar field models for late-time cosmic acceleration: one treats dark energy with standard matter, while the other unifies dark energy and dark matter within a single scalar field, each governed by distinct non-canonical Lagrangians. The background dynamics are formulated via modified Friedmann and scalar field equations, constrained by Pantheon+ SNe Ia, Hubble, and BAO data, using Bayesian inference (NUTS in NumPyro) and a neural network-based emulator for efficiency. Introducing a nuisance parameter $\mu_0$ improves the robustness and interpretability of key cosmological parameters, particularly $H_0$, $r_d$, and $\Omega_{d0}$ by absorbing residual systematics, thereby mitigating the Hubble tension. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ is computed for both models, revealing key differences in cosmic acceleration history: Model I yields a present value $q^{Bayes}_0=-0.589$ or $q^{ML}_0=-0.559$ with transition redshift $z^{Bayes}_{trans}=0.740$ or $z^{ML}_{trans}=0.686$, closely aligning with $\Lambda$CDM predictions, while Model II shows a stronger present acceleration $q^{Bayes}_0=-0.893$ or $q^{ML}_0=-0.819$ but with a later transition at $z^{Bayes}_{trans}=0.605$ or $z^{ML}_{trans}=0.564$, indicating a steeper late time evolution. Based on $\chi^2$, $\chi^2_\nu$, AIC, and BIC statics, Model II performs worse than Model I despite its conceptual appeal. Finally, Symbolic regression (GPlearn) is performed to reconstructs $\omega_{eff}(z)$. Our analysis shows that Model I is statistically favored across all metrics and offers a physically consistent alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, capable of addressing the Hubble tension.",
Cross submissions,Exploration of features in the black hole mass spectrum inspired by non-parametric analyses of gravitational wave observations,"Stefano Rinaldi,Yajie Liang,Gabriele Demasi,Michela Mapelli,Walter Del Pozzo",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Current gravitational-wave data reveal structures in the mass function of binary compact objects. Properly modelling and deciphering such structures is the ultimate goal of gravitational-wave population analysis: in this context, non-parametric models are a powerful tool to infer the distribution of black holes from gravitational waves without committing to any specific functional form. Here, we aim to quantitatively corroborate the findings of non-parametric methods with parametrised models incorporating the features found in such analyses. We propose two modifications of the currently favoured PowerLaw+Peak model, inspired by non-parametric studies, and use them to analyse the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogue. Our analysis marginally supports the existence of two distinct, differently redshift-evolving subpopulations in the black hole primary mass function, and suggests that, to date, we are still unable to robustly assess the shape of the mass ratio distribution for symmetric ($q>0.7$) binaries.",
Cross submissions,Representing Equations of State With Strong First-Order Phase Transitions,"Lee Lindblom,Steve M. Lewis,Fridolin Weber",Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),Parametric representations of the high-density nuclear equation of state are used in constructing models for interpreting the astrophysical observations of neutron stars. This study explores how accurately equations of state with strong first-order phase transitions can be represented using spectral or piecewise analytic methods that assume no {\it{a priori}} knowledge of the location or the strength of the phase transition. The model equations of state used in this study have phase transitions strong enough to induce a gravitational instability that terminates the sequence of stable neutron stars. These equations of state also admit a second sequence of stable stars with core matter that has undergone this strong first-order phase transition (possibly driven by quark deconfinement). These results indicate that spectral representations generally achieve somewhat higher accuracy than piecewise analytic representations having the same number of parameters. Both types of representation show power-law convergence at approximately the same rate.,
