New submissions,Quantum Uncertainties of Static Spherically Symmetric Spacetimes,"Benjamin Koch,Ali Riahinia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a canonical quantization framework for static spherically symmetric spacetimes described by the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. In addition to recovering the classical Schwarzschild-(Anti)-de Sitter solutions via the Ehrenfest theorem, we investigate the quantum uncertainty relations that arise among the geometric operators in this setup. Our analysis uncovers an intriguing relation to black hole thermodynamics and opens a new angle towards generalized uncertainty relations. We further obtain an upper and a lower limit of the mass that is allowed in our model, for a given value of the cosmological constant. Both limits, when evaluated for the known value of the cosmological constant, have a stunning relation to observed bounds. These findings open a promising avenue for deeper insights into how quantum effects manifest in spacetime geometry and gravitational systems.",
New submissions,Constraining Cubic Curvature Corrections to General Relativity with Quasi-Periodic Oscillations,"Alireza Allahyari,Liang Ma,Shinji Mukohyama,Yi Pang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We investigate observational constraints on cubic curvature corrections to general relativity by analyzing quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accreting black hole systems. In particular, we study Kerr black hole solution corrected by cubic curvature terms parameterized by $\beta_5$ and $\beta_6$. While $\beta_6$ corresponds to a field-redefinition invariant structure, the $\beta_5$ term can in principle be removed via a field redefinition. Nonetheless, since we work in the frame where the accreting matter minimally couples to the metric, $\beta_5$ is in general present. Utilizing the corrected metric, we compute the QPO frequencies within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational data from GRO J1655$-$40 and a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the coupling parameters to $|\beta_5| < (27.73\,\mathrm{km})^4$ and $|\beta_6| < (15.34\,\mathrm{km})^4$. These bounds improve upon existing constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis and the speed of gravitational waves.",
New submissions,Shadow and thin accretion disk around Ayón-Beato-García black hole coupled with cloud of strings,"Ziqiang Cai,Zhenglong Ban,Lu Wang,Haiyuan Feng,Zheng-Wen Long",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate the shadow and thin accretion disk around Ayón-Beato-García (ABG) black hole (BH) coupled with a cloud of strings (CS), characterized by the nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) parameter $g$, and the CS parameter $a$. By comparing shadow diameters with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87$^{*}$ and Sgr A$^*$, we have established constraints on the BH parameters $g$ and $a$. Additionally, we analyze the BH shadow, lensing ring, and photon ring features for the ABG BH coupled with CS. Our results indicate that the shadow radius increases monotonically with the CS parameter $a$, while it decreases with increasing $g$. Finally, the study explores the physical properties and observational signatures of thin accretion disks around ABG BH with CS. The results show that an increase in parameter $g$ leads to a hotter and more luminous disk, while an increase in parameter $a$ results in a cooler and less luminous disk.",
New submissions,Spontaneous genesis of naked singularities through quantum-gravitational processes: conclusive evidence for violation of cosmic censorship,"Yang Huang,Hongsheng Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmic censorship conjecture takes a pivotal status in general relativity. We demonstrate that quantum effects, Hawking effect together with Shwinger effect inevitably lead to violation of cosmic censorship. We find that naked singularity spontaneously appears in late time evolution of an isolated large dilatonic black hole. The critical discovery is that the power of Hawking radiation converges to a finite value for an extreme dilatonic black hole, which directly exposes the singularity in finite time. The spectrum of Hawking radiation of extreme dilatonic black holes becomes a truncated shrink Planck distribution. We analyze the underlying physics of the spectrum of Hawking radiation, which roots in extraordinarily wide potential around the horizon. We study the discharge mechanism of a dilatonic black hole through Schwinger effect. Amazingly, the Schwinger pair production naturally ceases for an extreme dilatonic black hole with mass larger than $1.7\times 10^5$ solar masses. Furthermore, we show that evaporation of charged particle because of the Schwinger effect do not save the cosmic censorship for black holes heavier than $1.784\times 10^7 $ solar masses in a significant region of initial charge parameter space. For the first time, we demonstrate that the naked singularities are {\rm spontaneously} formed driven by quantum effects, such that we learn quantum gravity directly from the information shedded from the singularity.",
New submissions,Optical appearance of Schwarzschild black holes with optically thin and thick accretion disks at various inclination angles,"Jiawei Chen,Jinsong Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"In this paper, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild black hole illuminated by three geometrically thin accretion disk models under varying observational inclination angles. Based on the geometric relationship between the black hole and observer, we first divide the accretion disk into co-side and counter-side semi-disks. Subsequently, we analyze their differences in photon orbit distributions, transfer functions, and received intensities. Our results reveal distinct inclination-dependent behaviors between the two semi-disks: when the inclination approaches $\pi/2$, the co-side semi-disk develops richer ring structures with the lensed emission dominating the total brightness. Furthermore, through explicit specification of the emission profiles of the three models, we present optical images for both optically thin and thick disk scenarios at different inclinations. The results demonstrate that: (i) the bright rings in all three models become progressively compressed and deviate from circularity as inclination increases; (ii) for thick disks, partial rings are obscured and the overall intensity is lower than thin disks. These results may advance our understanding of general black hole imaging processes and provide a new approach to test gravitational theories through optical morphology studies.",
New submissions,Statistic threshold of distinguishing the environmental effects and modified theory of gravity with multiple massive black-hole binaries,Xulong Yuan,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In future space-borne \ac{GW} observations, matter arround the sources might influence the evolution and \ac{GW} signals from \ac{BBH} inspirals, which can be mistaken as deviations from \ac{GR}. Former research \cite{yuan2024} proposed a statistic $F$ that characterizes the dispersion of measured parameters to distinguish environmental effect(\ac{DF} from \ac{DM} spike) and theory of modified gravity effect(varying $G$). In this work we use the statistic to distinguish other couples of effects with \ac{GW} corrections at $-4$ PN order: \ac{DF} from \ac{DM} spike and the extra dimension theory, additionally try to determine the distinguishing threshold in more reasonable way to avoid arbitrariness, especially when the two effects to compare have more overlap in the $F$ distribution. Sources of different astronomical models are also considered, and two effects are still distinguishable but not much as in former work\cite{yuan2024}, so the threshold should be carefully selected. Following these procedures, we finally obtain the statistic thresholds of distinguishment between the three effects with \ac{GW} corrections at $-4$ PN order: \ac{DF} from \ac{DM} spike, the extra dimension theory, and varying $G$ theory. The method can be used to distinguish other effects among environmental effects and modified theories of gravity effects with the detections of \ac{GW} events.",
New submissions,Influence of external magnetic fields on charged particle motion around a Schwarzschild-like black hole,"Sojida Mannobova,Gulnisa Abdukayumova,Farruh Atamurotov,Ahmadjon Abdujabbarov,X. Gao,G. Mustafa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the dynamics of charged and neutral particles in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild-like black hole immersed in an external magnetic field. We find that the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for charged particles are systematically smaller than those of neutral particles, demonstrating a fundamental distinction in their orbital dynamics. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, charged particle ISCOs can approach arbitrarily close to the event horizon. We show that collisions between charged particles in ISCOs and neutral particles falling from infinity can produce unbounded center-of-mass energies in the strong-field regime, suggesting the black hole magnetosphere as a natural particle accelerator. Additionally, we apply the relativistic precession model to study quasi-periodic oscillations around the Schwarzschild-like black hole, treating orbital perturbations as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our results provide new insights into high-energy astrophysical processes near magnetized black holes and offer observational signatures through quasi-periodic oscillating frequencies that could be detected by current and future X-ray missions.",
New submissions,Relativistic excitation of compact stars,"Zhiqiang Miao,Xuefeng Feng,Zhen Pan,Huan Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we study the excitation of a compact star under the influence of external gravitational driving in the relativistic regime. Using a model setup in which a wave with constant frequency is injected from past null infinity and scattered by the star to future null infinity, we show that the scattering coefficient encodes rich information of the star. For example, the analytical structure of the scattering coefficient implies that the decay rate of a mode generally plays the role of ``star excitation factor'', similar to the ``black hole excitation factor'' previously defined for describing black hole mode excitations. With this star excitation factor we derive the transient mode excitation as a binary system crosses a generic mode resonance of a companion star during the inspiral stage. This application is useful because previous description of resonant mode excitation of stars still relies on the mode and driving force decomposition based on the Newtonian formalism. In addition, we show that the scattering phase is intimately related to the total energy of spacetime and matter under the driving of a steady input wave from infinity. We also derive the relevant tidal energy of a star under steady driving and compare that with the dynamic tide formula. We estimate that the difference may lead to $\mathcal{O}(0.5)$ radian phase modulation in the late stage of the binary neutron star inspiral waveform.",
New submissions,Measurements in stochastic gravity and thermal variance,"Markus B. Fröb,Dražen Glavan,Paolo Meda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We analyze the thermal fluctuations of a free, conformally invariant, Maxwell quantum field (photon) interacting with a cosmological background spacetime, in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and semiclassical and stochastic gravity. The thermal fluctuations give rise to backreaction effects upon the spacetime geometry, which are incorporated in the semiclassical Einstein-Langevin equation, evaluated in the cosmological Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We first evaluate the semiclassical Einstein equation for the background geometry sourced by the thermal quantum stress-energy tensor. For large enough temperature, the solution is approximated by a radiation-dominated expanding universe driven by the thermal bath of photons. We then evaluate the thermal noise kernel associated to the quantum fluctuations of the photon field using point-splitting regularization methods, and give its explicit analytic form in the limits of large and small temperature, as well as a local approximation. Finally, we prove that this thermal noise kernel corresponds exactly to the thermal variance of the induced fluctuations of the linearized metric perturbation in the local and covariant measurement scheme defined by Fewster and Verch. Our analysis allows to quantify the extent to which quantum fluctuations may give rise to non-classical effects, and thus become relevant in inflationary cosmology.",
New submissions,"Helically twisted spacetime: study of geometric and wave optics, and physical analysis","Edilberto O. Silva,Frankbelson dos S. Azevedo,Faizuddin Ahmed",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyse a stationary, cylindrically symmetric spacetime endowed with an intrinsic helical twist, $ds^{2} = -dt^{2} + dr^{2} + r^{2} d\phi^{2} + (dz + \omega\, r\,d\phi)^{2}$. Solving the Einstein equations exactly yields an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor whose density is negative and decays as $r^{-2}$, thus violating the weak energy condition near the axis. Three notable features emerge: (i) axis-centred negative energy; (ii) unequal transverse stresses; (iii) a torsional momentum flux $T_{\phi z}\omega^{3}/r$. We identify stable photon orbits and deflection angle, fully helical geodesics, and torsion-controlled wave optics modes, suggesting laboratory analogues in twisted liquid-crystal and photonic systems. The coupling between the torsion parameter $\omega$ and other physical parameters leads to significant effects, altering the motion along the positive or negative $z$-axis. These results make the twisted helical metric a useful test bed for studying the interplay of curvature, torsion, and matter in both gravitational and condensed-matter contexts.",
New submissions,From new physics to a running power law and back again: Minimal refitting techniques for the reconstruction of the gravitational-wave background signal in pulsar timing array data,"David Esmyol,Antonio J. Iovino,Kai Schmitz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations recently presented evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies. In this paper, we introduce new refitting techniques for PTA data analysis that elevate related techniques in the literature to a more rigorous level and thus provide the basis for fast and accurate Bayesian inference and physically intuitive model comparisons. The key idea behind our approach is to construct maps \Phi from GWB spectral models to a running-power-law (RPL) reference model, such that the pullback \Phi^* P_RPL of the RPL posterior density P_RPL induces a likelihood on the GWB model parameter space; in other words, we refit spectral models to the RPL posterior density. In order to construct \Phi, we introduce a matched-filtering approach in which \Phi follows from a \chi^2 minimization that accounts for the frequency dependence of PTA sensitivity curves. We validate and illustrate our techniques by three concrete examples: GWs from stable cosmic strings, GWs from metastable strings, and scalar-induced GWs.",
New submissions,Searching for quasinormal modes from Binary Black Hole mergers,"A. Królak,O. Dorosh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.",
New submissions,Thermodynamic Curvature and Topological Insights of Hayward Black Holes with String Fluids,"Ankit Anand,Saeed Noori Gashti,Aditya Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we study the influence of string fluids on the extended thermodynamic structure and microscopic interactions of Hayward black holes by employing thermodynamic geometry as an empirical tool. Using the novel equation of state obtained for regular black holes surrounded by string fluids, we analyze the extended phase space with enthalpy as the central thermodynamic potential. By examining the behavior of the normalized Ruppeiner curvature scalar $R_N$ in the temperature-volume $(T,V)$ plane, we analyzed the influence of the string fluid parameters on the microstructure of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the presence of string fluids significantly modifies the dominant microscopic interactions, transitioning from attractive to repulsive regimes depending on the charge and volume of the black hole. We see that the thermodynamic curvature effectively detects critical points and phase transitions, reflecting the nature of repulsive or attractive interactions among black hole microstructures. We further investigate thermodynamic topology to provide a novel classification scheme for stability and phase behavior, delineating local stable and unstable regions in parameter space. We investigate the thermodynamic topology of Hayward-AdS black holes surrounded by string fluids, showing that the number and type of topological charges depend on the parameters $\epsilon$ and $b$, revealing phase transitions and stability characteristics encoded in the global topological charge $W$. This integrated study of the thermodynamic geometry and topology structure enhances the understanding of Hayward black holes surrounded by string fluids, showing overall thermodynamic stability and configuration with significant implications for holographic duality and potential astrophysical observations.",
Cross submissions,Cosmological solutions from 5D $N=4$ matter-coupled supergravity,H. L. Dao,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"From five-dimensional $N=4$ matter-coupled gauged supergravity, smooth time-dependent cosmological solutions, connecting a $dS_{5-d}\times H^d$ (with $d=2,3$) spacetime at early times to a $dS_5$ spacetime at late times, are presented. The solutions are derived from the second-order equations of motion arising from all the gauged theories that can admit $dS_5$ solutions. There are eight such theories constructed from gauge groups of the form $SO(1,1)\times G_{nc}$ and $SO(1,1)^{(n)}_\text{diag}\times G_{nc}$, with $n=2,3$, where $G_{nc}$ is a non-compact gauge factor whose compact part must be embedded entirely in the matter symmetry group of 5D matter-coupled supergravity. Furthermore, we analyze how the cosmological solutions and their corresponding $dS_5$ vacua cannot arise from the first-order equations that solve the second-order field equations.",
Cross submissions,A comprehensive numerical study on four categories of holographic dark energy models,"Jun-Xian Li,Shuang Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Holographic dark energy (HDE), which arises from a theoretical attempt to apply the holographic principle (HP) to the dark energy (DE) problem, has attracted significant attention over the past two decades. We perform a comprehensive numerical study on HDE models that can be classified into four categories: 1) HDE models with other characteristic length scale, 2) HDE models with extended Hubble scale, 3) HDE models with dark sector interaction, 4) HDE models with modified black hole entropy. For theoretical models, we select seven representative models, including the original HDE (OHDE) model, Ricci HDE (RDE) model, generalized Ricci HDE (GRDE) model, interacting HDE (IHDE1 and IHDE2) models, Tsallis HDE (THDE) model, and Barrow HDE (BHDE) model. For cosmological data, we use the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 measurements, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors data from the Planck 2018, and the type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the PantheonPlus compilation. Using $\chi^2$ statistic and Bayesian evidence, we compare these HDE models with current observational data. It is found that: 1) The $\Lambda$CDM remains the most competitive model, while the RDE model is ruled out. 2) HDE models with dark sector interaction perform the worst across the four categories, indicating that the interaction term is not favored under the framework of HDE. 3) The other three categories show comparable performance. The OHDE model performs better in the BAO+CMB dataset, and the HDE models with modified black hole entropy perform better in the BAO+CMB+SN dataset. 4) HDE models with the future event horizon exhibit significant discrepancies in parameter space across datasets. The BAO+CMB dataset favors a phantom-like HDE, whereas the BAO+CMB+SN leads to an equation of state (EoS) much closer to the cosmological constant.",
Cross submissions,Exploring the parameter space of hierarchical triple black hole systems,"M. Attia,Y. Sibony",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a comprehensive exploration of hierarchical triple black hole (BH) systems to address the ""initial separation"" problem in gravitational wave astrophysics. This problem arises because isolated BH binaries must have extremely small initial separations to merge within a Hubble time via gravitational wave (GW) emission alone, separations at which their stellar progenitors would have merged prematurely. Using a modified JADE secular code incorporating GW energy loss, we systematically investigate a seven-dimensional parameter space: masses of three BHs (5-100 $M_\odot$ inner binary, 1-200 $M_\odot$ tertiary), inner/outer semimajor axes (1-200 AU and 100-10,000 AU), outer orbit eccentricity (0-0.9), and mutual inclination (40°-80°). We employed an adaptive MCMC approach sampling the merger/nonmerger transition boundary across nearly 15 million simulations. Results reveal merger-conducive regions correspond to asymmetric inner binary masses, large inner separations where von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism operates effectively without relativistic precession suppression, small outer separations providing stronger perturbations, and large outer eccentricities bringing the tertiary closer at pericenter. Merger probability correlates positively with mutual inclination. We developed a classification scheme for nonmerging systems based on GW emission and ZLK oscillations. A trained neural network predicts merger outcomes with 99% ROC score and 95% accuracy (99.7% for high-confidence predictions), enabling rapid population synthesis. Validation against N-body integrations showed 87% qualitative agreement, confirming our methodology captures essential triple BH dynamics while enabling unprecedented-scale exploration of configurations resolving the initial separation problem.",
Cross submissions,Simulation-based population inference of LISA's Galactic binaries: Bypassing the global fit,"Rahul Srinivasan,Enrico Barausse,Natalia Korsakova,Roberto Trotta",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect thousands of individually resolved gravitational wave sources, overlapping in time and frequency, on top of unresolved astrophysical and/or primordial backgrounds. Disentangling resolved sources from backgrounds and extracting their parameters in a computationally intensive ""global fit"" is normally regarded as a necessary step toward reconstructing the properties of the underlying astrophysical populations. Here, we show that it is possible to infer the properties of the most numerous population of LISA sources - Galactic double white dwarfs - directly from the frequency (or, equivalently, time) strain series, by using a simulation-based approach that bypasses the global fit entirely. By training a normalizing flow on a custom-designed compression of simulated LISA frequency series from the Galactic double white dwarf population, we demonstrate how to infer the posterior distribution of population parameters (e.g., mass function, frequency, and spatial distributions). This allows for extracting information on the population parameters from both resolved and unresolved sources simultaneously and in a computationally efficient manner. Our approach to target population properties directly can be readily extended to other source classes (e.g., massive and stellar-mass black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals), provided fast simulations are available, and to scenarios involving non-Gaussian or non-stationary noise (e.g., data gaps).",
Cross submissions,Probing Binary Neutron Star Merger Ejecta and Remnants with Gravitational Wave and Radio Observations,"Kara Merfeld(JHU),Alessandra Corsi(JHU)",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a study aimed at quantifying the detectability of radio counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with total masses $\lesssim 3$\,M$_{\odot}$, which may form neutron star (NS) remnants. We focus on mergers localized by gravitational-wave (GW) observations to sky areas $\lesssim 10$\,deg$^2$, a precision that greatly facilitates optical counterpart identification and enables radio discovery even without detections at other wavelengths. Widely separated GW detectors are essential for building samples of well-localized BNS mergers accessible to US-based radio telescopes, with minimum yearly detection rates (assuming the smallest values of the BNS local merger rate) ranging from a few with current GW detectors to hundreds with next-generation GW instruments. Current GW networks limit well-localized detections to $z\lesssim 0.2$, while next-generation GW detectors extend the reach to $z\lesssim 0.8$, encompassing the median redshift of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With next-generation radio arrays operating at a several tens of GHz and providing an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the most sensitive ones available today, short GRB-like jet afterglows can be detected for a large fraction of the considered BNS mergers. At lower radio frequencies, detections with current radio interferometric arrays are feasible, though subject to synchrotron self-absorption effects. The enhanced sensitivity and survey speed of future radio interferometers operating at a few GHz, combined with the higher detection rate of well-localized BNSs enabled by next-generation GW observatories, are key to probing disk-wind and dynamical ejecta afterglows, as well as remnant diversity.",
Cross submissions,Quantum Gravity Corrections to the Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Near-Extremal Reissener-Nordström Black Holes,"Zheng Jiang,Jun Nian,Caiying Shao,Yu Tian,Hongbao Zhang",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate quantum corrections to scalar quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole background with quantum correction in the near-horizon AdS$_2\times \mathrm{S}^2$ region. By performing a dimensional reduction, we obtain an effective Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity theory, whose quantum fluctuations are captured by the Schwarzian action. Using path integral techniques, we derive the quantum-corrected scalar field equation, which modifies the effective potential governing the QNMs. These corrections are extended from the near-horizon region to the full spacetime via a matching procedure. We compute the corrected QNMs using both the third-order WKB method and the Prony method and find consistent results. Our analysis reveals that quantum corrections can lead to substantial shifts in the real parts of QNM frequencies, particularly for small-mass or near-extremal black holes, while the imaginary parts remain relatively stable. This suggests that quantum gravity effects may leave observable imprints on black hole perturbation spectra, which could be potentially relevant for primordial or microscopic black holes.",
Cross submissions,A unified origin for dark energy and resonant dark matter from strongly-coupled gauge theory,Martin Drobczyk,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that a single strongly coupled gauge theory naturally gives rise to a unified description of the dark sector, simultaneously addressing the origin of dark energy at the meV scale and self-interacting dark matter at the TeV scale. Building on the density-responsive scalar field framework that resolves cosmological singularities and generates dark energy without fine-tuning, we show that the same underlying SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f = 10$ flavors predicts complete dark matter phenomenology. The theory generates not only the required anomalous dimension $\gamma \approx 0.50\pm0.05$ for the dark-energy mechanism, but also produces a composite particle spectrum featuring a TeV-scale dark matter candidate ($m_\chi \approx 600$~GeV) and a heavier scalar meson. Remarkably, the mass ratio $m_{\Phi_h}/m_\chi \approx 2$ naturally emerges from the dynamics of confinement, without any fine-tuning. This resonance condition, which initially appears as a coincidence, is revealed to be a robust prediction of the gauge dynamics, completely resolving the long-standing tension between achieving the correct relic abundance and solving small-scale structure problems through self-interactions. The framework makes sharp, testable predictions: a narrow scalar resonance at $\sim 1.2$~TeV accessible at HL-LHC, dark matter self-interactions of $\sigma_T/m \sim 1$~cm$^2$/g at dwarf galaxy velocities, and a stochastic gravitational wave background from the confinement phase transition. By deriving both dark energy and dark matter from a single microscopic theory, our work demonstrates how 95\% of the universe's energy content can emerge from one underlying strongly-coupled gauge theory, providing a complete and predictive framework for dark sector physics across 15 orders of magnitude in energy.",
Cross submissions,Effects of Large Optical Depth on CD HI 21-cm Non-Gaussian Signal,"Iffat Nasreen,Kanan K. Datta,Abinash K. Shaw,Leon Noble,Raghunath Ghara,Sk. Saiyad Ali,Arnab Mishra,Mohd Kamran,Suman Majumdar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"During the Cosmic Dawn (CD), the HI 21-cm optical depth ($\tau$ ) in the intergalactic medium can become significantly large. Consequently, the second and higher-order terms of $\tau$ appearing in the Taylor expansion of the HI 21-cm differential brightness temperature ($\delta T_{\rm b}$ ) become important. This introduces additional non-Gaussianity into the signal. We study the impact of large $\tau$ on statistical quantities of HI 21-cm signal using a suite of standard numerical simulations that vary X-ray heating efficiency and the minimum halo mass required to host radiation sources. We find that the higher order terms suppress statistical quantities such as skewness, power-spectrum and bispectrum. However, the effect is found to be particularly strong on the non-Gaussian signal. We find that the change in skewness can reach several hundred percent in low X-ray heating scenarios. For moderate and high X-ray heating models changes are around $\sim40\%$ and $60\%$, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{9}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. This change is around $\sim 75\%$, $25\%$ and $20\%$ for low, moderate and high X-ray heating models, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. The change in bispectrum in both the halo cutoff mass scenarios ranges from $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 300\%$ for low X-ray heating model. However, for moderate and high X-ray heating models the change remains between $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 200\%$ for both equilateral and squeezed limit triangle configuration. Finally, we find that up to third orders of $\tau$ need to be retained to accurately model $\delta T_{\rm b}$, especially for capturing the non-Gaussian features in the HI 21-cm signal.",
Cross submissions,Generating Moving Field Initial Conditions with Spatially Varying Boost,Siyang Ling,Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We introduce a novel class of algorithms, the ``spatially varying boost'', for generating dynamical field initial conditions with prescribed bulk velocities. Given (non-moving) initial field data, the algorithm generates new initial data with the given velocity profile by performing local Lorentz boosts. This algorithm is generic, with no restriction on the type of the field, the equation of motion, and can endow fields with ultra-relativistic velocities. This algorithm enables new simulations in different branches of physics, including cosmology and condensed matter physics. For demonstration, we used this algorithm to (1) boost two Sine-Gordon solitons to ultra-relativistic speeds for subsequent collision, (2) generate a relativistic transverse Proca field with random velocities, and (3) set up a spin-$1$ Schrödinger-Poisson field with velocity and density perturbations consistent with dark matter in matter dominated universe.",
Cross submissions,ACT DR6 Leads to Stronger Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter,"Deng Wang,Kazuharu Bamba",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Dark matter is fundamental to the composition, structure, and evolution of the universe. Combining the ACT's cosmic microwave background, DESI's baryon acoustic oscillations with DESY5 type Ia supernova observations, we find a $3.4\,\sigma$ evidence for dynamical dark matter (DDM) with an equation of state, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm0}+\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Independent of the Planck measurements, the ACT data confirms the linear relation $\omega_{dma}=-\omega_{dm0}$, inducing that the equation of state of dark matter is directly proportional to the scale factor $a$. Furthermore, the effects of DDM on the large-scale structure observables are thoroughly studied. Our findings are of great significance for understanding cosmic acceleration, structure growth, and the fate of the universe.",
Cross submissions,Search for Higher Harmonic Signals from Close White Dwarf Binaries in the mHz Band,Naoki Seto,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as LISA, are expected to detect thousands of Galactic close white dwarf binaries emitting nearly monochromatic GWs. In this study, we demonstrate that LISA is reasonably likely to detect higher harmonic GW signals, particularly the $(l, |m|) = (3, 3)$ mode, from a limited sample of nearby close white dwarf binaries, even with small orbital velocities $v/c$ of order $10^{-3}$. The amplitudes of these post-Newtonian modes provide robust probes of mass asymmetry in such systems, making them valuable observational targets, especially in mass-transferring binaries. Long-term, coordinated detector operations will further improve the prospects for detecting these informative signals.",
Cross submissions,Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation,"Teruyuki Kitabayashi,Aya Shimizu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.",
Cross submissions,Relational entanglement entropies and quantum reference frames in gauge theories,"Goncalo Araujo-Regado,Philipp A. Hoehn,Francesco Sartini",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"It has been shown that defining gravitational entanglement entropies relative to quantum reference frames (QRFs) intrinsically regularizes them. Here, we demonstrate that such relational definitions also have an advantage in lattice gauge theories, where no ultraviolet divergences occur. To this end, we introduce QRFs for the gauge group via Wilson lines on a lattice with global boundary, realizing edge modes on the bulk entangling surface. Overcoming challenges of previous nonrelational approaches, we show that defining gauge-invariant subsystems associated with subregions relative to such QRFs naturally leads to a factorization across the surface, yielding distillable relational entanglement entropies. Distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic QRFs, according to whether they are built from the region or its complement, leads to extrinsic and intrinsic relational algebras ascribed to the region. The ""electric center algebra"" of previous approaches is recovered as the algebra that all extrinsic QRFs agree on, or by incoherently twirling any extrinsic algebra over the electric corner symmetry group. Similarly, a generalization of previous proposals for a ""magnetic center algebra"" is obtained as the algebra that all intrinsic QRFs agree on, or, in the Abelian case, by incoherently twirling any intrinsic algebra over a dual magnetic corner group. Altogether, this leads to a compelling regional algebra and relative entropy hierarchy. Invoking the corner twirls, we also find that the extrinsic/intrinsic relational entanglement entropies are upper bounded by the non-distillable electric/magnetic center entropies. Finally, using extrinsic QRFs, we discuss the influence of ""asymptotic"" symmetries on regional entropies. Our work thus unifies and extends previous approaches and reveals the interplay between entropies and regional symmetry structures.",
Cross submissions,Scalar-induced gravitational waves from coherent initial states,"Dipayan Mukherjee,H. V. Ragavendra,Shiv K. Sethi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the impact of statistical inhomogeneity and anisotropy in primordial scalar perturbations on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). Assuming inflationary quantum fluctuations originate from a coherent state, the resulting primordial scalar perturbations acquire a non-zero space-dependent mean, violating statistical homogeneity, statistical isotropy, and parity. As a consequence of statistical inhomogeneities, SIGW acquires distinct scale-dependent features in its correlation function. Statistical anisotropies further lead to possible parity violation and correlation between different polarization modes in the tensor perturbations. Therefore, detection of these signatures in the stochastic gravitational wave background would offer probes to the statistical nature of primordial scalar perturbations beyond the scales accessible to CMB observations.",
Cross submissions,Neutrino oscillations in the Ellis wormhole spacetime,"Ya-Ru Wang,Shu-Jun Rong",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to probe compact astrophysical objects and the distribution of dark matter at large scales. As a counterpart of photons, lensed relativistic neutrinos could also be used to explore properties of curved spacetimes. In the present paper we consider neutrino oscillations in the Ellis wormhole (WH) spacetime in comparison with the widely discussed black hole (BH) spacetimes. We investigate the oscillations involving lensing effects with 2- and 3-flavor neutrinos under the weak-field approximation. In the two-flavor model, the flavor oscillation probabilities display the impacts of the throat radius, neutrino mass hierarchy, and the lightest neutrino mass. In the realistic 3-flavor case, the similar observations are obtained with the up-to-date global fit data of neutrino experiments. The influence of the Ellis WH on the coherence of neutrinos is also studied in the paper. In general, the observations from neutrino oscillations cannot be used to discriminate Ellis WH spacetimes from typical BH spacetimes under the weak-field limit.",
Cross submissions,Sagittarius A* near-infrared flares polarization as a probe of space-time I: Non-rotating exotic compact objects,"Nicolas Aimar,João Luís Rosa,Hanna Liis Tamm,Paulo Garcia",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius~A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the Schwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.",
