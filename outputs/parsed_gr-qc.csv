New submissions,Investigating Strange Stars in Rastall Theory,"Malick Sallah,M. Sharif",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study explores the structural formation of various spherically symmetric anisotropic stars within the framework of Rastall theory. To achieve this, we derive modified field equations which are then resolved using the Finch-Skea ansatz, which involve unknown parameters $(A_1,A_2,A_3)$. These parameters are found by using appropriate constraints given by the junction conditions, in addition to observational data from some selected stars. The $\mathbb{EOS}$ given by the $\mathbb{MIT}$ bag model is employed to examine the interior structure and various physical properties of these compact objects. For calculated values of the bag constant $\mathcal{B}$ and two values of the Rastall parameter, $\xi = 0.3, 0.5$, we investigate the regularity and viability of the state variables. Additionally, we analyze stability of the developed model by employing three distinct criteria. We find that the obtained model is stable and provides an accurate approximation for the mass and radius of strange stars when the Rastall parameter $\xi = 0.3$ is considered.",
New submissions,Cascade Relaxation of the Gravitating Vacuum as a Generator of the Evolving Universe,"V. N. Lukash(Astro Space Center, P. N. Lebedev Physical Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia),E. V. Mikheeva(Astro Space Center, P. N. Lebedev Physical Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The cascade relaxation of a polarized vacuum in the expanding Universe is a chain of evolutionary epochs of decreasing its density with the exit of dominant fields (each in its own time) from the initial zero states to nonzero values, from the dominant scalar field in the early Universe to subsequent ones, including the $\Lambda$-term in the modern Universe. The cascade vacuum relaxation creates the entire observable cosmology from the Friedmann model with small perturbations of the metric with non-power-law power spectra from which primordial black holes could have arisen, and gravitational waves over a wide wavenumber range to the formation of dark matter and energy, early galaxies, supermassive black holes, and the large-scale structure of the Universe. An observational model of cascade vacuum relaxation in the early Universe has been build, which contains two constants determined by observational data and does not require information on the potential of the fields. A solution has been obtained for the general relativity vacuum attractor, including, in addition to the two previously mentioned constants, the third constant (not yet limited by observations), which leads to an additional power of density perturbations on a small scale ($k>10\,$Mpc$^{-1}$) in the form of a ``bump'', a two-power-law spectrum, etc.",
New submissions,Could Planck Star Remnants be Dark Matter?,"Oem Trivedi,Abraham Loeb",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore the end state of gravitational collapse under quantum gravity effects and propose that Planck Star Remnants (PSR), formed via nonsingular bounces, could serve as viable dark matter candidates. Within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we model the collapse of a homogeneous matter distribution and show that the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce at the Planck density. By analytically matching the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) interior to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime using the Israel junction conditions, we demonstrate that the bounce remains causally hidden from external observers, avoiding any observable re-expansion. This naturally leads to the formation of stable, non-radiating PSR, whose radius coincides with the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole mass approaches the Planck mass as a result of Hawking evaporation. We suggest that such remnants may originate from evaporating primordial black holes in the early universe, and estimate the relic abundance needed for PSR to account for the observed dark matter density. We also discuss some crucial differences between PSR and previous proposals of Planck mass relics. The scenario is shown to be consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological constraints, offering a unified framework connecting quantum gravitational collapse, and the nature of dark matter.",
New submissions,Eye of the vortex: bound spectra in tunable horizonless rotational analogs,"H. S. Vieira,Kyriakos Destounis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the bound spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we utilize an analog vortex endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the spacetime of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon--characteristic of an acoustic black hole--for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the latter case, where the vortex flow is purely rotational, and compute the spectral properties of the analog system. The resulting bound-state spectrum is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of superfluid Helium giant quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime geometry used here holds significant potential to replicate the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the physical topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.",
New submissions,Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection,"Ismael Ayuso,Mariam Bouhmadi-LÃ³pez,Che-Yu Chen,Xiao Yan Chew,Konstantinos Dialektopoulos,Yen Chin Ong",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.",
New submissions,Study of Complexity Factor and Stability of Dynamical Systems in $f(G)$ Gravity,"M. Zeeshan Gul,W. Ahmad,M.M.M. Nasir,Faisal Javed,Orhan Donmez,Bander Almutairi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we evaluate the complexity of the non-static cylindrical geometry with anisotropic matter configuration in the framework of modified Gauss-Bonnet theory. In this perspective, we calculate modified field equations, the C energy formula, and the mass function that helps to understand the astrophysical structures in this modified gravity. Furthermore, we use the Weyl tensor and obtain different structure scalars by orthogonally splitting the Riemann tensor. One of these scalars, $YTF$ is referred to as the complexity factor. This parameter measures the system's complexity due to non-uniform energy density and non-isotropic pressure. We select the identical complexity factor for the structure as used in the non-static scenario while considering the analogous criterion for the most elementary pattern of development. This technique involves formulating structural scalars that illustrate the fundamental features of the system. A fluid distribution that satisfies the vanishing complexity requirement and evolves homologously is characterized as isotropic, geodesic, homogeneous, and shear-free. In the dissipative scenario, the fluid remains geodesic while exhibiting shear, resulting in an extensive array of solutions.",
New submissions,Axial quasi-normal modes of slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity to second-order in spin and coupling,"Tharaka Alapati,S. Shankaranarayanan(IIT Bombay)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We compute the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies of slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, including corrections up to second order in the black hole's dimensionless spin parameter ($\chi$) and second order in the dCS coupling parameter ($\alpha$). Due to the complexities of constructing a Newman-Penrose tetrad at this order, we employ a metric perturbation approach. We derive a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the primary axial $l$-mode and the polar $l\pm 1$ modes, which is then solved numerically with appropriate ingoing and outgoing wave boundary conditions. Our numerical framework is validated in the General Relativistic limit against known Schwarzschild QNMs and highly accurate Kerr QNM results for $\chi \leq 0.15$. For the fundamental $n=0, l=m=2$ axial mode, we present detailed numerical results illustrating the dependence of QNM frequencies on both $\chi$ and $\alpha$. We observe that while rotation generally increases the damping time, increasing the dCS coupling parameter significantly reduces the damping time of the axial mode. This finding contrasts with previous analytical work on polar modes, which suggested an increase in damping time due to dCS effects, highlighting a crucial parity-dependent difference in how dCS gravity impacts black hole ringdowns. Furthermore, we provide an analytical fitting formula for this mode. These results, incorporating coupled spin and dCS effects at second order, provide more accurate theoretical predictions for testing dCS gravity with gravitational wave observations of black hole ringdowns. The refined QNM calculations are particularly relevant for lower-mass black hole merger events, such as GW230529, where dCS corrections may be more prominent and their distinct damping signatures could be observable.

New submissions,Experimental Exclusion of Planetary Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers,"William M. Campbell,Leonardo Mariani,Michael E. Tobar,Maxim Goryachev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The multi-mode acoustic gravitational wave experiment (MAGE) is a high-frequency gravitational wave detection experiment featuring cryogenic quartz bulk acoustic wave resonators operating as sensitive strain antennas in the MHz regime. After 61 days of non-continuous data collection, we present bounds on the observable merger rate density of primordial black hole binary systems of chirp mass $1.2\times10^{-4}M_\odot<\mathcal{M}<1.7\times10^{-9}M_\odot$. The maximum achieved limit on the merger rate density is $\mathcal{R}>1.3\times10^{18}~\mathrm{kpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ which corresponds to constraining yearly mergers to a distance of reach on the order of the solar system, or $1.0\times10^{-6}$ kpc during the observational period. In addition, we exclude significantly rare and strong events similar to those observed in previous predecessor experiments as non-gravitational background signals, utilising coincident analysis between multiple detectors.",
New submissions,External Attention Transformer: A Robust AI Model for Identifying Initial Eccentricity Signatures in Binary Black Hole Events in Simulated Advanced LIGO Data,"Elahe Khalouei,Cristiano G. Sabiu,Hyung Mok Lee,A. Gopakumar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Initial orbital eccentricities of gravitational wave (GW) events associated with merging binary black holes (BBHs) should provide clues to their formation scenarios, mainly because various BBH formation channels predict distinct eccentricity distributions. However, searching for inspiral GWs from eccentric BBHs is computationally challenging due to sophisticated approaches to model such GW events. This ensures that Bayesian parameter estimation methods to characterize such events are computationally daunting. These considerations influenced us to propose a novel approach to identify and characterize eccentric BBH events in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration data sets that leverages external attention transformer models. Employing simulated data that mimic LIGO O4 run, eccentric inspiral events modeled by an effective-one-body numerical-relativity waveform family, we show the effectiveness of our approach. By integrating this transformer-based framework with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, we provide efficient way to identify eccentric BBH GW events and accurately characterize their source properties.",
New submissions,Universal thermodynamic topological classes of static black holes in Conformal Killing Gravity,"Hao Chen,Di Wu,Meng-Yao Zhang,Soroush Zare,Hassan Hassanabadi,Bekir Can LÃ¼tfÃ¼oÄlu,Zheng-Wen Long",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we develop a universal thermodynamic topological classes for the static black holes in the context of the Conformal Killing Gravity. Our findings indicate that the Conformal Killing Gravity significantly reconstructs the thermodynamic properties of both the smallest inner black hole state and the largest outer black hole state. Additionally, it considerably alters the thermodynamic stability of black holes across both high-temperature and low-temperature regimes. This analysis shows that different CKG parameter settings will lead to $W^{0+}$ $(\lambda>0)$ and $W^{1+}$ $(\lambda<0)$ classes of the charged AdS black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black hole in Conformal Killing Gravity is classified into the $W^{0+}$ and $W^{1+}$ categories. Furthermore, we examine the specific scenario where charge is neglected. The study reveals that within the framework of Conformal Killing Gravity, the Schwarzschild black hole similar to the Schwarzschild AdS black hole, can be classified into the $W^{1-}$ and $W^{0-}$ categories. This work provides key insights into the fundamental nature of quantum gravity theory.",
New submissions,Gravitational Collapse: Generalizing Oppenheimer-Snyder and a Conjecture on Horizon Formation Time,"H. Khodabakhshi,H. Lu,F. Shojai",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We generalize the Oppenheimer-Snyder model of gravitational collapse by considering a broader class of static, spherically symmetric exterior spacetimes, with an interior geometry described by a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry. Using Painleve-Gullstrand (PG) coordinates for the spatially flat interior geometry (k=0) and a Novikov-like coordinate system for the spatially closed geometry (k=1), we ensured a smooth transition between the interior and exterior of the collapsing star. By providing general formulas, we analyzed how apparent and event horizons form during the collapse and checked whether the matter satisfies standard energy conditions. For both k=0 and k=1 cases, we studied explicit examples such as Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-AdS/dS, and Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black holes, taking into account the effects of the cosmological constant and electric charge. These factors significantly influence the collapse process and can impose constraints on the physical parameters. Our analysis leads to two important results: First, to form a black hole, there is a minimum or critical initial radius for the star to begin collapsing. Second, we propose a conjecture of an inequality regarding the event horizon formation time, starting from the critical radius, namely Delta T_eh <= 19M/6. The upper bound is saturated by the Schwarzschild black hole.",
New submissions,Cosmological Dynamics of Accelerating Model in $f(T)$ Gravity with Special Form of Deceleration Parameter,"Shivank Pal,Romanshu Garg,Gyan Prakash Singh,Gauree Shanker",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, the dynamical behavior of the accelerated expansion of the universe is discussed within the framework of $f(T)$ gravity for a particular form of $ f(T)=\alpha (-T)^{n}$. Considering a redshift-dependent parameterization of the deceleration parameter as $q(z)=q_{0}+ q_{1}\left(\frac{ \ln(N+z)}{z+1}-\ln N \right)$. We have derived the Hubble parameter in terms of redshift and discussed its effect on other cosmological parameters. Using Bayesian statistical analysis and $\chi^2$-minimization, the median values of the model parameters for both the cosmic chronometer and the combined (CC + Pantheon) dataset have been determined. Further, energy density, pressure, the equation of state for Dark Energy and statefinder diagnostics are analyzed. The current age of the universe is also computed for this model.",
New submissions,Quantum entanglement in cosmology,"Alessio Belfiglio,Orlando Luongo,Stefano Mancini",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We discuss recent progress in the study of entanglement within cosmological frameworks, focusing on both momentum and position-space approaches and also reviewing the possibility to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields. Entanglement generation in expanding spacetimes can be traced back to the phenomenon of gravitational particle production, according to which the background gravitational field may transfer energy and momentum to quantum fields. The corresponding entanglement amount and its mode dependence are both sensitive to the field statistics and to the details of spacetime expansion, thus encoding information about the background. Gravitational production processes also play a key role in addressing the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological perturbations. In order to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields, local interactions with additional quantum systems, working as detectors, have been suggested, leading to the formulation of the entanglement harvesting protocol. Despite harvesting procedures are currently unfeasible from an experimental point of view, various proposals for implementation exist and a proper modeling of detectors and local interactions is crucial to address entanglement extraction via realistic setups. In the final part of the work, we address entanglement characterization in position space, primarily focusing on black hole spacetimes. We first investigate a possible interpretation of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy in terms of the entanglement entropy arising in discrete quantum field theories, on account of the area law. Then, we discuss the resolution of the black hole information paradox via the gravitational fine-grained entropy formula, which provides a new way to compute the entropy of Hawking radiation and allows to preserve unitarity in black hole evaporation processes.",
New submissions,Compact binary systems in Einstein-Ãther gravity. II. Radiation reaction to 2.5 post-Newtonian order,"Fatemeh Taherasghari,Clifford M. Will",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We obtain the equations of motion for compact binary systems (black holes or neutron stars) in an alternative theory of gravity known as Einstein-AEther theory, which supplements the standard spacetime metric with a timelike four-vector (the AEther field) that is constrained to have unit norm. The equations make use of solutions obtained in Paper I for the gravitational and AEther field potentials within the near zone of the system, evaluated to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order ($O(v/c)^5$ beyond Newtonian gravity), sufficient to obtain the effects of gravitational radiation reaction to the same order as the quadrupole approximation of general relativity. Those potentials were derived by applying the post-Minkowskian method to the field equations of the theory. Using a modified geodesic equation that is a consequence of the effects of the interaction between the AEther field and the internal strong-gravity fields of the compact bodies, we obtain explicit equations of motion in terms of the positions and velocities of the bodies, focussing on the radiation-reaction terms that contribute at 1.5PN and 2.5PN orders. We obtain the rate of energy loss by the system, including the effects of dipole gravitational radiation (conventionally denoted $-1$PN order) and the analogue of quadrupole radiation (denoted $0$PN order). We find significant disagreements with published results, based on calculating the energy flux in the far zone using a ``Noether current'' construction.",
New submissions,Stochastic inflation as a superfluid,Gianmassimo Tasinato,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We point out that inflationary superhorizon fluctuations can be effectively described by a set of equations analogous to those governing a superfluid. This is achieved through a functional SchrÃ¶dinger approach to the evolution of the inflationary wavefunction, combined with a suitable coarse-graining procedure to capture large-scale dynamics. The irrotational fluid velocity is proportional to the gradient of the wavefunction phase. Marginalizing over short superhorizon modes introduces an external force acting on the fluid velocity. The quantum pressure characteristic of the superfluid plays a role in scenarios involving an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation. Our superfluid framework is consistent with the standard Starobinsky approach to stochastic inflation while offering complementary insights, particularly by providing more precise information on the phase of the inflationary wavefunction. We also discuss a heuristic approach to include dissipative effects in this description.",
New submissions,Affine connections for Galilean and Carrollian structures: a unified perspective,"Quentin Vigneron,Hamed Barzegar,James Read",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We develop a classification of general Carrollian structures, permitting affine connections with both torsion and non-metricity. We compare with a recent classification of general Galilean structures in order to present a unified perspective on both. Moreover, we demonstrate how both sets of structures emerge from the most general possible Lorentzian structures in their respective limits, and we highlight the role of global hyperbolicity in constraining both structures. We then leverage this work in order to construct for the first time an ultra-relativistic geometric trinity of gravitational theories, and consider connections which are simultaneously compatible with Galilean and Carrollian structures. We close by outlining a number of open questions and future prospects.",
New submissions,Parity violation in photon quasinormal modes of black holes,"Sugumi Kanno,Jiro Soda,Akira Taniguchi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Given that black holes are ubiquitous in the universe and axion-like scalar fields are potential candidates for dark energy and/or dark matter, it is natural to consider cosmological black holes endowed with axion hair. We investigate the photon quasinormal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole with axion hair where the electromagnetic field is coupled to the axion field via a Chern-Simons interaction. We derive the master equations for the electromagnetic field as a set of coupled equations for parity-even and parity-odd modes and numerically compute quasinormal modes by using Leaver's continued fraction method. We find parity violation in the polarization of photons within the quasinormal mode spectrum. This parity violation in electromagnetic signals could serve as a new probe to explore the nature of the dark sector.",
Cross submissions,Dirac brackets for classical radiative observables,"Francesco Alessio,Riccardo Gonzo,Canxin Shi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We introduce a new coherent state expansion of the exponential representation of the S-matrix for the classical gravitational two-body problem. By combining the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism with the Dirac bracket structure emerging in the classical limit, we derive compact and gauge-invariant expressions for scattering observables in the presence of radiation. This causal formulation bypasses the calculation of KMOC cuts and provides a direct link between observables and a minimal set of classical matrix elements extracted from amplitudes. We illustrate our method with several examples, including the impulse, spin kick, angular momentum, waveform and the related radiative fluxes. Finally, using our formalism we evaluate for the first time the spin kick and the change in angular momentum of each particle up to $\mathcal{O}(G^2 s_1^{j_1} s_2^{j_2})$ with $j_1+ j_2 \leq 11$.",
Cross submissions,Orbital angular momentum can take non-integer values in a closed universe,"Daniel Burgarth,Paolo Facchi",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We show that the spectrum of orbital angular momentum in quantum mechanics consists of two parts when the underlying space has periodic boundaries. While the first part consists of the usual textbook integer quantized values, the second is a continuous band arising from regions at the `edge' of space with respect to the center of rotation. The spectrum thus contains not only half-integer values, previously thought impossible for orbital angular momentum, but even irrational ones. Remarkably, this effect is independent of the size of space. While these spectral components remain undetectable in laboratory experiments, they could still produce observable effects on cosmological scales, for instance in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.",
Cross submissions,Coherence and Entanglement in a Quantum Spacetime,"Iarley P. Lobo,Gislaine VarÃ£o,Giulia Gubitosi,Moises Rojas,Valdir B. Bezerra",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the emergence of quantum coherence and quantum correlations in a two-particle system with deformed symmetries arising from the quantum nature of spacetime. We demonstrate that the deformation of energy-momentum composition induces a momentum-dependent interaction that counteracts the decoherence effects described by the Lindblad equation in quantum spacetime. This interplay leads to the formation of coherence, entanglement and other correlations, which we quantify using concurrence, the $l_1$-norm of coherence, quantum discord and Local Quantum Fisher Information. Our analysis reveals that while the openness of quantum spacetime ultimately degrades entanglement, it also facilitates the creation and preservation of both classical and quantum correlations.",
Cross submissions,Constraining the Baryon Fraction in the Intergalactic Medium with 92 localized Fast Radio Bursts,"Yang Liu,Yuchen Zhang,Hongwei Yu,Puxun Wu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are emerging as powerful cosmological probes for constraining the baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium (IGM), offering a promising avenue to address the missing baryon problem. In this paper, we analyze constraints on the IGM baryon fraction ($f_\mathrm{IGM}$) using 92 localized FRBs, incorporating a corrected probability distribution function for the IGM dispersion measure within three different cosmological models. We find that variations in the underlying cosmological model have a negligible impact on the inferred values of $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. While the NE2001 Galactic electron density model yields slightly higher $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ values compared to the YMW16 model, the results are consistent within the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, there is no statistically significant evidence for redshift evolution in $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. Our analysis constrains $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ to the range $0.8 \sim 0.9$, providing strong support for the idea in which the majority of the missing baryons reside in the diffuse IGM.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with no electromagnetic counterparts,"Jade Powell,Bernhard MÃ¼ller",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are regularly observed electromagnetically, prompting targetted searches for their gravitational-wave emission. However, there are scenarios where these powerful explosions may not have any observable electromagnetic signal, but would still have strong detectable emission in gravitational waves and neutrinos. A regular CCSN explosion may be obscured by matter in the Galaxy. A star may undergo a failed CCSN explosion, where the stalled shockwave is not revived, and would eventually form a black hole. Higher mass progenitor stars may revive the shock, but form a black hole too quickly for the shockwave to reach the surface of the star and produce an electromagnetic signal. Previous work has shown that we can determine if a black hole forms from the CCSN neutrino emission if there are long duration sinusoidal modulations in the neutrino signal caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The SASI also produces an observable signature in the gravitational-wave emission. In this paper, we investigate if we can distinguish between different scenarios for electromagnetically dark CCSNe using the gravitational-wave emission alone. We find, using a reconstruction of the SASI mode, abrupt end times of the gravitational-wave emission, and the rate of change of frequency of the dominant mode, that we are able to accurately distinguish between an obscured CCSN, a failed CCSN, and an explosion with fast black hole formation.",
Cross submissions,Essential Renormalization Group Equation for Gravity coupled to a Scalar field,"Nobuyoshi Ohta,Masatoshi Yamada",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the essential renormalization group equation, in which inessential couplings are removed via field redefinitions, for Einstein gravity coupled to a massive scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant. Our results indicate that perturbatively nonrenormalizable terms can be eliminated due to the cosmological term, in contrast to the case of perturbation around flat spacetime. We find a nontrivial fixed point for the Newton coupling and the cosmological term.",
Cross submissions,Test of conformal gravity as an alternative to dark matter from the observations of elliptical galaxies,"Li-Xue Yue,Da-Ming Chen",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"As an alternative gravitational theory to General Relativity (GR), the Conformal Gravity (CG) has recently been successfully verified by observations of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) and the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. The observations of galaxies only pertain to the non-relativistic form of gravity. In this context, within the framework of the Newtonian theory of gravity (the non-relativistic form of GR), dark matter is postulated to account for the observations. On the other hand, the non-relativistic form of CG predicts an additional potential: besides the Newtonian potential, there is a so-called linear potential term, characterized by the parameter $\gamma^*$, as an alternative to dark matter in Newtonian gravity. To test CG in its non-relativistic form, much work has been done by fitting the predictions to the observations of circular velocity (rotation curves) for spiral galaxies. In this paper, we test CG with the observations from elliptical galaxies. Instead of the circular velocities for spiral galaxies, we use the velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies. By replacing the Newtonian potential with that predicted by non-relativistic form of CG in Hamiltonian, we directly extend the Jeans equation derived in Newtonian theory to that for CG. By comparing the results derived from the ellipticals with that from spirals, we find that the extra potential predicted by CG is not sufficient to account for the observations of ellipticals. Furthermore, we discover a strong correlation between $\gamma^*$ and the stellar mass $M^*$ in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This finding implies that the variation in $\gamma^*$ violates a fundamental prediction of Conformal Gravity (CG), which posits that $\gamma^*$ should be a universal constant.",
