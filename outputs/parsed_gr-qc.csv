New submissions,Possible evidences for physics beyond $Λ$CDM from DESI DR2 data,Rong-Jia Yang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We analyze DESI DR2 data with a model-independent method and find that: (a) the expansion of the universe may speed up with a confidence level more than 2.3 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{51}\in (0.51, 0.955)$; (b) the expansion of the universe may speed down with a confidence level greater than 1.7 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{75}\in (0.955, 1.484)$; (c) $w_{\rm{x}}\leq w_{\rm{t}}<-1$ with confidence level exceeding 1.6 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{53}\in (0.922, 0.955)$.",
New submissions,"Dark Matter Surrounded Quartic Square-root Horndeski Black Hole: Thermodynamics, Optical Properties and Quasinormal Oscillations","Mrinnoy M. Gohain,Kalyan Bhuyan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we study a special form of Horndeski solutions, viz. quartic ""square-root"" Horndeski black hole immersed in a perfect-fluid dark-matter halo, by examining its thermodynamics, null geodesic shape, optical shadow, and quasinormal ringdown spectrum. The model is characterized by three parameters, namely $\beta$, $\eta$ (non-minimal Horndeski coupling parameters), and $b$ (perfect fluid dark matter parameter), which collectively determine horizon properties and observational effects. To study thermodynamic stability, we used the specific heat and free energy arguments, with which we demonstrated that small horizon states are locally stable but are never globally preferred. Analytic solutions of null geodesics reveal the radius of the photon sphere and the critical impact parameter, proving that increases in the dark matter parameters and the Horndeski parameter $\beta$ enlarge both the photon sphere and the subsequent shadow, whereas increase in the Horndeski coupling $\eta$ causes a mild diminishing in the shadow radius. Numerical ray tracing verifies these qualitative trends in the apparent shadow. Using the 6$^{th}$ - order WKB approximation method, we also calculate the scalar quasinormal modes and determine that oscillation frequencies and damping rates behave oppositely according to the sign and magnitude of each parameter. By comparing the shadow radius with the recent Event Horizon Telescope constraints on the Sgr A*, we find a narrow window of parameter space that agrees with observed data. In other words, the coupling parameters should be very small. These measurements restrict modified gravity impacts within realistic astrophysical contexts.",
New submissions,Bound-state resonances of the Schwarzschild black hole: Analytic treatment,Shahar Hod,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inspired by an earlier idea of Mashhoon, who suggested to relate the discrete quasinormal resonant modes of a black hole to the bound-state resonances of the corresponding inverted black-hole potential, Völkel [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 134}, 241401 (2025)] has recently computed numerically, for the first time, the bound-state energy spectrum of the inverted Schwarzschild potential. Motivated by this intriguing work, in the present work we use {\it analytical} techniques in order to explore the physical and mathematical properties of the Schwarzschild bound-state resonances. In particular, we derive closed-form compact analytical formulas for the infinite spectrum $\{E_n\}_{n=0}^{n=\infty}$ of energy eigenvalues that characterize the inverted (binding) black-hole potential. Interestingly, it is explicitly shown that our analytically derived energy spectrum of the black-hole inverted potential agrees remarkably well with the corresponding numerical data that recently appeared in the physics literature.",
New submissions,"Accelerated expansion of the universe model with parametrization of $q(z)$ in $f(R,L_m)$ theory of gravity","Khomesh R. Patle,G. P. Singh,Romanshu Garg",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this research work, we explore the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of modified gravity, specifically $f(R, L_m)$ theory, by considering two non-linear models: $f(R, L_{m}) = \frac{R}{2}+(1+\eta R) L_{m}$ and $f(R, L_{m}) = \frac{R}{2}+ L_{m}^{\eta}$, where $\eta$ is a free parameter. Adopting a parametric form of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we derive a quadratic expression for the normalized Hubble parameter. By use of Bayesian statistical analysis with the $\chi^{2}$-minimization approach, we determine the median values of the model parameters for both the cosmic chronometer (CC) and the joint (CC+Pantheon) dataset. Furthermore, we examine the fundamental cosmological parameters: energy density, pressure, the equation of state (EoS) parameter and energy conditions. The cosmographic parameters are thoroughly analyzed and the present age of the universe is estimated based on this model.",
New submissions,"Charged, rotating black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory","Carlos Herdeiro,Eugen Radu,Etevaldo dos Santos Costa Filho",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The asymptotically flat, electrically charged, rotating black holes (BHs) in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMd) theory are known in closed form for \textit{only} two particular values of the dilaton coupling constant $\gamma$: the Einstein-Maxwell coupling ($\gamma=0$), corresponding to the Kerr-Newman (KN) solution, and the Kaluza-Klein coupling ($\gamma=\sqrt{3}$). Rotating solutions with arbitrary $\gamma$ are known only in the slow-rotation or weakly charged limits. In this work, we numerically construct such EMd BHs with arbitrary $\gamma$. We present an overview of the parameter space of the solutions for illustrative values of $\gamma$ together with a study of their basic properties. The solutions are in general KN-like; there are however, new features. The data suggest that the spinning solutions with $0<\gamma<\sqrt{3}$ possess a zero temperature limit, which, albeit regular in terms of curvature invariants, exhibits a $pp$-singularity. A different limiting behaviour is found for $\gamma>\sqrt{3}$, in which case, moreover, we have found hints of BH non-uniqueness for the same global charges.",
New submissions,Novel Mechanism for Production of Planck Relics in Third Order Effective Field Theory,"Lorens F. Niehof,Sjors Heefer,Andrea Fuster,Federico Toschi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a novel mechanism for the formation of black hole remnants arising from a third order effective field theory correction to general relativity. We first calculate the corresponding modifications to the Schwarzschild metric and the Hawking temperature and use these to derive a modified evaporation law that deviates significantly from the classical prediction for sufficiently small black holes. Notably, the rate of mass loss vanishes at a critical mass $M_{crit}$, while the Hawking temperature remains finite. This leads to a freeze-out in the evaporation process, naturally producing stable black hole remnants of Planck scale called Planck relics. We also identify a local maximum in the evaporation rate for a certain mass $M_{*} > M_{crit}$, and compute the corresponding heat capacities which differ from Hawking's predictions. Our results show that higher-order curvature corrections in effective field theory can provide a physical mechanism for the production of black hole remnants, although the validity of such predictions near the Planck scale remains limited by the breakdown of semiclassical approximations.",
New submissions,Effects of acceleration on interatomic interactions,"Shijing Cheng,Wenting Zhou,Hongwei Yu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"The Unruh effect establishes a fundamental equivalence between acceleration and thermality by demonstrating that a uniformly accelerated ground-state detector undergoes excitation as if immersed in a thermal bath. In this paper, we investigate how acceleration influences the interaction between two ground-state atoms that are synchronously and uniformly accelerated in vacuum with proper acceleration $a$ and coupled to a fluctuating electromagnetic field. We find that the resulting interaction potential comprises both diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j=k$, which are present in both inertial and acceleration cases, and off-diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j\neq k$, which arise exclusively due to acceleration and vanish in the inertial case. The dependence of each component on acceleration and interatomic separation $L$ generally differs. For small accelerations, the leading-order diagonal components of the van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction potentials remain unchanged from their inertial counterparts, exhibiting the standard scaling behaviors $\sim L^{-6}$ and $\sim L^{-7}$, respectively. In contrast, the off-diagonal components scale as $\sim a^2L^{-4}$ in the vdW subregions and $\sim a^2L^{-5}$ in the CP subregion. However, when the acceleration becomes sufficiently large, both diagonal and off-diagonal components of the vdW and CP interaction potentials are significantly modified, giving rise to entirely new interaction behaviors that deviate from those observed in the inertial case, whether in vacuum or thermal environments, indicating a breakdown of the acceleration-thermality equivalence established by the Unruh effect for single detectors.",
New submissions,Quasi-normal modes and shadows of scale-dependent regular black holes,"Benjamin Koch,Gonzalo J. Olmo,Ali Riahinia,Ángel Rincón,Diego Rubiera-Garcia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper we investigate how a regular scale-dependent black hole, characterized by a single extra parameter $\epsilon$, behaves under perturbations by a test field (quasi-normal modes) and under light imaging (shadows) in a four-dimensional space-time background. On the quasi-normal modes side, we study how it responds to scalar and Dirac perturbations. To do this, we implement the well known WKB semi-analytic method of 6th order for obtaining the quasi-normal frequencies. We discuss the behavior of the real and imaginary parts of the quasi-normal modes for different values of the parameter $\epsilon$ and the overtone $n$ and multipole $\ell$ numbers. On the black hole imaging side, we ray-trace the geometry and illuminate it with a thin-accretion disk. Choosing $\epsilon=1.0$ we compute the size of the central brightness depression and generate full images of the black hole. We discuss the features (i.e. luminosity) of successive photon rings through the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound, unstable geodesics. Furthermore we use the correspondence (in the limit $\ell \gg n$) between quasi-normal mode frequencies and unstable bound light orbits to infer the numerical values of the latter using the former and find a remarkable accuracy of the correspondence in providing the right numbers. Our results support the usefulness of this correspondence in order to perform cross-tests of black holes using these two messengers.",
New submissions,Impact of Detector Calibration Accuracy on Black Hole Spectroscopy,"Mallika R. Sinha,Ling Sun,Sizheng Ma",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Systematic errors in detector calibration can bias signal analyses and potentially lead to incorrect interpretations suggesting violations of general relativity. In this study, we investigate how calibration systematics affect black hole (BH) spectroscopy, a technique that uses the quasinormal modes (QNMs) emitted during the ringdown phase of gravitational waves (GWs) to study remnant BHs formed in compact binary coalescences. We simulate a series of physically motivated, tunable calibration errors and use them to intentionally miscalibrate numerical relativity waveforms. We then apply a QNM extraction method -- the rational QNM filter -- to quantify the impact of these calibration errors. We find that current calibration standards (errors within $10\%$ in magnitude and $10^\circ$ in phase across the most sensitive frequency range of 20--2000 Hz) are adequate for BH ringdown analyses with existing observations, but insufficient for the accuracy goals of future upgraded and next-generation observatories. Specifically, we show that for events with a high ringdown signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 120$, calibration errors must remain $\lesssim 6\%$ in magnitude and $\lesssim 4^\circ$ in phase to avoid introducing biases. While this analysis addresses a particular aspect of BH spectroscopy, the results offer broadly applicable quantitative benchmarks for calibration standards crucial to fully realizing the potential of precision GW astrophysics in the next-generation detector era.",
New submissions,Observational viability of fractional holographic dark energy in LRS Bianchi type-I cosmological model,"Shivangi Rathore,Elangbam Chingkheinganba Meetei,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We scrutinized the Locally Rotational Symmetry (LRS) Bianchi type-I cosmological model in the presence of fractional holographic dark energy. We calculate the value of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using the field equations. After that, we fit the model by employing the MCMC techniques to observational data, which includes Hubble, Hubble+BAO, Hubble+Pantheon+Shoes, and Hubble+BAO+Pantheon+Shoes datasets. With the help of these datasets, we calculate the model parameters, viz. $H_{0}(z), \alpha,$ and $\Omega_{m_{0}}$. The value of $H_{0}(z),\alpha$ and $\Omega_{m_{0}}$ lies in the range $67.688^{+1.246}_{-1.197}- 67.80^{+1.23}_{-1.23}, 0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.15}- 0.885^{+0141}_{-0.149}$ and $0.264^{+0.018}_{-0.018}- 0.27^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ respectively. Our results indicate that the evolution of the density parameters corresponding to dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), particularly for $\alpha=1.01$, along with the transition at $z_{t} = 0.55$ of the deceleration parameter $q$ from positive values to $-1$, reflects a phase of accelerated expansion that closely resembles the $\Lambda$CDM model. The behavior of the equation of state (EoS) parameter further demonstrates that the Universe's evolution aligns well with the framework of the fractional holographic dark energy (FHDE) model, suggesting its compatibility with scenarios of late-time cosmology. Moreover, the analysis of the statefinder diagnostics ${(r,s)}$ and the present value of ${(r,s)} = (0.74,0.07)$ reveal characteristics that converge towards the $\Lambda$CDM fixed point. A comparison between the observational constraints on our model parameters and those of the $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits a strong degree of agreement, thereby reinforcing the physical plausibility and consistency of the proposed cosmological model.",
New submissions,Formation of multiple Black Holes from Cauchy data,"Dawei Shen,Jingbo Wan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"We construct a family of asymptotically flat Cauchy initial data for the Einstein vacuum equations that contain no trapped surfaces, yet whose future development admits multiple causally independent trapped surfaces. Assuming the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, this implies the formation of multiple black holes in finite time. The initial data are obtained by surgically modifying a vacuum geometrostatic manifold equipped with the Brill-Lindquist metric: the data agree exactly with the Brill-Lindquist metric outside a collection of balls centered at its multiple poles, and each ball is replaced by a constant-time slice of a well-prepared dynamical spacetime. The construction is based on Christodoulou's short-pulse framework, a stability analysis in the finite future of the short-pulse region, the geometry of geometrostatic manifolds with small mass and large separation, and the obstruction-free annular gluing method developed by Mao-Oh-Tao. The absence of trapped surfaces in the initial data is verified via a standard mean curvature comparison argument.",
New submissions,Kaluza-Klein inspired a model of the inflation with the inversed power law potential in Bianchi type-I universe,"Jaturaporn Wattanakumpolkij,Patinya Ma-ardlerd,Natthason Autthisin,Pornpatara Chuvala,Nutthaphat Lunrasri,Chakrit Pongkitivanichkul,Daris Samart",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work considers the dynamics of the gauge vector and inflaton (dilaton) fields inspired by Kaluza-Klein theory in an inflationary universe with Bianchi type-I spacetime. The inverse power-law potential of the inflaton field is used to study dynamical system analysis. As a result, all fixed points in the autonomous system are non-hyperbolic fixed points, and one cannot determine their stability. Therefore, a center manifold theory is required to analyze the stability of the dynamical system properly. Interestingly, we found an isotropic attractor point which means that the universe undergoes accelerated expansion (inflation) from an anisotropic phase to an isotropic phase of the universe. According to the dynamical system analysis of the anisotropic Bianchi type-I universe with the inspired Kaluza-Klein model, our results supported the isotropization of the observed universe.",
New submissions,Quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of axial gravitational perturbations of regular black holes in asymptotically safe gravity,"Qi-Long Shi,Rui Wang,Wei Xiong,Peng-Cheng Li",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we present a detailed study of axial gravitational perturbations of the regular black hole solution in asymptotically safe gravity, as proposed in \cite{Bonanno:2023rzk}. We analyze the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of this black hole using two numerical techniques: the Bernstein spectral method and the asymptotic iteration method (AIM). These approaches allow us to compute QNM frequencies with high accuracy, even for higher overtones. Our results show that the fundamental mode is only weakly affected by the deviation parameter, whereas notable deviations from the Schwarzschild case emerge for higher overtones. Additionally, we examine the correspondence between grey-body factors and QNMs using the sixth-order WKB approximation, finding excellent agreement, especially for larger multipole numbers l.",
New submissions,Observational Constraints on Scalar Field--Matter Interaction in Weyl Integrable Spacetime,Andronikos Paliathanasis,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We test an analytic cosmological solution within the framework of Weyl Integrable Spacetime using current observational data. In this model, dark energy is described by a pressureless fluid, while a scalar field arises naturally through the definition of the connection. This gravitational theory reveals a Chameleon Mechanism leading to a nonzero interaction between the scalar field and the matter sector. This model extends the standard $\Lambda $CDM cosmology by introducing one additional degree of freedom, allowing for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM dynamics. For the observational constraints we consider the Supernova data of Pantheon+ collaboration, the Cosmic Chronometers, the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillators of DESI DR2 collaboration and the gamma-ray bursts. We find that Weyl Integrable Spacetime fits the data in a better way than the $\Lambda$CDM. When all datasets are considered, the statistical comparison indicates a weak to moderate preference for Weyl Integrable Spacetime according to the Akaike Information Criterion and Jeffrey's scale for the Bayesian evidence.",
New submissions,Canonical Analysis of Eddington Gravity,J. Kluson,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),In this short note we perform canonical analysis of Eddington gravity using L. Faddeev and Jackiw formalism. We demonstrate that resulting canonical action has the same form as General Relativity canonical action which proves an equivalence of Eddington gravity and General Relativity in Hamiltonian formalism.,
New submissions,Constraining parameters of spinor field dark energy: An alternative to $Λ$CDM model under the spherically symmetric FLRW space-time,"Bijan Saha,Mahendra Goray",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study constrains the cosmological parameters within the scope of a spherically symmetric FLRW cosmological model, the role of a nonlinear spinor field in the universe's evolution. To test this approach, we incorporate the recent Cosmic chronometers, Supernova, and Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. It is found that if spherical coordinates give the FLRW model, the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of the spinor field possesses nontrivial non-diagonal components. These non-diagonal components of EMT neither depend on the spinor field nonlinearity nor the value of the parameter $k$ defining the type of curvature of the FLRW model. In this context, we construct a dark energy model and perform an MCMC simulation to obtain the best-fit values of the parameters. The results are well comparable to the present Hubble parameter and deceleration parameter, indicating the accelerated expansion of the universe.",
New submissions,Testing Quantum-Corrected Black Holes with QPOs Observations: A Study of Particle Dynamics and Accretion Flow,"G. Mustafa,Sushant G. Ghosh,Orhan Donmez,S.K. Maurya,Shakhzod Orzuev,Farruh Atamurotov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the epicyclic oscillations of test particles around rotating quantum-corrected black holes (QCBHs), characterized by mass $M$, spin $a$, and quantum deformation parameter $b$. By deriving the radial ($\Omega_r$) and vertical ($\Omega_\theta$) oscillation frequencies, we explore their dependence on spacetime parameters and show that quantum corrections ($b \neq 0$) significantly modify the dynamics compared to the classical Kerr case. Through numerical modelling of accretion around QCBHs, we further examine how $b$ influences strong-field phenomena, comparing the results with test-particle dynamics and observational data. Our analysis reveals: 1. Quantum corrections shift the ISCOs outward, with $b$ altering the effective potential and conditions for stable circular motion. 2. The curvature of the potential and thus the epicyclic frequencies change $\Omega_r$ shows up to 25% deviation for typical $b$ values, underscoring sensitivity to quantum effects. 3. Precession behavior is modified: while Lense-Thirring precession ($\Omega_{LT}$) remains primarily governed by $a$, periastron precession ($\Omega_P$) is notably affected by $b$, especially near the black hole. 4. Accretion disk simulations confirm the physical effects of $b$, aligning well with the test particle analysis. Moreover, quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequencies obtained via both approaches agree with observed low-frequency QPOs from sources like GRS $1915+105$, GRO $J1655{-}40$, XTE $J1550{-}564$, and $H1743{-}322$. The distinct frequency profiles and altered ratios offer observational signatures that may distinguish QCBHs from classical black holes. Our findings present testable predictions for X-ray timing and a new avenue to constrain quantum gravity parameters.",
New submissions,One Membrane to Love them all: Tidal deformations of compact objects from the membrane paradigm,"Michela Silvestrini,Elisa Maggio,Sumanta Chakraborty,Paolo Pani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The tidal deformability is a key observable to test the nature of compact objects in a binary coalescence. Within vacuum General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of a four-dimensional black hole are strictly zero, while they are non-zero and model-dependent for material objects, matter distributions around black holes, or in alternative theories of gravity. Here, we develop a model-agnostic framework based on the membrane paradigm, where the tidal properties of a spherically symmetric object are encoded in the response of a fictitious membrane in terms of viscosity coefficients. We show that both neutron stars and exotic compact objects (in particular, we provide an explicit example for thin-shell gravastars) are included in this framework, provided that the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients of the membrane have a nontrivial frequency dependence. We derive a general result for the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers for non-rotating and spherically symmetric compact objects in terms of the viscosity coefficients, discussing their behavior with the compactness of the object, and identifying the conditions for the logarithmic behavior found in previous literature for various ultracompact objects. Finally, we show that the membrane shear viscosity coefficients associated with neutron star models feature novel quasi-universal relations, which depend only mildly on the neutron-star equation of state.",
New submissions,Weak Field Limit of the Nonminimally Coupled Weyl Connection Gravity,Cláudio Gomes,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The true nature of gravity is a remarkable open problem in Gravitation. Theoretical and observational motivations open the avenue of alternative theories of gravity. One possibility resorts to nonminimal couplings and non-metricity properties of spacetime, and is dubbed as nonminimally coupled Weyl connection gravity. It has the advantage of leading to metric field equations of second order together with a constraint equation for the Weyl vector, and has well behaved space-form. We analyse this model by exploring its weak regime and its implications for astrophysics and cosmology.",
New submissions,Characteristic equations of linearized $λR$ gravity,"J. Aldair Pantoja-Gonzalez,D. Vanessa Castro-Luna,Alberto Escalante(Puebla U., Inst. Fis.)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"A detailed Hamilton-Jacobi analysis for linearized $\lambda R$ gravity is developed. The model is constructed by rewriting linearized gravity in terms of a parameter $\lambda$ and new variables. The set of all hamiltonians is identified successfully, and the fundamental differential is established. The non-involutive hamiltonians are eliminated, and the Hamilton-Jacobi generalized brackets are calculated. Such brackets are used to report the characteristic equations, and the counting of the number of degrees of freedom is performed. We fixed the gauge to indicate an intimate closeness between the model under study and linearized gravity.",
New submissions,Weak null singularity for the Einstein-Euler system,Yuefeng Song,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"We study the behavior of a self-gravitating perfect relativistic fluid satisfying the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of a weak null terminal spacetime singularity. This type of singularities is expected in the interior of generic dynamical black holes. In the vacuum case, weak null singularities have been constructed locally by Luk, where the metrics extend continuously to the singularities while the Christoffel symbols fail to be square integrable in any neighborhood of any point on the singular boundaries. We prove that this type of singularities persists in the presence of a self-gravitating fluid. Moreover, using the fact that the speed of sound is strictly less than the speed of light, we prove that the fluid variables also extend continuously to the singularity.",
New submissions,Jeans analysis in modified gravity: A general formulation,"Ryan Khaled,Kamel Ourabah",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the Jeans instability of a self-gravitating fluid in the context of alternative gravitational theories. Our formulation accommodates arbitrary corrections to the Newtonian potential, providing a versatile approach to analyzing a wide range of gravity theories in the weak-field limit. As concrete examples, we explore in detail three specific modifications: the Maneff potential, a logarithmic correction, and a Yukawa-type correction to Newtonian gravity. These three cases serve as representative examples of the range of functional forms -- power-law, logarithmic, and exponential -- that one might expect to arise in alternative theories of gravity. We determine the conditions for instability and the growth rate of perturbations for these potentials. To evaluate their validity, we compare the established stability criteria with the observed stability data from Bok globules, thereby enabling us to place constraints on the parameters of these alternative gravitational theories. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the quantum regime, offering a broader perspective on the interplay between gravity and quantum effects in the context of alternative theories of gravity.",
New submissions,Theories of the gravity+gauge type in de Sitter space,"Julian Lang,Yasha Neiman",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study theories of the ""General Relativity + Yang-Mills"" type in 4d spacetime with cosmological constant, focusing on formulations where the basic variables are connections and curvatures (but no metric). We present a new Lagrangian for GR coupled to Yang-Mills, which uses the same kind of variables for both sectors, and has a manifest double-copy structure. This Lagrangian comes in both non-chiral (real) and chiral (complex) versions. The chiral version makes it easy to isolate the self-dual sector. The latter lends itself to a higher-spin (HS) generalization, which combines the HS Self-Dual GR and HS Self-Dual Yang-Mills of Krasnov, Skvortsov and Tran. We then descend from the covariant formulation to lightcone gauge, and construct a cubic-exact lightcone action. For HS Self-Dual Yang-Mills, we solve the lightcone field equations to all orders in perturbation theory. Finally, we discuss the relation between lightcone foliations that share a lightray -- a setup relevant for the scattering problem in the de Sitter static patch. We derive this relation at the linearized level, and argue from causality+symmetry that it cannot receive non-linear corrections. We explore the associated gauge transformations in the non-linear covariant theory.",
New submissions,Orthogonal splitting of the Riemann curvature tensor and its implications in modeling compact stellar structures,"A. Rehman,Tayyab Naseer,Nazek Alessa,Abdel-Haleem Abdel-Aty",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Although the interpretation of complexity in extended theories of gravity is available in the literature, its illustration in $f(R,L_{m},\mathcal{T})$ theory is still ambiguous. The orthogonal decomposition of the Riemann tensor results in the emergence of complexity factor as recently proposed by Herrera [1]. We initiate the analysis by contemplating the interior spacetime as a static spherical anisotropic composition under the presence of charge. The modified field equations are derived along with the establishment of association between the curvature and conformal tensors that have significant relevance in evaluating complexity of the system. Furthermore, the generalized expressions for two different masses are calculated, and their link with conformal tensor is also analyzed. Moreover, we develop a particular relation between predetermined quantities and evaluate the complexity in terms of a certain scalar $Y_{TF}$. Several interior solutions admitting vanishing complexity are also determined. Interestingly, compact objects having anisotropic matter configuration along with the energy density inhomogeneity possess maximum complexity. It is concluded that the spherical distribution of matter might not manifest complexity or admitting minimal value of this factor in the framework of $f(R,L_{m},\mathcal{T})$ theory due to the appearance of dark source terms.",
New submissions,Analysis of the action-based constrained adiabatic particle production model,"Souvik Pramanik,Meir Lewkowicz,M. Schiffer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The theory of gravitationally induced adiabatic particle production offers an alternative approach to exploring the accelerating expansion of the universe. However, existing models generally lack a well-defined field-action formulation. This article aims to establish a suitable Lagrangian formulation consistent with the framework of particle creation. A general form of action is considered for this purpose. The corresponding field equations in comparison with those commonly used in the particle creation formalism leads to some specific form of the Lagrangian, which further restricts the form of the particle creation models. We perform a phase space stability analysis of the constrained model in hand and show that our model is capable of explaining the cosmic evolution from the radiation dominated era to the late-time cosmic acceleration if the model parameter has the bound $1/3 < \beta < 2/3$.",
New submissions,Dynamical Horizons and Black Hole Soft Hair,Albert Huber,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In the present work, quasilocal Brown-York charges are derived that coincide in the large sphere limit with the conserved supertranslation hair and superrotation charges introduced by Hawking, Perry and Strominger in [45, 46]. Given these charges, a general scenario is outlined in which a non-rotating black hole completely evaporates after its collapse due to particle creation effects, whereby a genuine one-way traversable event horizon is never formed, but merely a two-way traversable dynamical (resp. future trapping) horizon. The formation of such a dynamical horizon has the consequence, as is demonstrated, that quasilocal energy transported by the considered charges, and thus information, can continuously escape through the black hole horizon to infinity; a mechanism which, as is argued, could possibly prevent information loss once the black hole formation and evaporation process comes to an end.",
New submissions,Cosmology of Cubic Poincaré Gauge gravity,"Sebastian Bahamonde,Rebecca Briffa,Konstantinos Dialektopoulos,Damianos Iosifidis,Jackson Levi Said",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this paper, we study flat FLRW cosmology for a Poincaré gauge theory containing cubic invariants that is free from ghosts in arbitrary backgrounds in the axial and vector sectors of the torsion tensor. The new degrees of freedom can be related to hypermomentum but continue to be dynamical even in vacuum. These extra degrees of freedom open a more natural way in which to construct potential gravitational models that provide possible ways to modify astrophysical and cosmological physics. In this framework, we study two particular branches of the theory where preliminary routes of exploring these new variables are exposed. The first is the branch where the hypermomentum vanishes, while the second branch involves the setting where the perfect fluid and hypermomentum parts of the sources are independently conserved. In both settings, we find generically faster expanding cosmologies with similar estimates of the cosmic matter content as in the standard model of cosmology. Cubic Poincaré Gauge gravity offers an interesting theoretical basis on which to study cosmology, and indicates some preliminary positive constraints when compared with observational constraints.",
New submissions,Optical Appearance and Shadow of Kalb-Ramond Black Hole: Effects of Plasma and Accretion Models,"Mou Xu,Ruonan Li,Jianbo Lu,Shining Yang,Shu-Min Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we study the effect of the presence of plasma and different accretion models on the shadow and optical appearance of static spherically symmetric black holes containing the Kalb-Ramond field. We derive the motion equations for photons around the Kalb-Ramond black hole and constrain the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameters $\lambda$ and $\gamma$ using observational data released by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration. The results indicate that, under the static spherical accretion model, as $\lambda$ or $\gamma$ increase, the peak value of the observed intensity for Kalb-Ramond black holes is enhanced and consistently exceeds that of the corresponding Schwarzschild black holes. In the presence of plasma, we find that as the plasma frequency increases, the photon sphere radius increases, whereas the black hole shadow radius decreases. In addition, compared to inhomogeneous plasma, the effect of homogeneous plasma on these features is more significant. Specifically, when the plasma is homogeneous, an increase in plasma frequency further enhances the observed intensity peaks. This suggests that the shadow of the Kalb-Ramond black hole is brighter due to the presence of plasma. Additionally, for the same Kalb-Ramond black hole model parameters and plasma frequency, the shadow of the Kalb-Ramond black hole in inhomogeneous plasma is larger than in the case of homogeneous plasma. Under the thin disk accretion model, an increase in the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameters decreases the observed intensity peak and increases the thickness of the photon ring and the lensed ring. The presence of plasma significantly alters the optical appearance of Kalb-Ramond black hole, providing a possible way to distinguish Kalb-Ramond black hole from Schwarzschild black hole.",
New submissions,Can an Extra Degree of Freedom in Scalar-Tensor Non-Metricity Gravity Account for the Evolution of the Universe?,"Ghulam Murtaza,Avik De,Andronikos Paliathanasis,Tee-How Loo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate whether the extra scalar degree of freedom that arises in the second connection class of scalar-tensor non-metricity gravity can accurately replicate and potentially enrich the cosmic expansion history. Focusing on a spatially flat FLRW background, we introduce Hubble-normalized variables and recast the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system. Four representative scenarios are analyzed comprehensively. Phase-space research reveals a rich hierarchy of critical points: matter-dominated, stiff-fluid, and de Sitter solutions, together with asymptotic trajectories leading to Big-Crunch/Rip singularities and transient, unstable matter epochs. With suitable parameter choices, the standard $\Lambda$CDM sequence is reinstated; however, novel late-time and high-curvature regimes arise exclusively from the non-metricity sector. A systematic comparison of metric scalar-tensor and teleparallel scalar-torsion theories reveals unique stability characteristics and potential observational discriminants. Our findings indicate that the additional time-dependent function inherent to scalar-tensor non-metricity gravity can effectively explain the Universe's evolution while providing new phenomenology that can be tested by upcoming surveys.",
New submissions,Fully Self-Consistent Semiclassical Gravity,"R. Muciño,E. Okon,D. Sudarsky,M. Wiedemann",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"A theory of quantum gravity consists of a gravitational framework which, unlike general relativity, takes into account the quantum character of matter. In spite of impressive advances, no fully satisfactory, self-consistent and empirically viable theory with those characteristics has ever been constructed. A successful semiclassical gravity model, in which the classical Einstein tensor couples to the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of quantum matter fields, would, at the very least, constitute a useful stepping stone towards quantum gravity. However, not only no empirically viable semiclassical theory has ever been proposed, but the self-consistency of semiclassical gravity itself has been called into question repeatedly over the years. Here, we put forward a fully self-consistent, empirically viable semiclassical gravity framework, in which the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a quantum field, evolving via a relativistic objective collapse dynamics, couples to a fully classical Einstein tensor. We present the general framework, a concrete example, and briefly explore possible empirical consequences of our model.",
New submissions,Gravitational lensing observables in stationary and axisymmetric solutions in general relativity,"Matteo Luca Ruggiero,Davide Astesiano",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate light propagation in self-gravitating systems composed of an axially symmetric, stationary, rotating dust fluid. These configurations are intrinsically relativistic, sustained entirely by their rotation, since no compact or finite dust distribution can exist under the same symmetry conditions in Newtonian gravity. In such systems, rotational effects arise from off-diagonal components of the spacetime metric, which are not negligible compared to their Newtonian counterparts. We analyze how these components affect the deflection angle of light, showing that they can be interpreted as contributing an additional effective mass. Moreover, their presence can, in principle, be detected through the characteristic asymmetry they induce in the images of background sources.",
New submissions,Hierarchical constraints on gravitational waves from horizonless compact objects,"Rajrupa Mondal,Julian Westerweck,Yotam Sherf,Collin D. Capano",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We use the data of several promising gravitational wave observations to obtain increasingly stringent bounds on near-horizon deviations of their sources from the Kerr geometry. A range of horizonless compact objects proposed as alternatives to black holes of general relativity would possess a modified gravitational wave emission after the merger. Modelling these objects by introducing reflection of gravitational waves near the horizon, we can measure deviations from Kerr in terms of a single additional parameter, the location of the reflection. We quote bounds on deviations for 5 events in addition to previous results obtained for GW150914. Additionally, we improve upon previous results by hierarchically combining information from all analysed events, yielding a bound on deviations of less than $1.3 \times 10^{-26}$ meters above the horizon.",
Cross submissions,Correction to: The Double-Wedge Algebra for Quantum Fields on Schwarzschild and Minkowski Spacetimes,Bernard S. Kay(York),Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"There is an error in the proof (but not the truth) of Theorem 3.2 in the author's 1985 paper ""The Double-Wedge Algebra for Quantum Fields on Schwarzschild and Minkowski Spacetimes"" in ""Communications in Mathematical Physics"". The author became aware of that error and of how it may be corrected soon after it went to print, and two companion papers published soon afterwards (in Helvetica Physica Acta) refer to an ""erratum to appear"". This is that erratum. We also take the opportunity to note a few (unrelated and minor) corrections to those two companion papers and also to very briefly mention related more recent work.",
Cross submissions,How to Count States in Gravity,"Vijay Balasubramanian,Tom Yildirim",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Gibbons and Hawking proposed that the Euclidean gravity path integral with periodic boundary conditions in time computes the thermal partition sum of gravity. As a corollary, they argued that a derivative of the associated free energy with respect to the Euclidean time period computes gravitational entropy. Why is this interpretation is correct? That is, why does this path integral compute a trace over the Hilbert space? Here, we show that the quantity computed by the Gibbons-Hawking path integral is equal to an {\it a priori} different object -- an explicit thermal trace over the Hilbert space spanned by states produced by the Euclidean gravity path integral. This follows in two ways: (a) if the Hilbert space with two boundaries factorizes into a product of two single boundary Hilbert spaces, as we have previously shown; and (b) via explicit resolution of the trace by a spanning basis of states. We similarly show how a replicated Euclidean gravity path integral with a single periodic boundary computes a Hilbert space trace of powers of the density matrix, explaining why this approach computes the entropy of states entangled between two universes.",
Cross submissions,Observing Leptogenesis in Action with Gravitational Waves,"Hitoshi Murayama,Bea Noether,Jan Schütte-Engel",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Leptogenesis is arguably the best motivated theory of baryogenesis given the discovery of finite neutrino masses, yet its experimental test is elusive given its high energy scale. We discuss gravitational waves (GWs) produced via graviton bremsstrahlung in right-handed neutrino decays during leptogenesis. The presence of right-handed neutrinos in the early universe can lead to a period of early matter domination. In this context, the resultant GW spectrum scales quadratically with the right-handed neutrino mass, while its peak frequency scales inversely with the Yukawa coupling. Detecting such a spectrum would provide strong evidence for leptogenesis and the existence of heavy right-handed neutrinos. We also discuss how the GW spectrum emitted from the thermal plasma is altered by an era of early matter domination. We show that it can mimic the effects of additional relativistic degrees of freedom and a higher reheating temperature, and that information from the graviton bremsstrahlung GW spectrum can break this degeneracy.",
Cross submissions,The Komar charge in presence of the Holst term and the gravitational Witten effect,"José Luis V. Cerdeira,Tomás Ortín",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the first-order formalism, the Einstein--Hilbert action can be modified by the addition of a Holst term multiplied by the Barbero parameter $\alpha$. This modification breaks parity although it does not affect the equations of motion. We show that the standard Komar charge is also modified by the addition of a topological term multiplied by the Barbero parameter $\alpha$. For the Killing vector that generates time translations, the value of the Komar integral at infinity is modified by the addition of a term proportional to the NUT charge $N$ and the parity-breaking Barbero parameter. Thus, as in the standard Witten effect, a non-vanishing NUT charge $N$ induces a non-vanishing mass $\alpha N$.",
Cross submissions,A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud,"Zi-Yu Tang,Eleftherios Papantonopoulos",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (like Wald extended solution) valid in realistic astrophysical environment, we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. Notably, the first-order study indicates that this photon cloud exists with no threshold for the coupling constant. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. Intriguingly, the induced EM field exhibits significantly different symmetries in contrast to the background EM field, which may serve as an indication of the existence of both an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling. Furthermore, in the near horizon region, the induced EM field has some overlap with the photon region as expected.",
Cross submissions,Observer Time from Causality in Perturbative Quantum Gravity,Allic Sivaramakrishnan,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"It is unclear whether an observable notion of time exists in quantum gravity even in principle because spacetime itself fluctuates. We propose a form of observable time in perturbative quantum gravity. First, we define an elapsed proper time in curved space using intersections of worldlines and future light cones. Here, time arises from causality via the dependence on light cones. We then propose that performing the gravitational path integral describes quantum gravity corrections to this notion of proper time at all orders in $G_N$. Using this prescription, we compute the leading quantum gravity corrections to two-point correlation functions of elapsed time. We find that the commutators can be nonzero, showing this notion of time is a quantum operator in quantum gravity.",
Cross submissions,The Carrollian Kaleidoscope,"Arjun Bagchi,Aritra Banerjee,Prateksh Dhivakar,Saikat Mondal,Ashish Shukla",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincaré group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT).We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS.Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.",
Cross submissions,Frequency Differences between Clocks on the Earth and the Moon,"Mingyue Zhang,Jürgen Müller,Sergei M. Kopeikin",Geophysics (physics.geo-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Space Physics (physics.space-ph),"Based on general relativity, clock comparisons enable the determination of the gravity potential relative to a stable reference. Lunar surface clocks, owing to the Moon's low-noise conditions, high orbital stability, and broad Earth visibility, are promising reference clocks for global-scale comparisons between terrestrial clocks. Meanwhile, the need for an independent lunar time system-driven by future lunar navigation-requires maintaining links to terrestrial standards. This Letter simulates fractional frequency differences between Earth (E) and Moon (L) clocks by modeling three key time transformations: proper-to-coordinate time for E-clocks and for L-clocks (both linked to the local gravity potential), and the coordinate time relation between Earth and Moon. Signal propagation effects are not addressed. Gravity potential differences impact observations at the 10^-10 level, and the coordinate time ratio at 10^-11. Contributions from static, tidal, and non-tidal potentials, body self-rotation, and different celestial bodies are evaluated.",
Cross submissions,Black holes as telescopes: Discovering supermassive binaries through quasi-periodic lensed starlight,"Hanxi Wang,Miguel Zumalacárregui,Bence Kocsis",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary systems are unavoidable outcomes of galaxy mergers. Their dynamics encode information about their formation and growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed. Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final parsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral -- leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections. SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with comparable masses and $z<0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density. Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate outstanding questions around them.",
Cross submissions,Bounds on PBH fraction in a stimulated axion/ALP decay scenario,"Yadir Garnica,J. Barranco,Luis A. Ureña-López",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we show that stimulated decay of axions or axion-like particles (ALP) in black hole superradiance is an efficient way to find and hunt primordial black holes (PBH). When de Broglie's wavelength of the axion/ ALP is comparable or larger than the black hole horizon radius, a large population of them accumulates in the surroundings of the black hole. When these axions or ALPs couple to photons, the bosonic cloud decays into radiation that contributes to the X-ray, visible light, and radio wave background flux that can exceed current observational limits measured at Earth. If the masses are in the interval of $10^{-3}\mathrm{eV}<\mu <1\mathrm{eV}$, to be consistent with current observations of microwave background light, we found that the fraction of primordial black holes should be smaller than $f_{PBH} < 10^{-17}$ for primordial black holes with masses within $10^{-19} M_{\odot}<M_{BH}<10^{-7} M_\odot$.",

Zakharov,History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"General Relativity (GR) was created in November 1915 and since its creation and up to now this theory has undergone many tests. The first realistic cosmological models were proposed in the works of Friedman, written in the 1920s. For a long time Friedman's cosmological works were actually banned in Soviet Union due to philosophical reasons, since the models where the birth and evolution of the Universe occurs were considered ideologically unacceptable. Due to great achievements in relativity and cosmology and due to increasing interest to these branches of of science in last decades we recall a development of relativistic astrophysics and contribution of Russian researchers in these studies. Since one of the world leaders in physical cosmology A. A. Friedman passed away in September 1925, it is reasonable to outline the main achievements of physical cosmology over the past 100 years. We discuss also observational and theoretical achievements in confirmations of relativistic observational predictions for black holes, including the closest supermassive black hole in our Galactic Center. We outline an evolution of black hole shadow from the purely theoretical concept to observable quantities for supermassive black holes in Sgr A* and M87*.",
Cross submissions,GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and astrophysical implications,"Isobel Romero-Shaw,Jakob Stegmann,Hiromichi Tagawa,Davide Gerosa,Johan Samsing,Nihar Gupte,Stephen R. Green",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.",
