New submissions,Master field equations for spherically symmetric gravitational fields beyond general relativity,Raúl Carballo-Rubio,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"I construct a set of master field equations encompassing all possible second-order field equations for spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity. The structure of 2-dimensional Horndeski theory is leveraged to define a spherically symmetric gravitational tensor that is identically conserved and can play an equivalent role as the Einstein tensor in the coupling to spherically symmetric stress-energy tensors. The master field equations provide a framework in which to study a wide variety of previously intractable problems and prove general results across different theories, as illustrated with the example of the Jebsen--Birkhoff theorem that holds generally. This work sets up the stage for the study of the dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity and provides powerful tools for the exploration of a new paradigm of black hole physics.",
New submissions,dot-PE: Sampler-free gravitational wave inference using matrix multiplication,"Jonathan Mushkin,Javier Roulet,Barak Zackay,Tejaswi Venumadhav,Oryna Ivashtenko,Digvijay Wadekar,Ajit Kumar Mehta,Matias Zaldarriaga",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.",
New submissions,Ultrarelativistic limit of the Kerr theorem,"Eloy Ayón-Beato,Daniel Flores-Alfonso,Mokhtar Hassaine",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The original Kerr theorem provides the foundation for Kerr-Schild transformations by classifying all shear-free and geodesic null congruences in flat spacetime; the key ingredient of the Kerr-Schild ansatz. However, due to the high level of degeneracy of the outcome it is often less practical than its symmetric refinements, which may single out congruences leading to physically significant spacetimes by imposing relevant symmetries. An illustrative example is the stationary axisymmetric version of Kerr theorem which has been shown to lead directly and uniquely to the Kerr black hole in vacuum. In this work, we propose a new symmetric refinement of the Kerr theorem by boosting the stationary symmetry into its ultrarelativistic limit to achieve invariance under null translations, while keeping axisymmetry. Under these assumptions, the classification yields only two distinct congruences. The first congruence is covariantly constant and, through the Kerr-Schild ansatz, evidently yields an axisymmetric pp-wave. The vacuum axisymmetric profile of this pp-wave displays a logarithmic dependence on the polar radius, characteristic of the exterior gravitational field of the Bonnor light beam, and includes as a special case the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit of the Schwarzschild black hole. The Kerr-Schild transformation of the second congruence gives rise to a non-trivial vacuum solution recently reported in [Phys. Rev. D 112, 024020 (2025)]. Using circularity and appropriately fixing the reparameterization invariance of the orthogonal manifold to the Killing fields, we show that the latter solution corresponds to the well-known Taub-NUT spacetime with planar topology. These results emphasize how symmetry-based refinements of the Kerr theorem constitute a powerful tool to constructing physically essential spacetimes.",
New submissions,Influence of dark matter on quantum entanglement and coherence in curved spacetime,"Shu-Min Wu,Yu-Xuan Wang,Si-Han Shang,Wentao Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Dark matter (DM) remains undetected, and developing theoretical models such as the promising perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) is a key challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we investigate the quantum characteristics of PFDM by analyzing the behavior of quantum entanglement and coherence for both fermionic and bosonic fields near a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a PFDM halo. Our results reveal that PFDM can either enhance or degrade quantum entanglement and coherence, depending sensitively on its density. Notably, bosonic entanglement shows greater susceptibility to PFDM effects compared to fermionic entanglement, while fermionic coherence exhibits a stronger dependence on PFDM than its bosonic counterpart. These findings highlight the necessity of selecting appropriate quantum probes for DM detection based on the type of quantum resources, as different quantum fields exhibit significantly different responses to PFDM in curved spacetime.",
New submissions,Emergent field theory,Erick I. Duque,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The uniqueness theorems for general relativity and Yang-Mills theories can be circumvented by dropping the ubiquitous, yet often implicit, assumption that physical fields, such as the spacetime metric, are fundamental. The novel concept of emergent fields makes it possible to construct modified theories of gravity and forces where the spacetime metric and strength tensor fields emerge from a covariance analysis in the canonical formulation with nontrivial relations to the fundamental phase space and no additional degrees of freedom are required. This is an example of a post-Einstein-Yang-Mills theory that implies new physics. In particular, explicit realizations of the theory in symmetry-reduced systems have shown robust resolutions of the singularities that plague the classical theories in regions of extreme spacetime curvature, including nonsingular (SU(2)xU(1)-charged) black holes with a cosmologial constant and collapsing solutions, as well as Gowdy and FLRW cosmologies. Further applications include modifications in the spectrum of quasinormal modes and in the evaporation process of black holes, as well as relativistic formulations of long-range gravitational effects capable of modeling MOND as an alternative solution to the dark matter problem. New results here include an extension of the spherically symmetric system that couples SU(2) gauge fields and the generalization of previous dynamical, homogeneous solutions.",
New submissions,QFT vector models: Definitions and basic properties,Matti Raasakka,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"QFT vector models are a newly developed approach to quantum gravity. In this proceedings paper, we review in short form some basic definitions and properties related to these models, and point out directions for future research.",
New submissions,Relativistic Fluid Dynamics in Curved Spacetime: a Novel Effective Hamiltonian Approach,"Arpan Krishna Mitra,Subir Ghosh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a comprehensive Eulerian (Hamiltonian) framework for relativistic fluid dynamics in curved spacetimes, with emphasis on Schwarzschild geometry. The key innovation lies in the consistent use of density and three-velocity fields, all defined in coordinate (Newtonian) time, while fully incorporating relativistic and curvature effects. {\it We stress that the entire dynamics is developed in coordinate (Eulerian) time, from the viewpoint of a static Eulerian observer.} In the non-relativistic regime, it is well known that Poisson brackets between the density $\rho(\vec{x}, t)$ and velocity fields $v^i(\vec{x}, t)$, together with an appropriate Hamiltonian, yield the continuity and Euler equations as Hamiltonian equations of motion. These field-theoretic Poisson brackets can be derived from canonical phase-space brackets defined on Lagrangian variables $(x_i, p_j)$, mapped to Eulerian fields $(\rho, v^i)$. We extend this framework to curved spacetime by constructing a relativistic version of the Eulerian Poisson algebra and proposing a corresponding Hamiltonian. This yields relativistic continuity and Euler equations valid in generic spacetimes, with evolution in coordinate time. Applying this to the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain exact stationary background solutions for radial flows and perform a perturbative stability analysis. We also introduce a generalised vorticity and examine its effect on perturbations over irrotational backgrounds, revealing its role in flow stability. This work offers a unified, first-principles Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic fluid dynamics in curved geometries, forming a foundation for further study of astrophysical and cosmological fluid phenomena.",
New submissions,"Dehnen-type dark matter wormholes in the $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{L}_m,\mathcal{T})$ action","A. Errehymy,O. Donmez,B. Turimov,K. Myrzakulov,N. Alessa,A.-H. Abdel-Aty",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We are exploring the possibility of traversable wormholes existing in a more realistic context. Specifically, we are looking at scenarios that don't rely on exotic factors, like having a mass shell at the throat or allowing particles and antiparticles to coexist without annihilation. To do this, we are constructing wormholes with double power-law density distributions, drawing inspiration from the Dehnen-type dark matter halo in the framework of generalized geometry-matter coupling gravity. Our investigation carefully considers the challenges of traversability and stability, as well as the roles of exotic matter, the exoticity parameter, and the anisotropy parameter. We have discovered solutions that describe asymmetric, asymptotically flat traversable wormholes, supported by a smooth metric and double power-law density distributions. These solutions successfully avoid the problems, giving us hope that such wormholes could actually exist in nature.",
New submissions,From a collapsing radiating star to an evaporating black hole: A smooth transition from classical to quantum entropy,"Sarbari Guha,Shamima Khan,Rituparno Goswami",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a robust mechanism where the geometrical free-gravitational entropy of an isolated astrophysical radiating star undergoing continual gravitational collapse, as measured by an external observer, makes a smooth transition to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the onset of the horizon formation and in the late times of black hole evaporation. It is interesting to note that both in the classical regime and the semi classical evaporating black hole regime, the matter is radiated via the Vaidya exterior surrounding the radiating star, as well as the evaporating black hole. Our result, being independent of the interior matter dynamics of the collapsing star, clearly indicates that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and its non-extensive nature indeed originates from the Riemannian geometry, which dictates the free-gravity entropy in general relativity.",
New submissions,Transients in black hole perturbation theory,"Jérémy Besson,Javier Carballo,Christiana Pantelidou,Benjamin Withers",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Black hole quasinormal modes arise as eigenmodes of a non-normal Hamiltonian and consequently they do not obey orthogonality relations with respect to commonly used inner products, for example, the energy inner product. A direct consequence of this is the appearance of transient phenomena. This review summarises current developments on the topic, both in frequency- and time-domain. In particular, we discuss the appearance of i) transient plateaus: arbitrarily long-lived sums of quasinormal modes, corresponding to localised energy packets near the future horizon; ii) transient growth, with the latter either appearing in the vicinity of black hole phase transitions or in the context of higher-derivative Sobolev norms.",
New submissions,Lensing Fingerprints of Scalar Hair and Broken Symmetries via Three Semi-Analytical Methods,"Ali Övgün,Reggie C. Pantig",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a detailed derivation of the weak-field deflection of light in the scalar hairy black hole spacetime with scalar charge $Q_s$ and bumblebee gravity black hole spacetime, characterized by a Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$. Starting from the metric, we derive the photon orbit equation up to second order in the small parameters $M/b$, $Q_s$ or $\ell$. Then we derive the weak-field deflection angle via three independent semi-analytical techniques- (1) Homotopy-Perturbation Method, (2) Variational Iteration Method, (3) Single-Impulse (Transverse-Kick) Method-are each applied in full detail. We demonstrate exact agreement among these approaches and discuss their relative computational efficiencies, thereby offering diverse tools for lensing calculations in spherically symmetric spacetimes.",
New submissions,Dynamical analog spacetimes from nonlinear perturbations in a topological material,"Surajit Das,Surojit Dalui,Hrishit Banerjee,Arpan Krishna Mitra",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Emergent spacetime analogs in condensed matter systems have opened a fascinating window into simulating aspects of gravitational physics in controlled laboratory environments. In this work, we develop a comprehensive nonlinear analog gravity framework within a topological material, incorporating the impact of Berry curvature on the hydrodynamic flow of electrons. Unlike prevalent studies in existing literature limited to linear perturbations, we derive and analyze a fully nonlinear wave equation governing radial perturbations of density and velocity fields, which dynamically generate an effective acoustic metric. Taking the example of graphene as a representative system, and calculating its properties from first principles, we numerically demonstrate the formation of evolving acoustic horizons and quantify analog Hawking temperatures in experimentally accessible regimes. Our findings suggest that topological materials can serve as versatile platforms to probe rich gravitational phenomena, including horizon dynamics and quasi-thermal emission, beyond conventional linear approximations. This work lays the groundwork for exploring nonlinear emergent spacetime in a broad class of quantum materials, bridging condensed matter physics and gravitational analogs.",
New submissions,Shadows from thin accretion disks of parametrized black hole solutions,"Gonzalo J. Olmo,João Luís Rosa,Diego Rubiera-Garcia,Alejandro Rueda,Diego Sáez-Chillón Gómez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We discuss the optical appearance from thin accretion disks in parametrized black holes, namely, solutions characterized by an arbitrarily large number of parameters without any regards to the theory of the gravitational and matter fields they come from. More precisely, we consider the leading-order terms of the spherically symmetric Johanssen-Psaltis (JP) and Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) parametrizations after imposing constraints from asymptotic flatness and solar system observations. Furthermore, we use the inferred correlation, by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, between the size of the bright ring (which is directly observable) and the size of the central brightness depression (which is not) of M87 and Sgr A$^*$ central supermassive objects, to constrain the parameters of the leading-order JP and KZ solutions. Using ten samples of the Standard Unbound distribution previously employed in the literature to reproduce certain scenarios of General Relativistic HydroDynamical simulations, we produce images of four samples of JP and KZ geometries enhancing and diminishing the shadow's size, respectively. Via a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the features of the corresponding photon rings and, in particular, of their relative brightness, we argue that it should be possible to distinguish between such parametrized solutions and the Schwarzschild geometry via future upgrades of very long baseline interferometry. We furthermore consider images of some naked objects within these parametrizations, and also discuss the role of inclination in comparing images of different black holes.",
New submissions,Gravitational Wave Scattering on Magnetic Fields,"Valerie Domcke,Camilo Garcia-Cely,Sung Mook Lee",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The conversion of gravitational to electromagnetic waves in the presence of background magnetic fields is known as the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, analogous to the Primakoff effect for axions. Rephrasing this conversion as a classical electrodynamics problem in the far-field regime of a magnetized region, we derive the angular distribution of the intensity and polarization of the emitted electromagnetic waves. We discuss the interplay of the internal structure of the magnetic field, the polarization of the gravitational wave and the scattering angle, demonstrating for example that a dipolar field can convert an unpolarized stochastic gravitational wave background into polarized electromagnetic emission, with peak emission intensity along the equator. We moreover outline how to incorporate medium effects in this framework, necessary for a realistic 3D description of gravitational wave to photon conversion in the magnetosphere of neutron stars.",
New submissions,Cosmology with a Non-minimally Coupled Dark Matter Fluid I. Background Evolution,"Samuele Silveravalle,Andrea Lapi,Francesco Benetti,Stefano Liberati",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore a cosmological model in which dark matter is non-minimally coupled to gravity at the fluid level. While typically subdominant compared to Standard Model forces, such couplings may dominate dark matter dynamics. We show that this interaction modifies the early-time Friedmann equations, driving a phase of accelerated expansion that can resolve the horizon and flatness problems without introducing additional fields. At even earlier times, the coupling to spatial curvature may give rise to a cosmological bounce, replacing the initial singularity of standard cosmology. These results suggest that non-minimally coupled dark matter could offer a unified framework for addressing both the singularity and fine-tuning problems.",
New submissions,Multi-field TDiff theories: the mixed regime case,"Antonio L. Maroto,Prado Martín-Moruno,Diego Tessainer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study theories breaking diffeomorphism (Diff) invariance down to the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff), consisting of multiple scalar fields in a cosmological background. In particular, we focus on models involving a field dominated by its kinetic term and a field dominated by its potential, coupled to gravity through power-law functions of the metric determinant. The Diff symmetry breaking results in the individual energy-momentum tensors not being conserved, although the total conservation-law is satisfied. Consequently, an energy exchange takes place between the fields, acting as an effective interaction between them. With this in mind, we consider the covariantized approach to describe the theory in a Diff invariant way but with an additional field, and discuss the phenomenological consequences of these models when it comes to the study of the dark sector.",
New submissions,Spinfoam tunneling of quantum geometries in angle variables,"Pietro Donà,Hal M. Haggard,Carlo Rovelli,Gowrisankar Sreeram,Jacopo Taddei",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Tunneling processes offer a promising path for finding signatures of quantum gravity. While tunneling of geometry has long been recognized in the literature, few detailed analyses have been carried out. We investigate covariant Loop Quantum Gravity transitions in the holonomy representation, which naturally encodes the extrinsic curvature of boundary states. We study these amplitudes within the simple framework of the Ponzano-Regge spinfoam model for three-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity. Having identified the geometries that dominate the spinfoam path integral in the classically forbidden regime when it is formulated in terms of dihedral angles as boundary data, we argue that they correspond to tunneling processes. Finally, we characterize these non-classical geometries and show that their contributions to the spinfoam amplitude are exponentially suppressed in the semiclassical limit via analytic continuation of the discrete gravity action. This work sheds light on quantum black-to-white-hole transitions, in particular clarifying the origin of the exponential suppression of various quantum amplitudes.",
New submissions,On the consistency of non-commutative geometry inspired Reissner-Nordström black hole solution,"Gokhan Alkac,Murat Mesta,Gonul Unal",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We revisit the non-commutative geometry inspired Reissner-Nordström black hole solution obtained by smearing the point sources with a Gaussian distribution. We show that while the form of the metric function and the physical properties derived from that remain valid, not all the components of Einstein equations are satisfied. We construct an improved energy-momentum tensor that consistently satisfies Einstein equations and show that it leads to a different prediction for the region where the strong energy condition is violated. For certain choice of parameters, our proposal predicts the violation of the energy condition outside the Cauchy horizon, which might be important for observational signatures.",
Cross submissions,Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries,"Alexander S. Sakharov,Rostislav Konoplich,Merab Gogberashvili",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.",
Cross submissions,A One-sided Witness for the Quantumness of Gravitational Dynamics,"Konstantin Beyer,M. S. Kim,Igor Pikovski",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Quantum information concepts and quantum technologies have opened the prospect to probe quantum gravity in table-top experiments. Many proposals rely on witnessing entanglement generation as a means to probe whether gravity is a quantum channel. Here we formulate a different and conclusive indirect test of the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction. Our witness is based on the concept of verifiable quantum memory in the dynamics of a quantum system. This allows us to assess the quantumness of an interaction between two systems by local measurements on one subsystem only. Our approach enables the first one-sided verification of the quantum nature of gravity, and provides a quantum signature of the interaction that is not fully covered by existing proposals. Our results open novel ways to witnessing the quantum nature of gravity in table-top experiments and clarify how {decisive tests can be designed even with measurements on only the probe system",
Cross submissions,Cosmological correlators in gravitationally-constrained de Sitter states,"Tuneer Chakraborty,Ashik H,Suvrat Raju",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study cosmological correlators in de Sitter quantum gravity in the limit where $G_N \to 0$. This limit is distinct from a nongravitational QFT because the gravitational constraints still force states and observables to be de Sitter invariant. We first examine a class of perturbative correlators that, in gauge-fixed form, are represented by the expectation value of a product of elementary fields on the late-time boundary. We formulate Feynman rules for our computations and enumerate some necessary, but not sufficient, conditions that must be imposed on states and operators to avoid group-volume divergences. These correlators are conformally invariant in all allowed perturbative states but never coincide with QFT vacuum-expectation values. For instance, our sample computations yield interesting non-Gaussianities even when the underlying vacuum wavefunction is Gaussian. However, we show that, in the presence of a heavy background state, it is possible to construct a separate class of state-dependent relational observables whose values approximate QFT correlators in the vacuum. This illustrates a key contrast in quantum gravity -- between observables that are microscopically simple and observables whose expectation values in an appropriate background state lead to simple QFT-like correlators.",
Cross submissions,Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity with a heavy ALP: Higgs Inflation and $α$-attractors,"Georgios K. Karananas,Mikhail Shaposhnikov,Sebastian Zell",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),We initiate the analysis of the inflationary dynamics in Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity nonminimally coupled to the Standard Model of particle physics. We take the axion-like particle of gravitational origin to be heavy and show that inflation with the Higgs field can be accommodated in this framework.,
Cross submissions,Quantum Entanglement Index in String Theory,"Atish Dabholkar,Eleanor Harris,Upamanyu Moitra",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We define a notion of `quantum entanglement index' with the aim to compute it for black hole horizons in string theory at one-loop order using the stringy replica method. We consider the horizon of BTZ black holes to construct the relevant conical orbifolds, labeled by an odd integer $N$, and compute the partition function as a function of $N$, corresponding to the fractional indexed Rényi entropy. We show that it is free of tachyons and naturally finite both in the ultraviolet and the infrared, even though it is generically ultraviolet divergent in the field theory limit. Thus, the index provides a useful diagnostic of the entanglement structure of string theory without the need for analytic continuation in $N$.",
Cross submissions,Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123,"Jakob Stegmann,Aleksandra Olejak,Selma E. de Mink",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with exceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been suggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a first generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense environment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers. We discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a star cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the predicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or higher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\chi_f \gtrsim 0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic distribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to receive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate this scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants within GW231123's primary spin estimate $\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are retained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly spinning second-generation BHs (including $\chi_f>0.9$) can only form if the first-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of massive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous evolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components, implying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would therefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like events, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with large aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed by the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications for the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\rm M_\odot$.",
Cross submissions,Parallel Ray Tracing of Black Hole Images Using the Schwarzschild Metric,"Liam Naddell,Marcelo Ponce","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC); Graphics (cs.GR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)","Rendering images of black holes by utilizing ray tracing techniques is a common methodology employed in many aspects of scientific and astrophysical visualizations. Similarly, general ray tracing techniques are widely used in areas related to computer graphics. In this work we describe the implementation of a parallel open-source program that can ray trace images in the presence of a black hole geometry. We do this by combining a couple of different techniques usually present in parallel scientific computing, such as, mathematical approximations, utilization of scientific libraries, shared-memory and distributed-memory parallelism.",
Cross submissions,Asymmetry in momentum space: restoring CPT invariance of $κ$-field theory,"Tadeusz Adach,Andrea Bevilacqua,Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman,Giacomo Rosati",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The positive and negative energy modes of a field theory in $\kappa$-Minkowski/$\kappa$-Poincaré noncommutative spacetime have very different symmetry properties. This can be understood geometrically by considering that they span two distinct sectors of a curved momentum space. It seems that because of this asymmetry, charge conjugation and Poincaré invariance are incompatible. However, the structure of momentum space suggests that time reversal could be deformed so that the overall CPT-invariance is restored. We test these features by calculating explicitly the whole set of Noether charges associated with continuous relativistic symmetries within the canonical formalism, and study their transformation properties under deformed discrete symmetries.",
Cross submissions,Nonperturbative effects in $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories: A toy model for Planckian physics,"Shinji Hirano,Vinayak Raj",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a nonperturbative completion of two-point correlators in $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs), and analyze their behavior at distance scales shorter than the fundamental length scale set by the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Building on the interpretation of the $T\bar{T}$ deformation as a coupling to two-dimensional quantum gravity with a unique built-in length scale, we advance the study of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs as a toy model for Planckian physics. As we probe shorter distances, trans-Planckian oscillations are followed by a super-Planckian regime in which correlations are typically suppressed by geometric randomness, in contrast to the power-law growth characteristic of CFTs. Moreover, their dependence on distance becomes exponentially weaker, suggesting that the underlying geometric structure has been largely erased -- a behavior broadly consistent with expectations for quantum spacetime in this regime.",
Cross submissions,Dark Matter Admixed Strange Stars: An Effective Single-Fluid Approach,"Samstuti Chanda,Ranjan Sharma",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the structural and physical properties of strange stars admixed with dark matter by modeling the total energy density as a weighted combination of quark matter and bosonic dark matter components regulated by a volume fraction. Both the components are assumed to be distributed throughout the star. The quark matter is described by a linear equation of state (EOS), whereas the bosonic dark matter follows an EOS with repulsive self-interactions. By combining these into a single effective EOS, we reduce the two-fluid system to an equivalent one-fluid model and numerically solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to obtain the mass-radius (M-R) relationship of the hybrid configuration. We systematically analyze how the stellar structure is modified by varying dark matter fractions, the mass of the dark matter particle and the self-repulsion coupling strength. Our results reveal distinct modifications to the M-R profiles and apparent phase behavior of the quark matter suggesting observable signatures that could offer insights into the properties of dark matter in extreme astrophysical environments. This model also provides a possible explanation for ultra-compact stars with small radii, such as XTE J1814-338, suggesting its potential nature as a hybrid star.",
Cross submissions,Rigidity and positivity of Hawking quasi-local energy on area-constrained critical surfaces,Alejandro Peñuela Diaz,Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A key test for any quasi-local energy in general relativity is that it be nonnegative and satisfy a rigidity property; if it vanishes, the region enclosed is flat. We show that the Hawking energy, when evaluated on its natural area-constrained critical surfaces, henceforth called ""Hawking surfaces"", satisfies both properties under the dominant energy condition. In the time-symmetric case, where Hawking surfaces coincide with area-constrained Willmore surfaces, we extend positivity and rigidity to include electric charge, a nonzero cosmological constant, and higher dimensions. In the fully dynamical (non-time-symmetric) case, we establish the first nonnegativity and rigidity theorems for the Hawking energy in this general setting. These results confirm the Hawking energy consistency with basic physical principles and address several longstanding ambiguities and criticisms.",
Cross submissions,"Cosmological Preference for a Positive Neutrino Mass at 2.7$σ$: A Joint Analysis of DESI DR2, DESY5, and DESY1 Data","Guo-Hong Du,Tian-Nuo Li,Peng-Ju Wu,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.",
Cross submissions,"Weinberg's theorem, phantom crossing and screening",Philippe Brax,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider models where the dilaton, seen as the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, plays the role of dark energy. We revisit Weinberg's theorem and show that quantum corrections induced by the graviton lead to the screening of the dilaton locally. We also discuss the time evolution of the equation of state and find that phantom crossing is a natural feature of these models. The time variation of the equation of state and its deviation from $-1$ is limited by screening locally and can only be relaxed when the dilaton is allowed to have a mass of the order of the Hubble rate cosmologically, thus going beyond single-field screened dark-energy models. This obstruction extends to all single-field screened models of the chameleon-type where the large mass of the scalar on cosmological scales leads to a negligible variation of the equation of state at low redshift.",
Cross submissions,Notes from the bulk,Erica Bertolini,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The scope of this Ph.D thesis is to study the effects of the presence of a boundary from a Quantum Field Theoretical perspective, searching for new physics and explanations of observed phenomena. In particular, thanks to the formal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge modes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the bulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs with boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be associated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in order to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the prediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall systems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a physical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum Field Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have non-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining symmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the boundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which also appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a possible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton quasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the algebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never proved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter, elasticity and (massive) gravity models. A collateral result, which enrich this Thesis, is the building of a new covariant QFT for fractons with a peculiar gauge structure. This new model better highlight the properties of these quasiparticles.",
Cross submissions,Global finite energy solutions of the Maxwell-scalar field system on the Einstein cylinder,"Jean-Philippe Nicolas,Grigalius Taujanskas",Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We prove the existence and uniqueness of global finite energy solutions of the Maxwell-scalar field system in Lorenz gauge on the Einstein cylinder. Our method is a combination of a conformal patching argument, the finite energy existence theorem in Lorenz gauge on Minkowski space of Selberg and Tesfahun, a careful localization of finite energy data, and null form estimates of Foschi-Klainerman type. Although we prove that the energy-carrying components of the solution maintain regularity, due to the incompleteness of the null structure in Lorenz gauge and the nature of our foliation-change arguments we find small losses of regularity in both the scalar field and the potential.",
Cross submissions,Quantum thermodynamics in a rotating BTZ black hole spacetime,"Wenjing Chen,Yixuan Ma,Si-Wei Han,Zihao Wang,Jun Feng",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We address the problem of the thermalization process for an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector outside a BTZ black hole, from a perspective of quantum thermodynamics. In the context of an open quantum system, we derive the complete dynamics of the detector, which encodes a complicated response to scalar background fields. Using various information theory tools, such as quantum relative entropy, quantum heat, coherence, quantum Fisher information, and quantum speed of evolution, we examined three quantum thermodynamic laws for the UDW detector, where the influences from BTZ angular momentum and Hawking radiation are investigated. In particular, based on information geometry theory, we find an intrinsic asymmetry in the detector's thermolization process as it undergoes Hawking radiation from the BTZ black hole. In particular, we find that the detector consistently heats faster than it cools, analogous to the quantum Mpemba effect for nonequilibrium systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spin of a black hole significantly influences the magnitude of the asymmetry, while preserving the dominance of heating over cooling.",
Cross submissions,Entanglement Entropy of Quantum Corners,"Luca Ciambelli,Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman,Ludovic Varrin",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In gravitational theories with boundaries, diffeomorphisms can become physical and acquire a non-vanishing Noether charge. Using the covariant phase space formalism, on shell of the gravitational constraints, the latter localizes on codimension-$2$ surfaces, the corners. The corner proposal asserts that these charges, and their algebras, must be important ingredients of any quantum gravity theory. In this manuscript, we continue the study of quantum corner symmetries and algebras by computing the entanglement entropy and quantum informational properties of quantum states abiding to the quantum representations of corners in the framework of $2$-dimensional gravity. We do so for two classes of states: the vacuum and coherent states, properly defined. We then apply our results to JT gravity, seen as the dimensional reduction of $4$d near extremal black holes. There, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a semiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the semiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum informational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general states and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement entropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.",
