New submissions,New charged dynamical particles in spatially flat FLRW space-times,Ion I. Cotaescu,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"New time-dependent metric tensors with spherical symmetry satisfying the Einstein-Maxwell equations in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour are derived here for the first time. These geometries describe dynamical charged non-rotating black holes hosted by the perfect fluid of the asymptotic FLRW space-times. Their gravitational sources are the stress-energy tensors formed by a contribution of the perfect fluid and an electromagnetic one due to the Coulomb field produced by the time-dependent black-hole charge in the asymptotic FLRW background. The dynamics of these models is determined by the dynamical mass, which may be an arbitrary function of time, and two arbitrary real-valued parameters. The first one simulates the effect of a cosmological constant as in our $\kappa$-models we proposed recently [I. I. Cotaescu, Eur. Phys. J. C (2024) 84:819]. The second parameter relates surprisingly the dynamical black hole charge to the cubic root of the mass function. The role of these parameters is investigated analyzing simple examples of dynamical charged black holes in the matter-dominated universe.",
New submissions,Rotation of intrinsic orbital angular momentum and the orbital Hall effect for twisted particles in arbitrary gravitational fields,Alexander J. Silenko,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"For twisted particles in arbitrary gravitational fields, the problems of the rotation of intrinsic orbital angular momentum and the orbital Hall effect are solved in the general case. We need not use the Maxwell equations in curved spacetimes for a description of twisted photons. The exact general equation rigorously defining the OAM dynamics in any Riemannian spacetimes is derived. The general description of different manifestations of the orbital Hall effect for any twisted particles is also presented. Our short analysis shows that the results obtained can find important practical applications.",
New submissions,A relativistic treatment of accretion disk torques on extreme mass ratio inspirals around spinning black holes,"Abhishek Hegade K.R.,Charles F. Gammie,Nicol√°s Yunes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We model the motion of a small compact object on a nearly circular orbit around a spinning supermassive black hole, which is also interacting with a thin equatorial accretion-disk surrounding the latter, through tools from self-force and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We provide an analytical and relativistically-accurate formalism to calculate the rate of energy and angular momentum exchanged at Lindblad resonances. We show that strong relativistic effects can potentially cause a reversal in the direction of the torque on the small compact object if the surface density gradient is not too large. We analytically explore the dependence of the torque reversal location on the spin of the supermassive black hole and demonstrate that the ratio of the reversal location to the innermost stable circular orbit is approximately insensitive to the spin of the supermassive black hole. Our results show that relativistic torques can be 1--2 order of magnitude larger than the Newtonian torque routinely used in the literature to model disk/small-compact-object interactions close to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of including relativistic effects when modeling environmental effects in extreme mass-ratio inspirals.",
New submissions,Wormholes in Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory with identical spacetime asymptotics,"Vladimir Dzhunushaliev,Vladimir Folomeev,Nurzada Beissen,Adilet Nurmukhamedov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Within general relativity, we study spherically symmetric configurations with wormhole topology consisting of spinor fields and a Maxwell electric field. For such a system, we construct complete families of regular asymmetric solutions describing wormholes connecting two identical Minkowski spacetimes. The physical properties of such systems are completely determined by the values of three input quantities: the throat parameter, the spinor frequency, and the coupling constant. Depending on the specific values of these parameters, the configurations may have essentially different characteristics, including negative ADM masses.",
New submissions,Gravitomagnetic-Hydrodynamics and Turbulence in Early Universe,"Jiaxiang Liang,Peng Xu,Minghui Du,Yifu Cheng,Zhan Wang,Ziren Luo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This work tries to establish the theoretical framework for gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamics (GMHD), revealing a fundamental correspondence between geometrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in general relativity. By introducing the gravitoelectromagnetic formalism to relativistic fluids, a set of leading-order GMHD equations is derived that govern the co-evolution of spacetime geometry and matter dynamics in the early Universe. This analysis reveals that, under high-temperature and high-density conditions such as those during the electroweak phase transition, the gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, leading to a strongly coupled fluid-spacetime system. This coupling supports the emergence of gravitational Alfven waves and a turbulent energy cascade. Our findings suggest that GMHD turbulence may leave imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.",
New submissions,Loop quantum inflation with inverse volume corrections in light of ACT data,"Farough Parvizi,Soma Heydari,Milad Solbi,Kayoomars Karami",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Within the framework of loop quantum cosmology (LQC), we investigate the effect of inverse volume corrections on the low scale spontaneously broken supersymmetric (SB SUSY) and exponential inflationary potentials. The LQC modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the observational viability of these models against recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Our results indicate that in contrary to the standard model of inflation, in the presence of inverse volume corrections in LQC, the prediction of SB SUSY and exponential potentials in the $r-n_{\rm s}$ plane lie inside the 68\% confidence level interval of the ACT data.",
New submissions,Effects of the ekpyrotic mechanism on inflationary phase in loop quantum cosmologies,"Christian Brown,Jared Fier,Brian Phillips,Gerald Cleaver,Anzhong Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In bouncing cosmological models, either classical or quantum, the big bang singularity is replaced by a regular bounce. A challenging question in such models is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it is well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce, where $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to introduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes negative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar field will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter fields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe can be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects the inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation is generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases in which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary potential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the influence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in the models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during which the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem is resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the inflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an inflationary phase. This phase can last long enough to solve the cosmological problems existing in the big bang model.",
New submissions,Accretion Disk Luminosity and Topological Characteristics for a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by King Dark Matter Halo,"Soroush Zare,Farokhnaz Hosseinifar,Luis Miguel Nieto,Dhruba Jyoti Gogoi,Kuantay Boshkayev,Ainur Urazalina,Hassan Hassanabadi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study delves into the intricate properties of a Schwarzschild black hole enveloped by King dark matter in an isotropic configuration. The thermodynamic characteristics of this black hole are meticulously analyzed, and the dynamics of massive and massless particles in its vicinity are investigated. In examining the trajectories of massless particles, the shadow cast in the presence of King dark matter is explored, revealing virtual ranges for the corresponding parameters. For the dynamics of massive particles, the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, angular momentum, energy, and angular velocity of a test particle within the King dark matter framework surrounding the black hole are calculated. The effect of King dark matter on the accretion disk energy flux, effective radiation temperature, differential luminosity, and spectral luminosity are then investigated. The stability of the photon sphere in the presence of King dark matter is also studied, and finally, the thermodynamic potentials of this black hole are examined from a topological perspective.",
New submissions,Regular black holes and boson stars in semiclassical gravity,"Irfan Javed,Viqar Husain",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We use a Hamiltonian version of the semiclassical Einstein equation to study classical gravity coupled to a quantum scalar field with potential in spherical symmetry. The system is defined by effective constraints where the matter terms are replaced by their expectation values in a quantum state. For the static case, we find numerically that the resulting equations admit asymptotically flat, de Sitter, and anti-de Sitter boson star and regular black hole solutions. We also show that the Bardeen and Hayward nonsingular black hole proposals (and some generalizations thereof) are not solutions to our equations.",
New submissions,Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes,"Zhilong Liu,Wentao Liu,Xiaofang Liu,Jieci Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.",
New submissions,A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound speed,"Shi-Cheng Liu,Lei-Hua Liu,Bichu Li,Hai-Qing Zhang,Peng-Zhang He",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.",
New submissions,Do Black Holes Exist?,"Leonardo Modesto,Edoardo Rattu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We carefully investigate, extend, and shed new light on the McVittie exact solution of Einstein's gravity (EG) with the focus on the implications in the Universe we live in. It turns out that the only known exact solution of EG, which interpolates between an asymptotic homogeneous and isotropic Universe and a Schwarzschild black hole, is actually singular in 2M, namely, the curvature invariants diverge and the spacetime is geodetically incomplete in 2M. Very important: all energy conditions are satisfied except the dominant one (DEC), which is violated inside the radius 8M/3. Notice that 2M is not the event horizon, but a curvature singularity covered by an apparent horizon that, at the actual stage of the Universe, nearly coincides with 2M. Moreover, the curvature singularity is not analytic with respect to the dynamics of the Universe encoded in the Hubble function $H(t)$: for arbitrarily small but not zero $H^\prime(t)$, the curvature invariants are singular, while for $H^\prime(t)$ identically zero, they are regular. Therefore, we can not analytically decouple the black hole from the entire Cosmos, namely, we can not assume the Schwarzschild solution locally and the FRW metric at large scale without violating the analyticity of the metric. Since the spacetime does not exist for $r \leqslant$2M, and since the DEC is violated for r<8M/3, we are allowed to doubt the existence of black holes in our Universe as understood up to now. In particular, the violation of DEC seems catastrophic for the spacetime stability below 8M/3. We build and study a toy model for the gravitational collapse, generalizing the Vaidya to the McVittie-Vaidya metric. Although dynamical, the singularities remain in the same locations. Finally, in order to achieve the curvature smoothness and geodesic completion, we propose two solutions: one in Einstein's conformal gravity, and the other replacing M with M(r).",
New submissions,Impact of Thermodynamic Corrections on the Stability of Hayward-Anti de Sitter Black Hole Surrounded by a Fluid of Strings,"Shyamalee Bora,Dhruba Jyoti Gogoi,Pralay Kumar Karmakar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore the modified thermodynamics of a Hayward-Anti de Sitter (H-AdS) black hole in atypical conditions, incorporating a string fluid, Hayward regularisation, and quantum entropy corrections. Our analysis reveals a first-order phase transition between small and large black hole phases, characterised by a swallowtail behaviour in the Gibbs free energy profiles. It is found that the key parameters - string fluid strength, Hayward regularisation scale, and quantum correction coefficients significantly influence the critical temperature and phase stability of the H-AdS system. It is further noticed that a large black hole phase is stabilised by these modifications, with quantum corrections smoothing the transition. This model offers a valuable framework to study quantum gravity effects on black hole thermodynamics with potential implications in analysing black hole evolution and astrophysical observations.",
New submissions,Analysis of minimum orbital periods around d-dimensional charged black holes,"Yan Peng,Guohua Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"This paper investigates the bounds on the minimum orbital period for test objects around d-dimensional charged black holes in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We find numerically that the minimum orbital period decreases as the charge of the black hole increases. Thus, the upper limit is reached for an uncharged black hole, while the lower limit is attained for a maximally charged one. We then analytically derive the upper and lower bounds for the minimum orbital period. These results improve our understanding of dynamics around d-dimensional black holes and impose constraints on candidate gravity theories.",
New submissions,$I-$Love$-$Curvature: Exploring compact stars' quasi-universal relation with curvature scalars,"M. D. Danarianto,A. Sulaksono",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate quasi-universal relations in neutron stars linking standard observables, such as tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) and normalized moment of inertia ($\bar{I}$), with normalized curvature scalars in general relativity. These curvature scalars include the Ricci scalar ($\mathcal{R}$), the Ricci tensor contraction ($\mathcal{J}$), the Weyl scalar ($\mathcal{W}$), and the Kretschmann scalar ($\mathcal{K}$). We systematically examine both piecewise polytropic and color-flavor-locked equations of state, finding: (1) significant correlations between both local (central and surface) and global (volume-averaged) curvature scalars with $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$; (2) especially strong correlations between surface and volume-averaged curvature scalars and both $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$; (3) a near equation-of-state-independent maximum for the normalized Ricci scalar, suggesting a link to the trace anomaly; and (4) new universal relations involving normalized central and volume-averaged pressure and energy density, which also correlate strongly with $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$. Using constraints from GW170817 and low-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that $\Lambda$ measurements directly constrain both scalar curvature quantities and the interior properties of canonical-mass neutron stars. These findings agree with the literature on equation-of-state-dependent Bayesian inference estimates. Our identified relations thus provide an equation-of-state-insensitive connection between stellar observables, spacetime geometry, and the microphysics of compact stars.",
New submissions,The Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields on radiative asymptotically flat spacetimes,"Mikhail Molodyk,Andr√°s Vasy",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"On a large class of asymptotically flat spacetimes which includes radiative perturbations of Minkowski space, we define a distinguished global Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields by means of the microlocal approach to non-elliptic Fredholm theory, working in the de,sc-pseudodifferential algebra due to Sussman. We extend the limiting absorption principle (the ""$i\varepsilon$ prescription"" for the Feynman propagator) to this setting. Motivated by the complicated Hamilton flow structure arising in this problem, we also prove a new localized radial point estimate in the spirit of Haber-Vasy which, under appropriate nondegeneracy assumptions, allows one to propagate microlocal regularity into a single radial point belonging to a larger radial set which can be a source, sink, or saddle for the Hamilton flow.",
New submissions,"Biased parameter inference of eccentric, spin-precessing binary black holes","Divyajyoti,Isobel M. Romero-Shaw,Vaishak Prasad,Kaushik Paul,Chandra Kant Mishra,Prayush Kumar,Akash Maurya,Michael Boyle,Lawrence E. Kidder,Harald P. Pfeiffer,Mark A. Scheel",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"While the majority of gravitational wave (GW) events observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors are consistent with mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) on quasi-circular orbits, some events are also consistent with non-zero orbital eccentricity, indicating that the binaries could have formed via dynamical interactions. Moreover, there may be GW events which show support for spin-precession, eccentricity, or both. In this work, we study the interplay of spins and eccentricity on the parameter estimation of GW signals from BBH mergers. We inject eccentric signals with no spins, aligned spins, and precessing spins using hybrids, TEOBResumS-DALI, and new Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, respectively, and study the biases in the posteriors of source parameters when these signals are recovered with a quasi-circular precessing-spin waveform model, as opposed to an aligned-spin eccentric waveform model. We find significant biases in the source parameters, such as chirp mass and spin-precession ($\chi_p$), when signals from highly-eccentric BBHs are recovered with a quasi-circular waveform model. Moreover, we find that for signals with both eccentricity and spin-precession effects, Bayes factor calculations confirm that an eccentric, aligned-spin model is preferred over a quasi-circular precessing-spin model. Our study highlights the complex nature of GW signals from eccentric, precessing-spin binaries and the need for readily usable inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric, spin-precessing waveform models for unbiased parameter estimation.",
New submissions,Dyonic RN-like and Taub-NUT-like black holes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity,"Shoulong Li,Liang Liang,Liang Ma",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Einstein-bumblebee gravity is one of the simplest vector-tensor theories that realizes spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. In this work, we first construct an exact dyonic Reissner-Nordstr√∂m-like black hole solution in four dimensions, carrying both electric and magnetic charges and admitting general topological horizons. We then study its thermodynamic properties, and employ the Wald formalism to compute the conserved mass and entropy, thereby establishing the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we generalize these results to Taub-Newman-Unti-Tamburino case and higher dimensions case.",
New submissions,Cosmological dynamics in the theory of gravity both with non-minimal and non-minimal derivative coupling,"Ravil R. Fatykhov,Sergey V. Sushkov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper explores cosmological scenarios in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity, including both a non-minimal coupling with scalar curvature of the form $R\phi^2$ and a non-minimal derivative coupling of the form $G^{\mu\nu}\phi_{,\mu}\phi_{,\nu}$ in the presence of a scalar field potential with the monomial dependence $V(\phi) = V_0\phi^n$. Critical points of the system were obtained and analyzed. In the absence of a scalar field potential, stability conditions for these points were determined. Using methods of dynamical systems theory, the asymptotic behavior of the model was analyzed. It was shown that in the case of $V(\phi)\equiv0$ or $n < 2$, a quasi-de Sitter asymptotic behavior exists, corresponding to an early inflationary universe. This asymptotic behavior in the approximation $V_0 \rightarrow 0,\ \xi \rightarrow 0$ coincides with the value $H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{9|\eta|}}$ obtained in works devoted to cosmological models with non-minimal kinetic coupling. For $|\xi|\ \rightarrow \infty$, this asymptotic behavior tends to the value $H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3|\eta|}}$. Moreover, unstable regimes with phantom expansion $w_{eff} < -1$ were found for the early dynamics of the model. For the late dynamics, the following stable asymptotic regimes were obtained: a power-law expansion with $w_{eff} \ge 1$, an expansion with $w_{eff} =\frac{1}{3}$ ($V(\phi)\equiv0$), at which the effective Planck mass tends to zero, and an exponential expansion with $w_{eff} = 0$ as $n = 2$. In this case, the asymptotic value of the Hubble parameter depends only on $V_0 = \frac{1}{2}m^2$ and $\xi$. Numerical integration of the model dynamics was performed for specific values of the theory parameters. The results are presented as phase portraits.",
New submissions,Scattering of massive neutrino test fields from a gravitational pulse,"Tekin Dereli,Yorgo Senikoglu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Linearized Einstein-Weyl equations are solved precisely in the context of sandwich gravitational waves. The neutrino's energy-momentum depends on the geometry and composition of the gravitational pulse when it is scattered. Since the background remains unchanged at the test field level, the neutrino's energy density will exhibit fluctuations between positive and negative extremes when traversing the sandwich wave. These variations could provide insights into the behavior of models concerning neutrino oscillations.",
New submissions,Testing black hole metrics with binary black hole inspirals,"Zhe Zhao,Swarnim Shashank,Debtroy Das,Cosimo Bambi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Gravitational wave astronomy has opened an unprecedented window onto tests of gravity and fundamental physics in the strong-field regime. In this study, we examine a series of well-motivated deviations from the classical Kerr solution of General Relativity and employ gravitational wave data to place constraints on possible deviations from the Kerr geometry. The method involves calculating the phase of gravitational waves using the effective one-body formalism and then applying the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework to constrain the parameters appearing in these scenarios beyond General Relativity. The effective one-body method, known for its capability to model complex gravitational waveforms, is used to compute the wave phase, and the post-Einsteinian framework allows for a flexible, model-independent approach to parameter estimation. We demonstrate that gravitational wave data provide evidence supporting the Kerr nature of black holes, showing no significant deviations from General Relativity, thereby affirming its validity within the current observational limits. This work bridges theoretical waveform modeling with observational constraints, providing a pathway to test the no-hair theorem and probe the astrophysical viability of modified black holes.",
New submissions,The Wave Function of the Universe and Inflation,Gerasimos Kouniatalis,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We develop a quantum-cosmological framework in which the inflationary potential emerges from the structure of the wave function of the universe rather than being postulated. Starting from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker minisuperspace, we express the wave function in terms of an amplitude and a phase and, in a semiclassical regime where the expansion dominates the field's evolution, separate these into purely geometric and purely field-dependent pieces. This yields a closed expression for an emergent potential that makes transparent the roles of the cosmological constant, the momenta associated with expansion and field dynamics, and quantum corrections from the amplitude. Slow-roll conditions follow from properties of the phase and amplitude, leading to wave-function-level expressions for the usual slow-roll parameters and to direct links between cosmic microwave background observables and derivatives of the phase. The approach ties inflation to the quantum state of the universe and suggests testable relationships between cosmological data and features of the wave function.",
New submissions,Inferring the spins of merging black holes in the presence of data-quality issues,"Rhiannon Udall,Sophie Bini,Katerina Chatziioannou,Derek Davis,Sophie Hourihane,Yannick Lecoeuche,Jess McIver,Simona Miller",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves from black hole binary mergers carry information about the component spins, but inference is sensitive to analysis assumptions, which may be broken by terrestrial noise transients known as glitches. Using a variety of simulated glitches and gravitational wave signals, we study the conditions under which glitches can bias spin measurements. We confirm the theoretical expectation that inference and subtraction of glitches invariably leaves behind residual power due to statistical uncertainty, no matter the strength (signal-to-noise ratio; SNR) of the original glitch. Next we show that low-SNR glitches - including those below the threshold for flagging data-quality issues - can still significantly bias spin inference. Such biases occur for a range of glitch morphologies, even in cases where glitches and signals are not precisely aligned in phase. Furthermore, we find that residuals of glitch subtraction can result in biases as well. Our results suggest that joint inference of the glitch and gravitational wave parameters, with appropriate models and priors, is required to address these uncertainties inherent in glitch mitigation via subtraction.",
Cross submissions,A Holographic prescription for generalized Schwinger-Keldysh contours,"Martin Ammon,Jette Germerodt,Christoph Sieling,Julio Virrueta",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We provide a holographic prescription to compute real-time thermal correlators with arbitrary operator ordering. In field theory, these correlation functions are captured by a multi-fold Schwinger-Keldysh time contour. We propose a holographic dual for these contours, which generalizes the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry previously advocated in the literature. Our geometry consists of multiple AdS-black holes glued together at the future and past horizons, with matching conditions determined by unitarity and the KMS condition. As a proof of concept, we solve for a probe scalar field in this geometry and compute bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary propagators, in terms of which we evaluate the 4-point functions at tree-level. We show that in perturbation theory, the lowest-order diagrams that contribute non-trivially to the out-of-time order four-point function are exchange diagrams which explore the full four-fold geometry. Furthermore, these diagrams reduce to a simple factorized expression. We propose a conjecture on the structure of higher order observables and provide a partial proof by studying a subset of the contributing diagrams.",
Cross submissions,Covariant cosmography in the presence of local structures: comparing exact solutions and perturbation theory,"Maharshi Sarma,Christian Marinoni,Basheer Kalbouneh,Chris Clarkson,Roy Maartens",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent observational evidence of axially symmetric anisotropies in the local cosmic expansion rate motivates an investigation of whether they can be accounted for within the Lema√Ætre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) framework with an off-center observer. Within this setting, we compute the exact relativistic luminosity distance via the Sachs equation and compare it with the approximate expression obtained from the covariant cosmographic approach (including Hubble, deceleration, jerk and curvature parameters). This comparison allows us to identify the regimes in which the covariant cosmographic method remains reliable. In addition, we compare the LTB relativistic distance for small inhomogeneities with the corresponding result derived from linear perturbation theory (LPT) in the standard cosmological model. This analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the LTB and LPT approaches, offering a consistent dictionary for the interpretation of the observed anisotropies of the large-scale gravitational field. This analysis will be instrumental in interpreting expansion-rate anisotropies, facilitating investigations of the local Universe beyond the FLRW framework with a fully non-perturbative metric approach.",
Cross submissions,Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries,Andrew James Bruce,Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.",
Cross submissions,Finding Supermassive Black Hole Binary Mergers in Pulsar Timing Array Data,"Sharon Mary Tomson,Boris Goncharov,Rutger van Haasteren",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Galaxy observations suggest there is about one merger of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) throughout the observable universe in a year. Here, we introduce the methodology to search for gravitational waves from these events with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs).Modelling the inspiral, the merger, the ringdown, and the gravitational wave memory components of the signal in simulated data, we demonstrate a proof of principle for detection and parameter estimation. We study a few representative SMBHB mergers with chirp masses spanning $10^{8} - 10^{10}~M_\odot$ at distances from a few Mpc to 100~Mpc to asses their detectability in PTA observations. Assuming the fixed binary inclination angle of $90^{\circ}$ corresponding to the maximum displacement memory signal, these signals appear distinct for a PTA with 25 pulsars timed for 13 years with 100 ns precision.We demonstrate the capabilities of PTAs to constrain chirp masses and distances of detected merging binaries, as well as to place limits. The sky position uncertainties of the order of $1^{\circ}$, which we find in this optimistic example, could potentially enable electromagnetic follow-up and multi-messenger observations of SMBHB mergers. Finally, we show that the measurement uncertainties on the parameters of simulated merging binaries depend weakly on the presence of the gravitational wave background with Hellings-Downs correlations in our simulated data.",
Cross submissions,Theoretical Modelling of Early Massive Black Holes,Marta Volonteri,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"These notes review theoretical models of massive black hole formation, growth and observables. They start with a brief summary of basic properties of massive black hole properties. The current view on massive black holes and active galactic nuclei at high redshift is then summarized, highlighting the JWST ``revolution'' and the questions raised by the recent observations. The notes then touch on massive black hole formation and growth mechanisms, emphasizing the processes at play at early cosmic times. Then techniques for modeling the cosmic massive black hole evolution, are reviewed with an emphasis on cosmological simulations, before approaching how observables are derived from models. They conclude with a section reflecting on the main questions on the JWST-discovered population in light of the material presented in the earlier sections.",
Cross submissions,Matching JWST UV Luminosity Functions with Refined $Œõ$CDM Halo Models,"Saeed Fakhry,Maryam Shiravand,Antonino Del Popolo",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$, posing a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo \textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at $z \gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.",

Price",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"When debris from a star that experienced a tidal disruption events (TDE) after passing too close to a massive black hole returns to pericenter on the second passage, it is compressed, leading to the formation of nozzle shocks (in the orbital plane) and pancake shocks (perpendicular to the orbital plane). Resolving these shocks is a long-standing problem in the hydrodynamic simulations of parabolic TDEs. Excessive numerical energy dissipation or heating unrealistically expands the stream. In this Letter, we apply adaptive particle refinement to our 3D general relativistic smoothed particle simulations to locally increase the resolution near the pericenter. We achieve resolutions equivalent to $6.55\times10^{11}$ particles, allowing us to converge on the true energy dissipation. We conclude that only $4\times10^{-5}$ of the orbital energy is dissipated in nozzle shocks for a Sun-like star tidally disrupted by a $10^6$ solar-mass black hole, therefore the nozzle shocks are unlikely to be important in the evolution of TDEs.",

In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. In this paper we consider the non-orientable Euclidean topologies \E{7}--\E{10}, \E{13}--\E{15}, and \E{17}, encompassing the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the CMB sky. We find that in manifolds where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about $1.2$ times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB, we expect a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. Our limited selection of manifold parameters are exemplary of interesting behaviors, but not necessarily representative. Future searches for topology will require a thorough exploration of the parameter space to determine what values of the parameters predict statistical correlations that are convincingly attributable to topology.[Abridged]",
