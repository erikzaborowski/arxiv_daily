New submissions,James Burkett Hartle: a Biographical Memoir,"Gary T. Horowitz,Kip S. Thorne",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph),"James Burkett Hartle was a theoretical physicist who made major contributions to our understanding of relativistic stars, black holes, and cosmology. Most of his career, however, was devoted to studying the universe as a quantum system. As a result, he was known as the father of quantum cosmology. He is best known for two seminal papers with Stephen Hawking that introduced two quantum states of fundamental importance: the ""Hartle-Hawking vacuum"" for matter fields outside a black hole, and the ""no-boundary wave function of the universe"" for cosmology. Jim (as everyone called him) was a warm and caring person who was genuinely concerned with the success of his students, postdocs, and colleagues. He was generous with his time and helped to foster a culture of a welcoming family among gravitational physicists.",
New submissions,"From geometry to cosmology: a pedagogical review of inflation in curvature, torsion, and extended gravity theories",Davood Momeni,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories. These include models based on curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. We explore how scalar fields interact with different geometric quantities and how these interactions affect inflationary dynamics. Key cosmological features such as background evolution, reheating, and observable parameters are discussed. We also examine exotic scenarios inspired by string theory, extra dimensions, and non-local models. This work aims to connect theoretical models with observational data and future missions, offering guidance for exploring inflation beyond general relativity.",
New submissions,Charting GLOBs in Asymptotically Safe Gravity,"Francesco Del Porro,Jonas Pfeiffer,Alessia Platania,Samuele Silveravalle",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Computing the gravitational effective action provides a direct route to charting the landscape of admissible black hole spacetimes and their alternatives, which we will collectively call ""gravitationally localized objects"" (GLOBs). In this work, we provide a proof of principle of this idea within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. Focusing on the Einstein-Weyl truncation, we identify the unique ultraviolet-complete trajectory emanating from the asymptotically safe fixed point and use it to extract the Wilson coefficient of the Weyl-squared term. This allows us to chart the corresponding GLOBs in a ""phase diagram"", showing that wormholes dominate a large portion of it, whereas the classical Bachian naked singularities become disfavored. Our results illustrate how quantum gravity can constrain effective field theory and the associated set of allowed spacetimes, yielding a rich landscape of beyond-general-relativity solutions rather than a single alternative to classical black holes.",
New submissions,Cosmological dynamical systems of non-minimally coupled fluids and scalar fields,"Hala A. Ashi,Christian G. Boehmer,Antonio d'Alfonso del Sordo,Erik Jensko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We study the cosmological dynamics of non-minimally coupled matter models using the Brown's variational approach to relativistic fluids in General Relativity. After decomposing the Ricci scalar into a bulk and a boundary term, we construct new models by coupling the bulk term to the fluid variables and an external scalar field. Using dynamical systems techniques, we study models of this type and find that they can give rise to both early-time inflationary behaviour and late-time accelerated expansion. Moreover, these models also contain very interesting features that are rarely seen in this context. For example, we find dark energy models which exhibit phantom crossing in the recent past. Other possibilities include models that give a viable past evolution but terminate in a matter-dominated universe. The dynamical systems themselves display an array of mathematically interesting phenomena, including spirals, centres, and non-trivial bifurcations depending on the chosen parameter values.",
New submissions,Trapped surface formation for the Einstein-Weyl spinor system,"Peng Zhao,Xiaoning Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),We prove trapped-surface formation for the Einstein-Weyl spinor system (gravity coupled to a massless left-handed two-spinor) without any symmetry assumption. To this end we establish a semi-global solution under double null foliation and show that the focusing of the gravitational waves and the Weyl spinor flux leads to the formation of a trapped surface.,
New submissions,Black Hole Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in the Presence of Gauss-Bonnet Trace Anomaly,"Rupam Jyoti Borah,Umananda Dev Goswami",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the effects of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravitational trace anomaly on the circular motion of test particles around black holes (BHs) and its implications for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in various theoretical models. Beginning with the equations of motion, we study the effects on effective potential, angular momentum, specific energy, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) induced by the anomaly parameter $\alpha$. The fundamental frequencies are calculated. Moreover, we examine several QPO models, including PR, RP, WD, TD, and ER2-ER4, and study the relationship between the upper and lower QPO frequencies as well as the corresponding resonance radii for frequency ratios of 1:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 5:4. Our results show that increasing $\alpha$ leads to deviations from the Schwarzschild case in both upper and lower QPO frequencies correlations and QPO orbital radii, with model-dependent trends. Further, we constrain the BH parameters using the observational data using MCMC analysis. Finally, we calculate the upper and lower QPO frequencies for a few BH candidates on the basis of the RP model using the constrained parameter values and find a good agreement with the observed results.",
New submissions,"Unified Framework for Geodesic Dynamics with Conservative, Dissipative, and GUP Effects","Gaurav Bhandari,S. D. Pathak,Harjit Ghotra",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD),"We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Quantum-gravity effects are introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.",
New submissions,Geodesics and Light Deflection in Schwarzschild-like Spacetime from Cosmology-Inspired Modified Gravity,"Ritesh Pandey,Shubham Kala,Amare Abebe,Hemwati Nandan,G.G.L. Nashed",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate cosmology-driven modifications to Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetimes and analyze their impact on photon propagation, gravitational lensing, and shadow observation. The gravitational deflection angle is computed using the Rindler-Ishak method, which incorporates finite-distance corrections and provides a consistent framework for non-asym-ptotically flat spacetimes. The effective potential for null geodesics exhibits a single unstable maximum corresponding to the photon sphere, and we study photon orbits classified according to the critical impact parameter into capture, escape, and unstable circular trajectories. Our analysis shows that the deflection angle decreases with increasing model parameter $(\alpha)$, resulting in weaker light bending compared to the Schwarzschild case. In addition, we examine the angular diameter of the black hole shadow as measured by a static observer, highlighting its dependence on the cosmological modification parameters. These results suggest that high-precision astrometric and lensing observations can place meaningful constraints on cosmology-inspired modifications to gravity, thereby linking astrophysical black holes with cosmic expansion and offering a novel probe of gravitational physics in strong-field regimes.",
New submissions,Lagrangian Dynamics of Spinning Pole-Dipole-Quadrupole Particles in Metric-Affine Geometries,Damianos Iosifidis,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We construct the Lagrangian formulation of a micro-structured spinning, dilating and shearing (deformable) test body, moving in arbitrary non-Riemannian backgrounds possessing all geometrical entities of curvature, torsion and non-metricity. We start with a Lagrangian of a generic form that depends on the particle's velocity, its material frame and its absolute derivative, and the background geometry consisting of a metric and an independent affine connection. Performing variations of the path and the material frame, we derive the equations of motion for the particle that govern the evolution of its momentum and hypermomentum in this generic background. The reported equations of motion generalize those of a spinning particle (Mathisson \cite{Mathisson:1937zz}, Papapetrou \cite{Papapetrou:1951pa}, Dixon \cite{Dixon:1974xoz}) by the inclusion of the dilation and shear (hadronic) currents of matter. Using the derived equations of motion, a generalized conserved quantity is also found. Further conserved quantities that can be obtained by appropriate supplementary conditions are also discussed.",
New submissions,A Comprehensive Framework for F-statistic-based Parameter Estimation of Binary Black Hole Signals,Hai-Tian Wang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present a comprehensive investigation of the F-statistic method for parameter estimation of gravitational wave (GW) signals from binary black hole mergers. By analytically maximizing the likelihood over the luminosity distance and polarization angle, this approach reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space to enhance computational efficiency. We also introduce a novel formulation for calculating the Bayes factor for the F-statistic, enabling a quantitative assessment of its performance against standard full frequency-domain (FFD) Bayesian inference. Using the benchmark event GW150914, we demonstrate that the F-statistic method is not only approximately $70\%$ faster than FFD but is also statistically stable across different sampler configurations, with a log-Bayes factor between runs smaller than $0.1$. Furthermore, the F-statistic exhibits superior stability against changes in sampler configuration, yielding consistently lower Jensen-Shannon divergence values between analysis runs. While the F-statistic produces slightly broader constraints on some parameters, we argue this represents a more honest uncertainty quantification, particularly in high-dimensional parameter spaces with complex posterior structures. These results highlight the significant advantages of the F-statistic method for GW data analysis, positioning it as a powerful tool for the era of high-rate detections with future observatories.",
New submissions,Residual Test for the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog,"Dicong Liang,Ning Dai,Yingjie Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The residual test is commonly used to check the agreement between the gravitational wave signal and the theoretical waveform template. The basic idea of the residual test is to subtract the best-fit waveform from the data and then check whether the remaining data (i.e., the residuals) are consistent with the instrumental noise or not. We apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Anderson-Darling test and the chi-squared test as goodness-of-fit test to examine the residuals of events in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog and find no statistically significant deviation from the noise. Although our method is sensitive only to the loud events, it does not rely on the cross-correlation between detectors. A single-detector event suffices for our residual analysis, and the test is simple and computationally inexpensive.",
New submissions,Can Hawking effect of multipartite state protect quantum resources in Schwarzschild black hole?,"Shu-Min Wu,Xiao-Wei Teng,Hui-Chen Yang,Rui-Yang Xu,P. H. M. Barros,H. A. S. Costa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Most previous studies on relativistic quantum information have primarily focused on the vacuum state $|0\rangle$ and the first excited state $|1\rangle$ in two-mode entangled systems. In this work, we go beyond these limitations by considering arbitrary $q$-th excited states $|q\rangle$, aiming to investigate their role in preserving quantum resources. We analyze the influence of the Hawking effect on multipartite quantum states in the Schwarzschild spacetime, with particular attention to quantum entanglement and coherence. Our results show that, under the influence of the Hawking effect, increasing the excitation number $q$ leads to a reduction in quantum entanglement and mutual information, while enhancing quantum coherence. This indicates that the Hawking effect on excited multipartite states tends to degrade quantum correlations but simultaneously protects quantum coherence in curved spacetime. Therefore, when implementing quantum information protocols in gravitational settings, reducing the excitation number $q$ is favorable for maintaining entanglement, whereas increasing $q$ may be advantageous for tasks that rely on quantum coherence in relativistic quantum information processing.",
New submissions,Importance of Shot Noise in the Search for an Isotropic Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background with Next Generation Detectors,"Haowen Zhong,Vuk Mandic",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We investigate the impact of shot noise on the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by binary neutron star mergers, and confirm that the overall background can be significantly influenced by relatively few neighboring, loud events. To mitigate the shot noise, we propose a procedure to remove nearby events by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Additionally, we quantify the cosmic/sample variance of the resulting background after notching, and we study the deviation between the cross-correlation measurement and the theoretical prediction of the background. Taking both effects into account, we find that the resulting sensitivity loss in the search for an isotropic background formed by binary neutron star mergers is minimal, and is limited to $\lesssim 4\%$ below 40 Hz, and to $\lesssim 1\%$ above 40 Hz.",
Cross submissions,Dissipation in Open Holography,"Andreas Karch,Merna Youssef",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We exploit the holographic realization of a conformal theory coupled to an external bath realized via a double trace deformation and its gravity dual in terms of transparent boundary conditions in order to map out some basic dissipative properties of this simple open holographic system. In particular, we determine the energy transmission coefficient across the boundary, discover a novel duality relating weak and strong coupling to the external bath, and quantify the dissipation in the system by working out the quasi normal modes.",
Cross submissions,Towards a holographic description of closed universes,Hong Liu,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study baby closed universes in AdS, focusing on the Antonini-Sasieta-Swingle (AS$^2$) cosmology, which arises in the gravitational description of partially entangled thermal states (PETS), as well as the classical example of Maldacena-Maoz (MM). We show that the algebraic formulation of AdS/CFT--and in particular the subregion-subalgebra duality--provides a natural framework for describing such universes within the standard AdS/CFT setting, phrased in terms of an operator algebra ${\cal M}$ and a state $\omega$ on that algebra, with no need to introduce observers. The algebra encodes all physical operations in the closed universe, and, in principle, all physical observables are obtainable from the pair $({\cal M},\omega)$. Along the way, we propose a resolution to a puzzle raised by Antonini and Rath (AR) and reinforced by recent arguments of Engelhardt and Gesteau and a no-go theorem of Gesteau: that a semiclassical baby universe in the AS$^2$ cosmology cannot be understood from the boundary in the usual manner. Our analysis motivates an averaged large-$N$ limit as part of the AdS/CFT dictionary and points toward a unified treatment of spacetimes of all asymptotics in terms of operator algebras. Finally, our boundary descriptions of closed universes indicate that for small but finite $G_N$ there should exist a semiclassical description of a macroscopic closed universe, rather than a one-dimensional Hilbert space, and we discuss weaknesses in arguments favoring the latter.",
Cross submissions,Gauge symmetry and the arrow of time: How to count what counts,Sean Gryb,History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This thesis addresses two major problems in the philosophy of physics. The first is how to identify the minimal physical content of a theory; that is, what features of a theory are truly needed to make predictions, and what can be removed without changing its empirical consequences. The second is the problem of time's arrow: why time seems to have a direction, even though the fundamental laws of physics treat the past and future symmetrically.I show that answering the first question leads to insights about the second. In particular, I argue that the overall size of the Universe is not used to make predictions in cosmology, and so should not count as part of the theory's minimal physical content. Describing the Universe without this feature leads to a striking result: the arrow of time becomes a local phenomenon. Observers like us who see a Universe full of matter clumped together to form structures like stars and planets are statistically much more likely to see increasing clumpiness into the future than into the past. This tendency helps explain our experience of time's direction.",
Cross submissions,Large-order perturbation theory of linear eigenvalue problems,Stephen Jonathan Chapman,Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We consider a class of linear eigenvalue problems depending on a small parameter epsilon in which the series expansion for the eigenvalue in powers of epsilon is divergent. We develop a new technique to determine the precise nature of this divergence. We illustrate the technique through its application to four examples: the anharmonic oscillator, a simplified model of equitorially-trapped Rossby waves, and two simplified models based on quasinormal modes of Reissner-Normstrom de Sitterblack holes.",
Cross submissions,Anisotropic critical points from holography,"Dimitrios Giataganas,Umut Gürsoy,Claire Moran,Juan F. Pedraza,David Rodríguez Fernández",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a comprehensive analysis of generic 5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) holographic theories with exponential couplings. We find and classify exact, analytic, anisotropic solutions, both zero-temperature vacua and finite-temperature black brane backgrounds, with anisotropy sourced by scalar axions, magnetic fields, and charge densities, that can be interpreted as IR fixed points of renormalisation-group flows from UV-conformal fixed points. The resulting backgrounds feature a hyperscaling violation exponent and up to three independent Lifshitz-like exponents, generated by an equal number of independent coupling constants in the EMDA action. We derive the holographic stress-energy tensor and the corresponding equation of state, and discuss the behavior of the anisotropic speed of sound and butterfly velocity. We show that these theories can be consistently constrained by imposing several natural requirements, including energy conditions, thermodynamic stability, and causality. Additionally, we analyse hard probes in this class of theories, including Brownian motion, momentum broadening and jet quenching, and we demonstrate that a fully analytic treatment is possible, making their dependence on the underlying anisotropy explicit. We highlight the relevance of these models as benchmarks for strongly coupled anisotropic matter in nature, from the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions to dense QCD phases in neutron-star mergers and the cores of compact objects.",
Cross submissions,Domain Wall Skyrmions in Holographic Quantum Chromodynamics: Topological Phases and Phase Transitions,"Suat Dengiz,İzzet Sakallı",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We investigate the domain wall skyrmions phase in the framework of holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Building on previous work regarding chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) in strong magnetic fields, we study the emergence of localized skyrmions a top domain walls formed by CSLs. These skyrmions, realized as undissolved D4-branes embedded in the D8-branes, carry baryon number two and exhibit complex topological and energetic features. We explore the interplay between magnetic field strength, pion mass, and baryon chemical potential in stabilizing these configurations and demonstrate the existence of a mixed CSL-skyrmions phase. Through systematic energy analysis, we establish that the domain wall skyrmions become energetically favorable when $\mu_B |B| \gtrsim \Lambda \cdot m_\pi f_\pi^2$, with the transition occurring around $\mu_B |B| \sim 4.5$ in our holographic framework. Our phase diagram reveals three distinct regions: the CSL phase at low chemical potential and magnetic field, the domain wall skyrmions phase at intermediate scales, and a conjectured skyrmions crystal phase at the highest densities. The instanton density profiles $\text{Tr}(F \wedge F)$ show sharp localization in the domain wall skyrmions phase, contrasting with the smooth, extended distribution characteristic of the pure CSL configuration. These findings provide non-perturbative insights into baryonic matter in the dense QCD and offer a geometrical picture of topological phase transitions via string theory duality, with potential applications to neutron star physics and the broader QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions.",
Cross submissions,New formalism for perturbations of massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes,Kieran Wood,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a new technique for studying the perturbations of dRGT-type massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes. Built initially from the vielbein formulation of the theory, but switching back to the metric formulation afterwards, our approach bypasses many of the complications that arise in previous metric formulation approaches to linearising massive gravity around generic backgrounds, naturally elucidates the ghost-free structure of the interactions, and readily generalises to higher orders in perturbation theory, as well as to multiple interacting metric tensor fields. To demonstrate the power of our technique, we apply our formalism to a number of commonly occurring example backgrounds - proportional, cosmological, and black hole - recovering and extending many known results from the literature at linear order. Lastly, we provide, for the first time, the cubic order multi-gravity potential around a generic background spacetime.",
Cross submissions,Heterotic Warm Inflation,"Arjun Berera,Heliudson Bernardo,Suddhasattwa Brahma,Jaime Calderón-Figueroa,Rudnei O. Ramos,Michael W. Toomey",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this paper we propose a two-field model of warm inflation motivated from a heterotic string construction. The model contains an axion and a dilaton-like field. We show that while warm inflation can take place in the axion-field direction, thermal corrections coming from the radiation gauge fields, which couples to both the axion and the dilaton, prevent warm inflation to happen in the dilaton-field direction. We explore the background dynamics for different parameters, and identify a diversity of dynamical behaviors allowed in this model, denoting different regimes of warm inflation.",
Cross submissions,Parameterizing quasi-quintessence and quasi-phantom fields without the nearly flat potential approximation,"Anna Chiara Alfano,Youri Carloni",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"An alternative dark energy description based on a generalized K-essence scenario is here explored. In particular, we consider a \emph{quasi-quintessence} and/or \emph{quasi-phantom} field, whose pressure does not depend on the kinetic energy, firstly discussed in the context of the cosmological constant problem. In so doing, we fix the background evolution and investigate the main observational signatures of its corresponding fluid-like representation. The corresponding scalar field can be parameterized independently from the potential form and without imposing the condition $\omega \sim -1$ used for quintessence and phantom fields. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters by performing Monte-Carlo Markov chain simulations through the adoption of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and perform separated analyses, employing different data catalogs. More precisely, as data sets we employ observational Hubble data, type Ia supernovae and the second data release from the DESI Collaboration, namely DESI DR2. We define a hierarchy among analyses and, precisely, in the first we adopt all three samples, while the second excludes the DESI data points, with the aim of facing its effect on corresponding bounds. Our findings suggest that the \emph{quasi-quintessence} scenario prefers Planck's value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, but suggesting that, when the DESI sample is excluded from our computations, $\omega_0$ enters the phantom regime, although still compatible at $1$-$\sigma$ confidence level with a cosmological constant. Remarkably, these results appear in tension than those found for a standard quintessence, explored within the context of the recent DESI release, likely indicating that the DESI data may furnish inconclusive results depending on the kind of scalar field involved into the computation.",
