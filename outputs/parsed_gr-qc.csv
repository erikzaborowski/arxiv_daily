New submissions,Scalar quasinormal modes of magnetically charged black holes in a quintessence field,Ali Hasnain,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum for scalar perturbations of static, magnetically charged black holes in the presence of a quintessence field. The background geometry is obtained from the Einstein-Power-Maxwell action with a Kiselev-type contribution for quintessence. The associated master wave equation is solved using complementary numerical approaches, including high-order WKB expansions, the asymptotic iteration method, and time-domain integration, with cross-validation to ensure accuracy. The results show that magnetic charge generally lowers the oscillation frequency of fundamental modes, while the quintessence parameter modifies damping timescales. A dedicated analysis of the metric's derivation confirms the correct form of the magnetic charge term. We explore a theoretical parameter space to understand the mathematical behavior of the solution, including extreme regimes not intended to represent astrophysical realities. The computed scalar field spectra provide a foundational study for future work on gravitational perturbations. All numerical data and codes are provided to ensure reproducibility.",
New submissions,Systematic errors in fast relativistic waveforms for Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals,"Hassan Khalvati,Philip Lynch,Ollie Burke,Lorenzo Speri,Maarten van de Meent,Zachary Nasipak",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Accurate modeling of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is essential for extracting reliable information from future space-based gravitational wave observatories. Fast waveform generation frameworks adopt an offline/online architecture, where expensive relativistic computations (e.g. self-force and black hole perturbation theory) are performed offline, and waveforms are generated rapidly online via interpolation across a multidimensional parameter space. In this work, we investigate potential sources of error that result in systematic bias in these relativistic waveform models, focusing on radiation-reaction fluxes. Two key sources of systematics are identified: (i) the intrinsic inaccuracy of the flux data, for which we focus on the truncation of the multipolar mode sum, and (ii) interpolation errors from transitioning to the online stage. We quantify the impact of mode-sum truncation and analyze interpolation errors by using various grid structures and interpolation schemes. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetime with spins larger than $a \geq 0.9$, we find that $\ell_{\text{max}} \geq 30$ is required for the necessary accuracy. We also develop an efficient Chebyshev interpolation scheme, achieving the desired accuracy level with significantly fewer grid points compared to spline-based methods. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetimes, we demonstrate via Bayesian studies that interpolating the flux to a maximum global relative error that is equal to the small mass ratio is sufficient for parameter estimation purposes. For 4-year long quasi-circular EMRI signals with SNRs$= \mathcal{O}(100)$ and mass-ratios $10^{-4}-10^{-6}$, a global relative error of $10^{-6}$ yields mismatches $<10^{-3}$ and negligible parameter estimation biases.",
New submissions,Probing Direct Waves in Black Hole Ringdowns,"Naritaka Oshita,Sizheng Ma,Yanbei Chen,Huan Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Merger gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescence carry rich information about the underlying spacetime dynamics. We analyze merger waves from comparable-mass and extreme-mass-ratio binaries, obtained from numerical relativity and black-hole perturbation theory, respectively, and argue that they are dominated by the prompt wave emissions as the black holes collide. This signal, which we refer to as the direct wave, is modulated by the plunging motion and selectively screened by the gravitational potential of the remnant black hole. The direct wave typically exhibits a time-dependent frequency and decay rate, but for high-spin remnants $(\gtrsim0.7)$ the ergosphere renders it mode-like, with a quasi-stable instantaneous oscillation frequency close to the superradiant frequency. We further estimate its detectability in a GW150914-like system and find that the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed $\sim 10$ with the current ground-based detector network. Our results therefore identify the direct wave as a robust observable for analyzing black hole ringdowns in current and future gravitational wave events.",
New submissions,Higher-order gravity models: corrections up to cubic curvature invariants and inflation,"C. M. G. R. Morais,G. Rodrigues-da-Silva,L. G. Medeiros",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We construct a higher-order gravity model including all corrections up to mass dimension six. Starting from the Jordan frame, we derive the field equations and specialize to the FLRW background, where the dynamics take the form of a four-dimensional autonomous system. Focusing on the $R+R^{2}+RR_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ case, we obtain linearized equations in the parameter $\gamma_{0}$ and analyze the resulting phase space. The model exhibits the main desirable features of an inflationary regime, with a slow-roll attractor and a stable critical point corresponding to the end of inflation. Analytical expressions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ show that the model is consistent with Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data if $|\gamma_{0}|\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Moreover, negative values of $\gamma_{0}$ restore compatibility with recent ACT, Planck and DESI results, suggesting that higher-order corrections may play a relevant role in refining inflationary cosmology.",
New submissions,Cosmology in warped massive gravity,"Sebastian Garcia-Saenz,Yuxiang Wei,Xue Zhou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the cosmological dynamics and predictions in the theory of warped massive gravity. This set-up postulates a five-dimensional ghost-free massive graviton with a brane-localized four-dimensional massive gravity potential, and has the virtue of raising the strong-coupling scale of the 4D theory. We identify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale factor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary conditions for the Stückelberg fields and one characterized by a special tuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials. In the first case, we find interesting solutions including a cosmological bounce without the need of exotic matter. The second case leads to a modified Friedmann equation, and comparison with data shows the potential of the model to alleviate the Hubble tension.",
New submissions,Frozen Neutron Stars,"Chen Tan,Yong-Qiang Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate neutron stars with nonlinear magnetic monopoles in the framework of the Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics model, specifically within the Bardeen and Hayward models. Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state, we find that upon reaching the critical magnetic charge $q_{c}$, neutron stars enter frozen states characterized by the critical horizon. This extends the concept of frozen states to compact objects composed of ordinary matter (non-field matter), thereby offering a new perspective for related research.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics of Einstein-Geometric Proca AdS compact objects,"Asalkhon Alimova,Elham Ghorani,Beyhan Puliçe,Farruh Atamurotov,Ahmadjon Abdujabbarov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study we explore metric-Palatini gravity extended by the antisymmetric component of the affine curvature. This gravitational theory results in general relativity plus a geometric Proca field. Building on our previous work, where we constructed its static spherically symmetric solutions in the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) background (Eur. Phys. J. C 83(4):318, 2023), we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the system's thermodynamics. We examine the thermodynamic properties of the Einstein-Geometric Proca AdS compact objects, focusing on the Hawking temperature, enthalpy, heat capacity, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Particular attention is given to the dependence of the Hawking temperature, enthalpy, and heat capacity on the uniform potential $q_{1}$ and the electromagnetic-type charge $q_{2}$. Through numerical analysis we compute the entropy and Gibbs free energy and investigate how these quantities vary with the model parameters.",
New submissions,Backreaction equations for 1+1 dimensional BEC sonic black holes,"Roberto Balbinot,Alessandro Fabbri,Giorgio Ciliberto,Nicolas Pavloff",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"As in the gravitational context, one of the most challenging open question in analogue black holes formed in Bose-Einstein condensates concerns the backreaction of Hawking-like radiation on the condensate and its subsequent evolution. In this work we derive the basic equations describing this backreaction within the density-phase formalism, which avoids infrared divergences and is particularly well suited to one-dimensional configurations.",
New submissions,Exploring Coupled Quintessence in light of CMB and DESI DR2 measurements,"Atul Ashutosh Samanta,Abhijith Ajith,Sukanta Panda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We perform a detailed analysis of a theoretically motivated dark energy quintessence model which interacts with the dark matter sector of the universe. Utilising the current observational datasets from the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Type Ia Supernovae, we constrain the parameters that characterise the strength of the time dependent interaction. We also look at the effect of a warm dark matter component in the context of coupled quintessence. Analysis using Deviance Information Criterion indicates strong preference for the quintessence model coupled with warm dark matter. However, Bayesian evidence analysis shows favor in the direction of $\Lambda$CDM model.",
New submissions,Ultralight Boson Ionization from Comparable-Mass Binary Black Holes,"Yuhao Guo,Zhen Zhong,Yifan Chen,Vitor Cardoso,Taishi Ikeda,Lihang Zhou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally bound states analogous to molecules once the binary separation decreases below the boson's Bohr radius, with the inner region co-moving with the binary. We simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions, demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.",
Cross submissions,Theoretical and experimental basis for excluding Einstein-Cartan theory within the USMEG-EFT framework,Farrukh A. Chishtie,General Physics (physics.gen-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The USMEG-EFT framework~\cite{ChishtieEFT2025,ChishtieBreakdown2023} provides systematic quantum gravity through with 4D General Relativity (GR) achieving Standard Model-gravity unification. This work examines Einstein-Cartan theory against McKeon et al.'s claims~\cite{BrandtFrenkelMcKeon2024,McKeonBrandtFrenkel2025} regarding its viability for unification. McKeon et al.'s 2024 analysis omitted key interaction terms, missing Einstein-Cartan's central content. Their 2025 claim that unification requires Einstein-Cartan is incorrect. When fermions are included, Einstein-Cartan generates non-renormalizable four-fermion interactions producing catastrophic quartic divergences $\sim \kappa^4\Lambda^4$. Precision experiments exclude the theory: MICROSCOPE constrains equivalence principle violations at $10^{-15}$ while Einstein-Cartan predicts $10^{-12}$ effects. In contrast to these claims, the USMEG-EFT framework achieves unification using standard 4D GR through constraints, producing finite results with calculable coefficients while remaining experimentally compatible.",
Cross submissions,Massive Spinning Fields During Inflation: Feynman rules and correlator comparison,"Trevor Cheung,David Stefanyszyn",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider the dynamics of massive spinning fields during inflation and the resulting signatures in the cosmological correlators of inflaton perturbations computed in the Poincaré patch of de Sitter space. There are (at least) two ways to describe the fluctuations of such new spinning degrees of freedom and these are distinguished by the symmetries of the de Sitter group that they linearly realise. The primary question we ask is: do these two set-ups yield distinct signatures in cosmological observables? After systematically deriving the Feynman rules for exchange diagrams consisting of massive spinning fields, where we discover the necessity of \textit{effective propagators} that augment the naive Schwinger-Keldysh ones by delta functions corresponding to instantaneous propagation, we show that the two set-ups are indistinguishable at the level of the inflaton bispectrum but distinguishable at the level of the trispectrum and other higher-point correlation functions. The bispectrum is special since in the corresponding tree-level Feynman diagrams, only the helicity-zero modes of the spinning fields can propagate. The bispectrum correspondence holds up to the addition of contact diagrams arising from the self-interactions of the inflaton, and is consistent with the symmetries of the effective field theory inflation. Our results suggest that the cosmological collider signals in the bispectrum are universal and do not depend on the detailed description of the massive spinning field.",
Cross submissions,Reionization optical depth and CMB-BAO tension in punctuated inflation,Zhiqi Huang,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.",
Cross submissions,"Machine Learning Confirms GW231123 is a ""Lite"" Intermediate Mass Black Hole Merger","Chayan Chatterjee,Kaylah McGowan,Suyash Deshmukh,Karan Jani",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported GW231123, a black hole merger with total mass of around 190-265 solar mass. This event adds to the growing evidence of ""lite"" intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) discoveries of post-merger black holes >100 solar mass. GW231123 posed several data analysis challenges owing to waveform-model systematics and presence of noise artifacts called glitches. We present the first comprehensive machine learning analysis to further validate this event, strengthen its astrophysical inference, and characterize instrumental noise in its vicinity. Our approach uses a combination of tools tailored for specific analyses: GW-Whisper, an adaptation of OpenAI's audio transformer, ArchGEM, a Gaussian mixture model-based soft clustering and density approximation software and AWaRe, a convolutional autoencoder. We identify the data segment containing the merger with >70% confidence in both detectors and verify its astrophysical origin. We then characterize the scattered light glitch around the event, providing the first physically interpretable parameters for the glitch. We also reconstruct the real waveforms from the data with slightly better agreement to model-agnostic reconstructions than to quasi-circular models, hinting at possible astrophysics beyond current waveform families (such as non-circular orbits or environmental imprints). Finally, by demonstrating high-fidelity waveform reconstructions for simulated mergers with total masses between 100-1000 solar mass, we show that our method can confidently probe the IMBH regime. Our integrated framework offers a powerful complementary tool to traditional pipelines for rapid, robust analysis of massive, glitch-contaminated events.",
Cross submissions,Interacting k-essence field with non-pressureless Dark Matter: Cosmological Dynamics and Observational Constraints,"Saddam Hussain,Qiang Wu,Tao Zhu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a class of interacting dark energy and dark matter (DM) models, where dark energy is modeled as a $k$-essence scalar field with an inverse-square potential. Two general forms of interaction are considered: one proportional to the Hubble parameter, and another independent of the Hubble parameter, depending instead on combinations of the energy densities and pressures of the dark sectors. The dynamics are analyzed using a dynamical system stability framework by constructing an autonomous system of equations. The models are tested against a wide range of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), BAO measurements from DESI DR2, compressed Planck data (PLA), Pantheon+ (PP), DES supernovae, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and strong lensing data from H0LiCOW (HCW). The analysis shows that the models consistently reproduce all major cosmological epochs and yield statistically competitive results compared to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The models exhibit stable late-time de-Sitter solutions, ensuring ghost-free evolution, with the Hubble constant in the range $H_0 \sim 67$--$70$ km/s/Mpc.",
Cross submissions,Brans-Dicke-like field for co-varying $G$ and $c$: observational constraints,"J. Bezerra-Sobrinho,R. R. Cuzinatto,L. G. Medeiros,P. J. Pompeia",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Ref. [Symmetry 15 (2023) 709] introduced a Brans-Dicke-like framework wherein the scalar field $\phi$ is composed of both $G$ and $c$ which, for this reason, co-vary according to $c^{3}/G=\text{constant}$. In this paper, we use observational data to constrain the supposed co-varying $G$ and $c$. The datasets include SN Ia, BAO and the value of $\theta$ extracted from CMB data. A proxy function is demanded for the varying $c$ since the framework does not provide a closed set of equations for computing the functional form of either $G$ or $c$ uniquely. Accordingly, we choose three separate parameterizations for $c\left(z\right)$ inspired both by desirable properties of the varying speed of light (VSL) and by successful phenomenological models from the literature -- including the one by Gupta (CCC framework in e.g. Ref. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 498 (2020) 4481-4491]. When combined with DESI, Pantheon+ data strongly favor a variable speed of light with more than $3\sigma$ confidence level for all parameterizations considered in this paper, whereas Union2.1 suggests no variation of the speed of light. As we shall demonstrate, this apparent discrepancy is due to a strong correlation that emerges between $H_0$ and VSL.",
Cross submissions,Investigating the cosmic distance duality relation with gamma-ray bursts,"Anna Chiara Alfano,Carlo Cafaro,Salvatore Capozziello,Orlando Luongo,Marco Muccino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Deviations from the so-called {\it cosmic distance duality relation} may result from systematic errors in distance measurements or, more interestingly, hint at new physics. Further, it can also be related to the Hubble constant tension between early and local measurements of $H_0$. Based on this, we test validity of this relation through a model-independent parameterization of the Hubble rate via the well-estabilished Bézier polynomials approach. We seek for possible departures from the relation considering three parametrizations, i) a power-law correction, ii) a logarithmic correction and iii) a Padé series $P_{n,m}(z)$ of order (1;2) with $n=1$ being the order of the numerator while $m=2$ is the order of the denominator. Then, assuming a flat scenario, we test them through Monte Carlo -- Markov chain analyses that combine low- and intermediate/high-$z$ data sets, such as observational Hubble data, the Pantheon catalog of type Ia supernovae, galaxy clusters, the second data release from the DESI Collaboration and gamma-ray bursts. In particular, we distinguish between \emph{Analysis A} and \emph{Analysis C}, depending whether the prompt emission $E_{iso}-E_p$ or the prompt-afterglow $L_0-E_p-T$ gamma-ray burst correlations, respectively, is fit together with the other probes previously described. Our results seem to point towards a \emph{no violation} of the cosmic distance duality relation and a preference towards Planck's value of $H_0$.",
Cross submissions,Fixed points of classical gravity coupled with a Standard-Model-like theory,"Latham Boyle,Neil Turok,Vatsalya Vaibhav",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Coupling quantum field theory (QFT) \!-\! even free QFT \!-\! to gravity leads to well-known problems. In particular, the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ (gravity's source) and its correlators typically diverge in the UV, creating a conflict between the wildly inhomogeneous spacetime we expect quantum mechanically and the weakly-curved, macroscopic spacetime we observe. Are there QFTs for which these divergences cancel? Here, for simplicity, we consider free quantum fields on a classical curved background. The aforementioned divergences are related to the running of the gravitational couplings. We calculate the corresponding beta functions, identifying a special class of QFTs with UV fixed points at which $\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle$ and all its correlators $\langle T\ldots T\rangle$ are UV finite. An intriguing example is a theory like the Standard Model (including right-handed neutrinos) with $12$ gauge fields, $3$ generations of $16$ Weyl fermions and $36$ four-derivative (Fradkin-Tseytlin) scalars. In the infrared, this theory has a positive Newton's constant $G$ and an arbitrarily small cosmological constant $\Lambda$.",
Cross submissions,Towards systematic search for white dwarf binaries with multiband photometry,"Alice Perego,Astrid Lamberts,Mathias Schultheis,Nelson Christensen",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Ultra-compact double white dwarfs (DWDs) represent key targets for multi-messenger astrophysics, as they may be observed both through gravitational waves and the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect thousands of these systems, and they are predicted to be the most numerous science targets of the mission. We develop a strategy to identify LISA source candidates in multiband photometric surveys. We constructed a synthetic EM catalogue of white dwarf (WD) detections based on a population synthesis code combined with a semi-analytical model of the Milky Way and a consistent cooling model for the evolution. We compared sources in the LISA band with other WD observations in magnitude-colour and colour-colour plots. From a full sky survey with $u \le$24.5, we find that 57$\%$ of the sources in the LISA band occupy a specific region in colour-colour diagrams. Inside this area, we find that $\sim 63\%$ (6.5 $\times 10^4$) of EM observations are LISA candidates, $\sim 31\%$ ($ 3.2 \times 10^4$) are DWDs slightly outside the LISA frequency range, and only a small contamination comes from single WDs and wider binaries. We find that the colour distributions of close DWDs represent a powerful tool to distinguish potential LISA sources from the broader WD population. This is an avenue to select candidates for further follow-up and identification.",
Cross submissions,Quantum signatures of proper time in optical ion clocks,"Gabriel Sorci,Joshua Foo,Dietrich Leibfried,Christian Sanner,Igor Pikovski",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph),"Optical clocks based on atoms and ions probe relativistic effects with unprecedented sensitivity by resolving time dilation due to atom motion or different positions in the gravitational potential through frequency shifts. However, all measurements of time dilation so far can be explained effectively as the result of dynamics with respect to a classical proper time parameter. Here we show that atomic clocks can probe effects where a classical description of the proper time dynamics is insufficient. We apply a Hamiltonian formalism to derive time dilation effects in harmonically trapped clock atoms and show how second-order Doppler shifts (SODS) due to the vacuum energy (vSODS), squeezing (sqSODS) and quantum corrections to the dynamics (qSODS) arise. We also demonstrate that the entanglement between motion and clock evolution can become observable in state-of-the-art clocks when the motion of the atoms is strongly squeezed, realizing proper time interferometry. Our results show that experiments with trapped ion clocks are within reach to probe relativistic evolution of clocks for which a quantum description of proper time becomes necessary.",
Cross submissions,Trispectrum in Extended USR Model with Transition to SR,"Hassan Firouzjahi,Amin Nassiri-Rad",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),We study the trispectrum in a two-phase USR-SR setup of inflation in which the USR stage is extended in the initial phase of inflation while the second stage of inflation proceeds via a slow-roll phase. A key role is played by the sharpness parameter which controls how quickly the system reaches the final attractor phase after the USR stage. We employ both $\delta N$ and in-in formalisms and calculate trispectrum and the corresponding dimensionless parameters $g_{NL}$ and $\tau_{NL}$. We show that both approaches yield the same results and study the shapes of trispectrum in various configurations. It is shown that the maximum value of trispectrum occurs in the setup with an infinitely sharp transition to the attractor phase while much of trispectrum is washed out in the opposite limit of a mild transition.,
Cross submissions,Nonlinear Independent Component Analysis Scheme and its application to gravitational wave data analysis,"Jun'ya Kume,Koh Ueno,Tatsuki Washimi,Jun'ichi Yokoyama,Takaaki Yokozawa,Yousuke Itoh",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Noise subtraction is a crucial process in gravitational wave (GW) data analysis to improve the sensitivity of interferometric detectors. While linear noise coupling has been extensively studied and successfully mitigated using methods such as Wiener filtering, subtraction of non-linearly coupled and non-stationary noise remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel independent component analysis (ICA)-based framework designed to address non-linear coupling in noise subtraction. Building upon previous developments, we derive a method to estimate general quadratic noise coupling while maintaining computational transparency compared to machine learning approaches. The proposed method is tested with simulated data and real GW strain data from KAGRA. Our results demonstrate the potential of this framework to effectively mitigate complex noise structures, providing a promising avenue for improving the sensitivity of GW detectors.",

Gayathri,Giuliano Iorio,Hiromichi Tagawa,Daniel Wysocki,Jeremiah Anglin,Imre Bartos,Shubhagata Bhaumik,Zolt'an Haiman,Michela Mapelli,R. O'Shaughnessy,LingQin Xue",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The astrophysical origin of binary black hole mergers discovered by LIGO and Virgo remains uncertain. Efforts to reconstruct the processes that lead to mergers typically rely on either astrophysical models with fixed parameters, or continuous analytical models that can be fit to observations. Given the complexity of astrophysical formation mechanisms, these methods typically cannot fully take into account model uncertainties, nor can they fully capture the underlying processes. Here, we present a merger population analysis that can take a discrete set of simulated model distributions as its input to interpret observations. The analysis can take into account multiple formation scenarios as fractional contributors to the total set of observations, and can naturally account for model uncertainties. We apply this technique to investigate the origin of black hole mergers observed by LIGO Virgo. Specifically, we consider a model of AGN assisted black hole merger distributions, exploring a range of AGN parameters along with several {SEVN} population synthesis models that vary in common envelope efficiency parameter ($\alpha$) and metallicity ($Z$). We estimate the posterior distributions for AGN+SEVN models using $87$ BBH detections from the $O1--O3$ observation runs. The inferred total merger rate is $46.2 {Gpc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}$, with the AGN sub-population contributing $21.2{Gpc}^{-3}{yr}^{-1}$ and the SEVN sub-population contributing $25.0 {Gpc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}$.",
