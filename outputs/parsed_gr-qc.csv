New submissions,Impact of Buchdahl metric potential on thin-shell gravastar framework in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley like massive gravity,"Meghanil Sinha,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This paper presents a study on gravitational vacuum stars (gravastars) with an isotropic matter distribution in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity incorporating Buchdahl metric function. Here we have conducted an analysis on thin-shell singularity-free gravastar configuration. The study demonstrates the viability of gravastars as alternatives to black holes (BHs) in this massive gravity. Our research yields singularity free analytical solutions for gravastar interior and without event horizon. Our discussion focuses on the properties of the thin shell of ultra-relativistic stiff fluid viz., length, energy, entropy and the massive gravity's impact on these physical properties. The junction conditions have been carefully examined and study of surface redshift analysis implies regularity of the model. Our investigation also includes energy condition analysis supporting the thin shell formation. Thus our solutions eliminate singularities and information paradoxes and the implications of these solutions are seemingly noteworthy and exhibit physical desirable properties.",
New submissions,Accretion of Dark Energy Candidates Following Redshift Parametrization Type Equation of State : Horava-Lifshitz Gravity,"Promila Biswas,Sukanya Dutta,Ritabrata Biswas,Farook Rahaman",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this article, accretion of particular dark energy candidates is studied. These dark energy models possess equation of state dependent on redshift and some free parameters. Central gravitating object for this accretion model is chosen to be the Kehagias Sfetsos black hole sitting in Horava Gravity. Four special redshift parametrization models, viz. Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, Jassal-Bagala-Padmanabhan, Barboza-Alcaniz and Barboza-Alcaniz-Zhu-Silva are picked to study different accretion properties. Formation of critical point and related radial infalling speed, sonic speed, different arbitrary parameters' values etc are obtained. Mass growth curves are plotted. The rate of growth is followed to depend on the dark matter's behavior as well as the free parameters of dark energy models. Future loss in mass is noted for some of the chosen dark energy models.",
New submissions,Planar black holes and black bounces with flat exterior,"Hideki Maeda,Cristian Martinez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present $n(\ge 4)$-dimensional planar black holes and black bounces with a flat exterior, which are originated by an exact solution in general relativity. The interior regions of these black objects are described by the extended dynamical region inside a non-degenerate Killing horizon of Gamboa's static plane symmetric solution with a perfect fluid obeying a linear equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$. The matter field inside the horizon is not a perfect fluid but an anisotropic fluid that may be interpreted as a spacelike (tachyonic) perfect fluid. While it satisfies the null and strong energy conditions in the black-hole case, it violates all the standard energy conditions in the black-bounce case. The metric on the horizon is not analytic but at least $C^{1,1}$ in the single-null coordinates in both cases, so it is regular and there is no lightlike massive thin shell on the horizon.",
New submissions,The metric from energy-momentum non-conservation: Generalizing Noether and completing spectral geometry,Achim Kempf,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We complete the program of spectral geometry, in the sense that we show that a manifold's shape, i.e., its metric, can be reconstructed from its resonant sound when tapped lightly, i.e., from its spectrum, -- if in addition we also record the resonances' mutual excitation pattern when the driving is strong enough to reach the nonlinear regime. Applied to spacetime, this finding yields a generalization of Noether's theorem: the specific pattern of energy-momentum non-conservation on a generic curved spacetime, encoded within the quantum field theoretic scattering matrices, is sufficient to calculate the metric. Applied to quantum gravity, this shows that the conventional dichotomy of spacetime versus matter can emerge from an underlying information-theoretic framework of only one type of quantity: abstract correlators, $G^{(n)}$, that are, a priori, merely operators on $n$ tensor factors of a Hilbert space. This is because, on one hand, if abstract higher-order correlators $G^{(n>2)}$ can be diagonalized, these correlators can be represented as local quantum field theoretic vertices on a curved spacetime whose metric $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ can be explicitly calculated. On the other hand, at sufficiently high energies, such as the Planck scale, the $G^{(n)}$ may not be even approximately representable as correlators of a local QFT on a spacetime, indicating a regime that is mathematically controlled but transcends the concepts of spacetime and matter.",
New submissions,Gravitational Scattering of Two Neutron Stars,"Joan Fontbuté,Sebastiano Bernuzzi,Piero Rettegno,Simone Albanesi,Wolfgang Tichy",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present the first numerical relativity simulations of the gravitational scattering of two neutron stars. Constraint-satisfying initial data for two equal-mass non-spinning sequences are constructed at fixed energy and various initial angular momenta (impact parameter) and evolved with Einstein equations through the scattering process. The strong-field scattering dynamics are explored up to scattering angles of $225^\circ$ and the threshold of dynamical captures. The transition to bound orbits is aided by significant mass ejecta up to baryon mass ${\sim}1M_\odot$. A quantitative comparison with predictions of the scattering angle from state-of-the-art effective-one-body and post-Minkowskian calculations indicates quantitative agreement for large initial angular momenta although significant discrepancies in the tidal contribution emerge towards the capture threshold. Gravitational waveforms and radiated energy are in qualitative agreement with the analogous black hole problem and state-of-the-art effective-one-body predictions. Towards the capture threshold waveforms from scattering dynamics carry a strong imprint of matter effects, including the stars' $f$-mode excitations during the close encounter. Overall, our simulations open a new avenue to study tidal interactions in the relativistic two-body problem.",
New submissions,"GUP, Lorentz Invariance (Non)-Violation, and Non-Commutative Geometry","Michael Bishop,Daniel Hooker,Peter Martin,Douglas Singleton",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we formulate a generalized uncertainty principle with both position and momentum operators modified from their canonical forms. We study whether Lorentz symmetry is violated and whether it can be saved with these modifications. The requirement that Lorentz invariance is not violated places restrictions on the way the position and momentum operators can be modified. We also investigate the connection between general uncertainty principle and non-commutative geometry models, e.g.,laying out the connection between area/area operators and angular momentum in both models.",
New submissions,Stealth black hole solutions in higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories,Masato Minamitsuji,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories. We do not particularly focus on the degenerate classes of theories. For several specific choices of the coupling functions, we show that in the presence of the ordinary Maxwell kinetic term the Reissner-Nordström-(anti-)de Sitter solution in the pure Maxwell-Einstein theory can also be a solution in generic classes of higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories, and in the absence of the ordinary Maxwell kinetic term the Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter solution with the nonzero electric field can be obtained. This corresponds to a stealth black hole solution as the electric field does not affect the spacetime geometry. We then focus on several degenerate classes of higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories, and find that the dyonic Reissner-Nordström-(anti-)de Sitter solution in the pure Maxwell-Einstein theory can be a solution.",
New submissions,Manifestation of quantum entanglement between harmonic oscillators in de Sitter,"Sumanta Chakraborty,Anupam Mazumdar,Ritapriya Pradhan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Two harmonic oscillators interacting through the exchange of a quantum field leads to non-zero entanglement between the two, which is absent for classical interaction. In this work, we determine the entanglement between two such harmonic oscillators living in an expanding universe. It turns out that, if the oscillators are within the Hubble horizon, with their frequencies are comparable to the rate of expansion of the universe, the entanglement is non-zero and significant. While, for oscillators outside the Hubble horizon, with oscillation frequencies much higher than the expansion rate, the entanglement is negligibly small.",
New submissions,Radii of spherical timelike geodesics in Kerr-Newman black holes,"Wei Huang,Jun-Xu Chen,Jia-Hui Huang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The existence, radii and radial stability of the equatorial and non-equatorial (particularly, the polar) spherical orbits are discussed for particles with different conserved energy. The radii of these orbits generally are solutions of a quintic polynomial equation with four dimensionless parameters. For the case with $\gamma=1$, we obtain the analytical expressions for the radii of the polar, equatorial and general orbits. The radial stability of the orbits outside the event horizon is also discussed. In the $(u, w, \beta)$ space, a no-orbit surface is found. When the parameters lies on this surface there is no orbit outside the event horizon, otherwise there is always one spherical orbit outside the event horizon. For the cases with $\gamma\neq1$, we focus on the study of polar and equatorial orbits. For polar orbits with $0<\gamma<1$, a boundary surface in $(u, w, \gamma)$ space is identified which determines the existence of spherical polar orbits outside the event horizon. Numerical results of the radii and radial stability of the polar orbits are shown for examples with specific values of $\gamma$. For polar orbits with $\gamma>1$, it is found that there is always one unstable orbit outside the event horizon. For equatorial orbits with $0<\gamma<1$, in each rotating case (prograde case and retrograde case), a boundary surface in $(u, w, \gamma)$ space is also identified which divides the parameter space into two regions: one region with two orbits (one stable and the other unstable) and the other with no orbit outside the event horizon. Parameters on the boundary surface correspond to ISCOs. An analytical formula for the ISCOs is derived by choosing $(w,\gamma)$ as independent variables. For equatorial orbits with $\gamma>1$, it is found that there is always one unstable orbit outside the event horizon.",
New submissions,Non-Equatorial Deflection of Light due to Kerr-Newman Black Hole: A Material Medium Approach,"Saswati Roy,Shubham Kala,Prasanjit Ghosh,Hemwati Nandan,Asoke K. Sen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explored the effect of space-time geometry on the trajectory of light rays in the context of a charged, rotating black hole. We derived an analytical expression for the deflection of light rays in Kerr-Newman space-time geometry, using a material medium approach, on non-equatorial plane. From this deflection angle expression it is evident that the charge and rotation of the black hole can affect the light rays' paths. Additionally, we calculated the refractive index of light rays by treating space-time as a medium. We demonstrated how the rotation parameter and charge influence the refractive index and hence the deflection angle of light rays. For Kerr-Newman geometry, the deflection angle decreases with increasing charge when the rotation parameter is held constant. Conversely, for a constant charge, the deflection angle increases with the rotation parameter for prograde and decreases for retrograde trajectories. Applying both factors results in the deflection angle being lower than that of the Schwarzschild geometry. Non-equatorial study of the deflection angle reveals that it is maximum in the equatorial plane than in the pole. The frame-dragging effects in the Kerr-Newman field were taken into account to calculate the velocity of light rays, leading to the determination of the refractive index in this field geometry. This study concludes that depending on the values of the rotation parameter and charge parameter both prograde and retrograde trajectories coincide, resulting in the conclusion that at some point the frame dragging effect is the same for prograde and retrograde motion. Also, the frame dragging increases towards poles for retrograde trajectories while decreasing for prograde trajectories, and these nontrivial nature results because of the interplay between charge and rotation.",
New submissions,Gödel-type universes in unimodular gravity,"R. Raimarda,A. F. Santos,R. Bufalo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, the Gödel-type universes are examined within the framework of unimodular gravity. Since the existence of Gödel solutions is intrinsically related to the presence of a cosmological constant in general relativity, one can naturally wonder how the acausal structure of the Gödel solutions behaves in different cosmological scenarios. One of the simplest, but important, frameworks within this context is the unimodular gravity, in which the cosmological constant emerges as an integration constant rather than a coupling constant. Hence, the validity of Gödel-type solutions is scrutinized within the unimodular approach, examining whether this theory can address the known issue of causality violation in Gödel universes. In detail, it is demonstrated that for certain gravitational sources, both causal and non-causal regions are permissible.",
New submissions,Phase space and Data analyses of a non-minimally coupled scalar field system with decaying dark energy model,"Yerlan Myrzakulov,Saddam Hussain,M. Shahalam",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate a class of scalar field dark energy models non-minimally coupled to gravity, characterized by a double exponential potential and parameterized coupling {\xi}. First, we study the cosmological dynamics for a recently proposed Q-SC-CDM model. Initially, we choose two distinct values of {\xi}: 0.1 and 0.5. In case of {\xi}=0.1, the evolution of the universe is split up into three different phases: deceleration, acceleration and slow-contraction, and provide Big Crunch Singularity at distant future. However, in case of {\xi}=0.5, the phase of slow-contraction vanishes, correspondingly Big Crunch Singularity is redundant. Second, we perform the phase space analysis for Q-SC-CDM, bring new asymptotic regimes and find stable de-Sitter solution. Finally, fixing {\xi} to two representative values: {\xi} = 0.1 and 0.05, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using recent late-time cosmological observations, including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (DESI DR2) data. Our results demonstrate that both models yield constraints on key cosmological parameters \Omega_{0m}, H_0 and the sound horizon r_d that are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM within 68\% confidence level, yet exhibit mild tension with Pantheon+ measurements. We analyze the evolution of the effective equation of state, showing that the model transitions from a stiff matter phase at high redshift to a dark energy dominated phase with effective equation of state less than -0.5 at late times. Additionally, we employ the Om(z) diagnostic to distinguish our model from {\Lambda}CDM, finding minimal deviation up to redshift z \sim 2. Statistical model comparison using Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) Information Criteria reveals moderate support for the model with {\xi} = 0.1, though {\Lambda}CDM remains statistically preferred.",
New submissions,Binary systems as gravitational wave detectors,"Diego Blas,Adrien Bourgoin,Joshua F. Foster,Aurelien Hees,Miriam Herrero-Valea,Alexander C. Jenkins,Xiao Xue",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"``Adding colour'' to the gravitational-wave sky by probing unexplored frequency bands has the potential to unveil new and unexpected phenomena in the Universe. In these proceedings, we summarise current efforts to probe gravitational waves with $\mu$Hz frequencies through their resonant impact on binary systems. We also discuss how these binaries can explore uncharted regions of parameter space in the hunt for dark matter.",
New submissions,No dynamical CPT symmetry restoration in quantum gravity,"Astrid Eichhorn,Marc Schiffer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"CPT symmetry is at the heart of the Standard Model of particle physics and experimentally very well tested, but expected to be broken in some approaches to quantum gravity. It thus becomes pertinent to explore which of the two alternatives is realized: (i) CPT symmetry is emergent, so that it is restored in the low-energy theory, even if it is broken beyond the Planck scale, (ii) CPT symmetry cannot be emergent and must be fundamental, so that any approach to quantum gravity, in which CPT is broken, is ruled out. We explore this by calculating the Renormalization Group flow of CPT violating interactions under the impact of quantum fluctuations of the metric. We find that CPT symmetry cannot be emergent and conclude that quantum-gravity approaches must avoid the breaking of CPT symmetry. As a specific example, we discover that in asymptotically safe quantum gravity CPT symmetry remains intact, if it is imposed as a fundamental symmetry, but it is badly broken at low energies if a tiny amount of CPT violation is present in the transplanckian regime.",
Cross submissions,The building blocks of asymptotically flat spacetimes,Shadi Ali Ahmad,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The classification of all possible induced representations arising from theories admitting a Poincaré symmetry has molded our very conception of particles in flat space. In this note, we argue that if one takes the same viewpoint on the asymptotic symmetry group instead of the global one, the familiar relativistic classification is enhanced to provide a new notion of excitations in asymptotically flat spacetimes. These excitations blur the line between the quantum description of a particle and a spacetime geometry, and will appear in any theory with the same symmetry. By interacting together, they produce both the geometry of and propagating particles in spacetime.",
Cross submissions,Large-Scale-Structure Observables in General Relativity Validated at Second Order,"Antoine Villey,Yonadav Barry Ginat,Vincent Desjacques,Donghui Jeong,Fabian Schmidt",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a second-order calculation of relativistic large-scale-structure observables in cosmological perturbation theory, specifically the ""cosmic rulers and clock"", which are the building-blocks of any other large-scale-structure observable, including galaxy number counts, on large scales. We calculate the scalar rulers (longitudinal perturbation and magnification) and the cosmic clock to second order, using a fully non-linear covariant definition of the observables. We validate our formulae on three non-trivial space-time metrics: two of them are null tests on metrics which are obtained by applying a gauge transformation to the background space-time, while the third is the ""separate universe"" curved background, for which we can also compute the observables exactly. We then illustrate the results by evaluating the second-order observables in a simplified symmetric setup. On large scales, they are suppressed over the linear contributions by $\sim 10^{-4}$, while they become comparable to the linear contributions on mildly non-linear scales. The results of this paper form a significant (and the most complicated) part of the relativistic galaxy number density at second order.",
Cross submissions,Merger History of Clustered Primordial Black Holes,Viktor Stasenko,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Primordial black hole (PBH) binaries experience strong gravitational perturbations in the case of their initial clustering, which significantly affects the dynamics of their mergers. In this work, we develop a new formalism to account for these perturbations and track the evolution of the binary orbital parameters distribution. Based on this approach, we calculate the merger rate of PBH binaries and demonstrate that its temporal evolution differs greatly from that of isolated binary systems. Moreover, PBH clustering produces distinctive features in the stochastic gravitational-wave background: the canonical $2/3$ spectral slope transforms to $\Omega_{\rm gw} \propto \nu^{-65/28}$ in a certain frequency band. These predictions can be probed in future gravitational wave observations, opening up new opportunities to test the clustering of PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.",
Cross submissions,Geometric Cosmology models: statistical analysis with observational data,"Matías Leizerovich,Luisa G. Jaime,Susana J. Landau,Gustavo Arciniega",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Although the standard cosmological model is capable of explaining most current observational data, it faces some theoretical and observational issues. This is the main motivation for exploring alternative cosmological models. In this paper, we focus on a novel proposal that consists in adding an infinite tower of higher-order curvature invariants to the usual Einstein-Hilbert action. We obtain the late-time background evolution for three families of models that can be obtained from this proposal. We use recent data from Cosmic Chronometers and type Ia supernovae to test the late-time predictions of our models. In addition, we consider estimations from the Age of the Older Globular Clusters to constrain our models. While some of the studied cases are ruled out by the data, we show that there are particular cases of the GILA model that can explain current data.",
Cross submissions,Asymptotics and Scattering for Critically Weakly Hyperbolic and Singular Systems,"Bolys Sabitbek,Arick Shao",Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study a very general class of first-order linear hyperbolic systems that both become weakly hyperbolic and contain lower-order coefficients that blow up at a single time $t = 0$. In ""critical"" weakly hyperbolic settings, it is well-known that solutions lose a finite amount of regularity at the degenerate time $t = 0$. In this paper, we both improve upon the results in the weakly hyperbolic setting, and we extend this analysis to systems containing critically singular coefficients, which may also exhibit significantly modified asymptotics at $t = 0$.In particular, we give precise quantifications for (1) the asymptotics of solutions as $t$ approaches $0$; (2) the scattering problem of solving the system with asymptotic data at $t = 0$; and (3) the loss of regularity due to the degeneracies at $t = 0$. Finally, we discuss a variety of applications for these results, including to weakly hyperbolic and singular wave equations, equations of higher order, and equations arising from relativity and cosmology, e.g. at big bang singularities.",
Cross submissions,Addressing the $H_0$ tension through matter with pressure and no early dark energy,"Youri Carloni,Orlando Luongo,Marco Muccino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose that the Hubble tension arises due to an unaccounted additional component, that behaves as \emph{matter with pressure}. We demonstrate that this fluid remains subdominant compared to both dust and radiation throughout nearly the entire universe expansion history. Specifically, the additional fluid satisfies the Zel'dovic limit with a constant equation of state, $\omega_s > 0$, and a quite small normalized energy density, $\Omega_s$. Accordingly, this component modifies both the sound horizon and the background expansion rate, \emph{acting quite differently from early dark energy models}, without significantly affecting the other cosmological parameters. To show this, we perform a Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis of our model, hereafter dubbed $\Lambda_{\omega_s}$CDM paradigm, using the publicly available \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code. Our results confirm the presence of this fluid, with properties that closely resemble those of radiation. We find best-fit values that satisfy $\omega_s \lesssim \omega_\gamma$ and a relative energy density $\Omega_s / \Omega_\gamma = 0.45$, with $\omega_r$ and $\Omega_r$ the equation of state and density of photons, respectively. The effective fluid may be associated with generalized K-essence models or, alternatively, with Proca-type vector fields, albeit we do not exclude \emph{a priori} more exotic possibilities, i.e., dark radiation, axions, and so on. Physical implications of our results are analyzed in detail, indicating a statistical preference for the $\Lambda_{\omega_s}$CDM scenario over the conventional $\Lambda$CDM background.",
Cross submissions,Numerical analysis of quasiperiodic oscillations in the Hartle-Thorne spacetime,"K. Boshkayev,T. Konysbayev,Ye. Kurmanov,M. Muccino,H. Quevedo",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We numerically analyze quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) using a well-established spacetime model with neutron star sources. Within the framework of general relativity, we present expressions for the fundamental frequencies of test particles in the gravitational field of a slowly rotating and slightly deformed compact object defined by the Hartle-Thorne (HT) metric. Using the Relativistic Precession Model (RPM) formulated by Stella and Morinsk, we examine quasiperiodic oscillation data from eight neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems. Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, we estimate 1-$\sigma$ and 2-$\sigma$ error bars. Finally, we compare our results with predictions from the Schwarzschild, Lense-Thirring, and Kerr metrics, demonstrating that three of the eight sources can be well explained within the Hartle-Thorne model.",
Cross submissions,Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the Weighted Function Regression method,"Alex González-Fuentes,Adrià Gómez-Valent",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed.",
Cross submissions,"Soft Photon, Gluon and Graviton Theorems in (A)dS from Conformal Invariance","Jiajie Mei,Yuyu Mo",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present new soft theorems for photon, gluon, and graviton correlators at tree level in (Anti)-de Sitter space. The results are derived by applying conformal Ward identities to constrain the structure of Witten diagrams.",
Cross submissions,Superluminal Quantum Reference Frames,"Amrapali Sen,Matthias Salzger,Łukasz Rudnicki",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"While particles cannot travel faster than the speed of light, nor can information, this assumption has over the years been frequently questioned. Most recently, it has been argued [New J. Phys. 22, 033038 (2020)] that in a world with superluminal observers local determinism is impossible, linking the two pillars of physics-quantum theory and relativity-suggesting that the latter serves as the foundation for the former. Motivated by this approach, in this work, we extend the framework of quantum reference frames to incorporate superluminal Lorentz transformations. We apply this conceptual result to examine an apparent paradox where particles acquire negative energies after undergoing a superluminal Lorentz boost and propose a resolution within our framework. We also discuss Bell experiments under superluminal quantum reference frame transformations, showing that involved probabilities remain conserved.",
Cross submissions,Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice II: Nonperturbative Curvature Perturbation,"Angelo Caravano,Gabriele Franciolini,Sébastien Renaux-Petel",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Building on the recent lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics presented inarXiv:2410.23942, we investigate the role of the nonlinear relation between the inflaton field configuration and the curvature perturbation $\zeta$, the key observable after inflation. Using a nonperturbative $\delta N$ approach applied to the lattice output, we generate fully nonlinear three-dimensional maps of $\zeta$. This calculation captures both the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear mapping between $\phi$ and $\zeta$, and the intrinsic non-Gaussianity generated around Hubble crossing by the nonlinear field dynamics, which is neglected in stochastic approaches. We find that the nonlinear mapping has a profound impact on the statistics, significantly enhancing the positive tail of the $\zeta$ probability distribution, with important implications for observable quantities. A central part of this work is the comparison with the standard perturbative treatment based on a gauge transformation, which allows us to quantify when and how the perturbative picture breaks down as fluctuations grow large. Together witharXiv:2410.23942, this work sets the basis for robust, nonperturbative predictions of primordial black hole production and scalar-induced gravitational wave emission from inflation using lattice simulations.",
Cross submissions,InflationEasy: A C++ Lattice Code for Inflation,Angelo Caravano,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"InflationEasy is the first lattice code specifically developed for cosmological inflation. It simulates the nonlinear dynamics of a scalar field on a three-dimensional lattice in an expanding FLRW universe, using finite-difference spatial derivatives and a staggered leapfrog integrator for time evolution. Based in part on the well-known LATTICEEASY, it incorporates several improvements tailored to inflationary applications. Among other features, InflationEasy implements a nonperturbative $\delta N$ method to compute the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation $\zeta$ directly from the lattice, enabling fully nonlinear studies of scenarios with large fluctuations or nonperturbative non-Gaussianities. The code supports a broad range of inflationary models, including those relevant for primordial black hole formation, gravitational wave production, and large-scale structure. This makes InflationEasy a versatile and lightweight tool for studying inflationary dynamics beyond the reach of perturbation theory.",
Cross submissions,The Central Emission Vertex of two gravitons,"Damiano Barcaro,Vittorio Del Duca",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It has recently been shown that there exists an $s$-channel sequence of classical corrections to the $H$ diagram computed long ago by Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano. At leading logarithmic accuracy, those corrections feature the gravity BFKL kernel as a crucial element, and may be computed through either rapidity renormalisation group equations or amplitudes built through $s$-channel unitarity cuts. In this paper, we evaluate six-graviton amplitudes in next-to-multi-Regge kinematics, and compute for the first time the Central Emission Vertex for the emission of two gravitons, which is relevant to evaluate the corrections to the gravity BFKL kernel, and thus to go beyond the leading logarithmic accuracy.",
Cross submissions,On the Gravitational Origin of the QCD Axion,"Georgios K. Karananas,Mikhail Shaposhnikov,Sebastian Zell",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Gravity can give rise to (pseudo)scalar fields, for instance due to torsion. In particular, axions of gravitational origin have been proposed as a minimal and compelling solution to the strong CP problem. In this work, we critically examine the feasibility of this approach. We demonstrate that models in which the scalar field couples to fermionic currents only through derivatives do not yield a satisfactory axion. Moreover, we identify the necessary conditions for generating a gravitational axion through quantum effects, highlighting Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity as a promising theoretical setting.",
Cross submissions,The Volume-Renormalized Mass from a Hamiltonian Perspective,"Mattias Dahl,Klaus Kroencke,Stephen McCormick",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We demonstrate that the volume-renormalized mass for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds recently introduced by the authors can be deduced from a reduced Hamiltonian perspective. In order to do this, we first use Michel's formalism of mass invariants to extend the definition of the volume-renormalized mass to initial data sets.We consider spacetimes that are foliated by asymptotically Poincaré--Einstein Riemannian manifolds in the spirit of the Milne model of cosmology and reduce the ADM Hamiltonian to an unconstrained Hamiltonian system, analogous to the work of Fischer and Moncrief for spatially compact spacetimes. We find that the reduced Hamiltonian in this case recovers the volume-renormalized mass. We then analyze the first and second variation of the reduced Hamiltonian and demonstrate that it is non-increasing over the evolution and constant only for self-similar spacetimes.",

Cross submissions,On the prospects of thermalization of axion-SU(2) inflation,"Sukannya Bhattacharya,Matteo Fasiello,Alexandros Papageorgiou,Ema Dimastrogiovanni",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Axion inflation models coupled to a gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of conservative criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.",
Cross submissions,Acoustically driven dark matter freeze-out,"Iason Baldes,Ryusuke Jinno",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We extend the study of the effect of density perturbations to the well known thermal dark matter freeze-out scenario. We find $\sim 10 \, \%$ enhancements in the cross section are required to match onto the observed relic abundance for primordial curvature perturbations $\sim 0.2$ at length scales $\sim 1/$Hubble at freeze-out. Such corrections may be of importance in scenarios in which such perturbations are present and observational signals, such as the indirect detection rate, depend sensitively on the DM mass and freeze-out cross section, e.g. near resonances associated with DM bound states.",
Cross submissions,Special Functions and Geometries in Scattering Amplitudes: From Particle Physics to Gravity,Roger Morales,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This thesis focuses on the fields of scattering amplitudes and Feynman integrals, with an emphasis on the geometries and special functions that they involve, and is devoted to two distinct research directions. In the first half of the thesis, we explore elliptic Feynman integrals in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (N = 4 SYM) theory. In particular, we study elliptic generalizations of ladder diagrams, identifying the first two families of Feynman integrals involving the same elliptic curve to all loop orders, which provide a great testing ground for developing mathematical tools that can facilitate the calculation of elliptic integrals. In this direction, we initiate the symbol bootstrap for elliptic Feynman integrals, for which we generalize the so-called Schubert analysis to predict elliptic symbol letters. As a proof of principle, we obtain for the first time the symbol of the two-loop twelve-point elliptic double-box integral, resulting in a compact, one-line formula. In the second half of the thesis, we pioneer a systematic investigation of the Feynman integral geometries that are relevant to the study of gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of black-hole mergers within the post-Minkowskian expansion of classical gravity. Specifically, we classify the geometries and special functions appearing in the expansion up to four loops. Among other findings, we identify the first Calabi-Yau three-dimensional geometry relevant to gravitational-wave physics. Subsequently, we study the Feynman integral giving rise to this Calabi-Yau geometry in more detail, and solve it by bringing its differential equation into canonical form - a step that required developing a new method that accommodates for apparent singularities.",
