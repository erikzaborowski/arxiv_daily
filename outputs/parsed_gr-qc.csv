New submissions,"Non-singular bouncing cosmology in $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity with energy condition violations","A. Zhadyranova,M. Koussour,V. Zhumabekova,N. Zhusupova,S. Muminov,J. Rayimbaev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The singularity and inflationary problems have posed significant challenges for understanding the universe's origin and evolution. Bouncing cosmology has emerged as a promising alternative to standard cosmological models, offering a non-singular approach to early universe dynamics by facilitating a ""bounce"" rather than a singular beginning. In this study, we explore the feasibility of modeling specific bouncing scenarios within the framework of $ f(T, \mathcal{T}) $ gravity, allowing for a comprehensive coupling between the torsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$. We analyze two $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ models: a linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = \alpha T + \beta \mathcal{T}$ and a non-linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = \alpha \sqrt{-T} + \beta \mathcal{T}$, with a parameterized scale factor $a(t) = \sqrt{a_0^2 + \gamma^2 t^2}$ to capture the bounce behavior. The analysis confirms a cosmic bounce at $t = 0 $, where the Hubble parameter $H = 0$ signals a transition from contraction to expansion. A crucial condition for achieving the bounce is the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce, enabling the equation of state (EoS) parameter to enter the phantom region ($\omega < -1$). Both models exhibit an increase in energy density as the universe approaches the bounce, peaking at the bounce epoch and then decreasing post-bounce. Pressure remains negative throughout, with the EoS parameter crossing into the phantom region near the bounce in both positive and negative time zones. Our findings show that NEC and strong energy condition (SEC) violations are essential for the non-singular bounce, while the dominant energy condition (DEC) is satisfied, ensuring a consistent matter distribution...",
New submissions,Doubly Separable Spacetimes and Symmetry Constraints on their Self-Gravitating Matter Content,"Prashant Kocherlakota,Ramesh Narayan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"A popular approach to constructing exact stationary and axisymmetric nonvacuum solutions in general relativity has been to use solution-generating techniques. Here we revisit a recent variant of the Newman-Janis-Azreg-Ainou algorithm, restricted to asymptotically-flat spacetimes, and demonstrate that this method exclusively generates Konoplya-Stuchlik-Zhidenko spacetimes. Therefore, the equations for geodesic motion and scalar-wave propagation are both separable. We call these ""doubly separable"" spacetimes. We identify a subclass of the spacetimes that might admit a separable Dirac equation by explicitly obtaining the Killing-Yano tensor. The high degree of symmetry in these spacetimes suggests that the self-gravitating matter must also be in specialized field configurations. For this reason, we investigate whether these spacetimes can even be sourced by arbitrary types of matter. We show that doubly separable spacetimes cannot be sourced by massless real scalar fields or perfect fluids, and that electromagnetic fields lead only to the Kerr-Newman family. Notably, this rules out the elusive spinning counterpart of the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity spacetime, which contains a scalar field, as a member of this metric class. While the algorithm generates spacetimes with rich symmetry structures, valuable for studying phenomena like black hole shadows and quasinormal modes, our results highlight the need for caution when using it to construct physically consistent solutions with prespecified matter content.",
New submissions,Horizon quantum geometries and decoherence,"Max Joseph Fahn,Alessandro Pesci",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"There is mounting theoretical evidence that black hole horizons induce decoherence on a quantum system, say a particle, put in a superposition of locations, with the decoherence functional, evaluated after closure of the superposition, increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. This phenomenon has been shown to owe its existence to soft modes, that is modes with very low frequencies, of the quantum fields -- sourced by the particle -- which pierce through the horizon, or also can be understood as coming from the interaction with the black hole described as a thermodynamic quantum system at Hawking's temperature. Here we investigate the effects of ensuing quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the horizon, in an effective perspective in which the quantum geometry of the horizon is captured by existence of a limit length or by horizon area quantisation. We show that the discreteness of the energy levels associated to the different geometric configurations might have strong impact on the results, in particular reducing the decoherence effects even to a negligible level in case of quanta of area $A_0 = \mathcal{O}(1) \, \, l_p^2$ or larger, with $l_p$ the Planck length.",
New submissions,"White dwarf structure in $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity: beyond the Chandrasekhar mass limit","Edson Otoniel,Juan M. Z. Pretel,Clésio E. Mota,César O. V. Flores,Victor B. T. Alves",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"In this work, we investigate the relativistic structure of white dwarfs (WDs) within the framework of modified gravity theory $f(R, T, L_m) = R + \alpha T L_m$, which introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Using a realistic equation of state (EoS) that includes contributions from a relativistic degenerate electron gas and ionic lattice effects, we solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for two standard choices of the matter Lagrangian density: $L_m = p$ and $L_m = -\rho$. We show that the extra $\alpha TL_m$ term significantly alters the mass-radius relation of WDs, especially at high central densities $( \rho_c \gtrsim 10^8 - 10^9\,\rm g/cm^3)$, allowing for stable super-Chandrasekhar configurations. In particular, depending on the sign and magnitude of the parameter $\alpha$, the maximum mass can increase or decrease, and in some regimes, the usual critical point indicating the transition from stability to instability disappears. Our findings suggest that $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity provides a viable framework to explain the existence of massive WDs beyond the classical Chandrasekhar limit.",
New submissions,Effects of matter with anisotropic pressure on the Fan-Wang regular black hole shadows,"Yergali Kurmanov,Orlando Luongo,Daulet Berkimbayev,Kuantay Boshkayev,Talgar Konysbayev,Marco Muccino,Guldana Rabigulova",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We here investigate the consequences of an exotic fluid, exhibiting negative radial and tangential pressures, \emph{de facto} violating the Zel'dovich limit, on a regular solution that easily generalizes the Schwarzschild black hole. More precisely, we focus on the regular Fan-Wang spacetime, computing how the black hole shadow images, surrounded by the quoted fluid, is modified through the presence of \emph{negative} equations of state for the two pressure components. Even though quite different from quintessence, we consider constant radial and tangential equations of state with the aim of emulating, but not reproducing, dark energy effects. Moreover, we explore the main properties of infalling spherical accretion flows and, accordingly, the influence of the equations of state on the horizons, photosphere, and impact parameter of the Fan-Wang black hole. Afterwards, we examine the luminosities of the shadow and the photon ring in two distinct spherically accretion flows, as well as the observed specific intensity of the shadow itself. Last but not least, we physically interpret the impact of negative pressures on our findings and discuss possible extensions to the isotropic case.",
New submissions,Radial oscillations of neutron stars in Starobinsky gravity and its Gauss-Bonnet extension,"Ziyi Li,Zhong-Xi Yu,Zhe Luo,Shoulong Li,Hongwei Yu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Starobinsky gravity, as one of the simplest and best-behaved higher-curvature gravity theories, has been extensively studied in the context of neutron stars over the past few decades. In this work, we investigate the adiabatic radial oscillation stability of neutron stars within the framework of Starobinsky gravity. We find that gravitational modifications can significantly impact stellar stability. Specifically, the higher-derivative nature of the theory causes the exterior spacetime to dynamically respond to fluid oscillations, in contrast to general relativity where Birkhoff's theorem ensures a static exterior. For stellar models with low central densities, the fundamental frequency becomes nearly independent of the central density when the coupling constant is large. For stellar models with high central densities, the transition from stability to instability still approximately occurs near the maximum-mass configuration, similar to the case in general relativity. Our main analysis is conducted in the Jordan frame of the scalar-tensor gravity equivalent to Starobinsky gravity, and we explicitly verify consistency with results obtained in the Einstein frame. We further extend our study to a class of Gauss-Bonnet extensions of Starobinsky gravity.",
New submissions,Relativistic scalar dark matter drag forces on a black hole binary,"Shuo Xin,Elias R. Most",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Dark matter around black holes can induce drag forces through dynamical friction and accretion, potentially affecting the orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission of binary systems. While dynamical friction from scalar field dark matter has been studied in the relativistic regime for single black holes, the case of a binary black hole (BBH) has remained unexplored. As a first step, we present a series of two-dimensional general-relativistic simulations of BBH in a wind tunnel for an asymptotically homogeneous scalar field background. We extract the drag forces, torque, mass and charge accretion acting on the binary, and analyze their dependence on the binary separation, velocity and the scalar field parameters. We find that the binary's drag is not a simple superposition of two isolated black holes; the presence of a companion modifies the gravitational wake and yields significant nonlinearities. This additional force and torque can (in principle) modify the inspiral and induce a dephasing of the gravitational wave signal.",
New submissions,$F(ϕ)T$-Gravity and Inflationary Natural Model,"Feyzollah Younesizadeh,Davoud Kamani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"By applying a particular kind of modified gravity, we study the inflation. Precisely, we extend our investigations beyond the Einstein's gravity to explore the Natural inflation model via the term $F(\phi)T$. We compute the inflation dynamics to derive the slow-roll parameters, i.e., the tensor-to-scalar ratio ``$r$'' and the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$''. This modified form of the gravity yields not only the predictions of the original models but also better-fitting with the Planck/BICEP/Keck data.",
New submissions,Kalb-Ramond Black Holes Sourced by ModMax Electrodynamics: Some Perturbative Properties in the Phantom Sector,"Y. Sekhmani,A. Baruah,S. K. Maurya,J. Rayimbaev,M. Altanji,I. Ibragimov,S. Muminov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We formulate and analyze a new class of electrically charged black hole (BH) solutions in Lorentz-violating gravity, where nonlinear ModMax electrodynamics is nonminimally coupled to a Kalb-Ramond (KR) two-form field. The spontaneous breaking of local Lorentz symmetry is triggered by a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the KR field, characterized by a small dimensionless parameter $\ell$. To incorporate both standard and phantom sectors, we introduce a discrete sign-flip parameter $\zeta = \pm1$, which flips the gauge-kinetic terms in the phantom ($\zeta = -1$) branch. Assuming a vanishing cosmological constant and a self-interacting potential with minimum $V' = 0$, we obtain exact analytical solutions for the metric function and electric potential. The resulting spacetime interpolates between Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and ModMax BHs, with curvature scalars showing deviations controlled by $(\ell, \gamma, \zeta)$. We study scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations using both frequency-domain (Pade-averaged WKB) and time-domain (Gundlach-Price-Pullin plus Prony) methods. We find that increasing either $\ell$ or the ModMax parameter $\gamma$ enhances the real and imaginary parts of QNMs, indicating higher oscillation frequencies and faster damping, especially in the phantom sector. The effective potentials deepen under phantom deformation, supporting more tightly bound modes. Furthermore, we analyze the greybody factors and compute the sparsity $\eta$ of Hawking radiation, which quantifies the nonthermal character of particle emission. We show that $\eta$ is significantly affected by $\ell$, decreasing with increasing Lorentz violation and asymptotically approaching a scaled version of the Schwarzschild value.",
New submissions,Quasinormal modes of noncommutative geometry-inspired dirty black holes,"Davide Batic,Denys Dutykh,Zeinabou Ahmed Babou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of noncommutative geometry-inspired dirty black holes, focusing on both non-extremal and extremal configurations. These gravitational objects, characterized by smeared energy distributions within a modified de Sitter-like equation of state, modify the classical Schwarzschild metric and regularize central singularities. We employ a spectral method based on Chebyshev polynomials to solve the eigenvalue problem for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations. Our results reveal new overdamped modes indicative of rapid decay without oscillation, particularly prominent in near-extremal and extremal regimes. Additionally, we establish that the QNMs converge to classical Schwarzschild values for large mass parameters, validating our method's robustness. Our findings highlight the impact of dirtiness and noncommutative effects on black hole QNM spectra, offering potential observational signatures for distinguishing these objects in gravitational-wave detections.",
New submissions,Short-Range Approximation to Casimir Wormholes Inspired by Scalar and Electric Fields,"Remo Garattini,Athanasios G. Tzikas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate a static traversable wormhole sustained by a combination of a minimally coupled scalar field and an electric field, with exotic matter sourced by Casimir energy. Considering two scenarios, where the Casimir plate separation is either radially variable or fixed, we derive analytical near-throat solutions for both massless and massive scalar fields. To ensure consistency of the field equations, a thermal tensor is also incorporated, consisting solely of pressure terms that vanish at the throat. In all cases, we obtain well-behaved wormhole manifolds with throat sizes that scale proportionally with the number of elementary charges the wormhole can support.",
New submissions,Modulation-assisted time-delay interferometric ranging for LISA,"Jean-Baptiste Bayle,Martin Staab,Samuel P. Francis,Emily Rose Rees,Robert Spero,Gerhard Heinzel",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA represents the next frontier in gravitationalwave GW astronomy targeting the detection of millihertz gravitational signals Central to LISAs operation is the nanosecondprecision estimation of the light travel times LTTs between its constituent spacecraft Precise LTT estimates are critical for suppressing dominant laser noise with timedelay interferometry TDI and ensuring the required sensitivity to GW signals The baseline method is to modulate a pseudorandom noise PRN code on the laser beams exchanged between the spacecraft Timedelay interferometric ranging TDIR was proposed as a simpler alternative LTT estimation method TDIR LTT estimates are chosen to minimize the TDI residual noise over the full LISA frequency band TDIR can be used in case of PRN failure or to calibrate the biases of the PRN method In this study we introduce modulationassisted TDIR MATDIR an enhanced variant of TDIR that significantly improves LTT estimation precision and resilience MATDIR achieves this by modulating the laser phase at specific frequencies close to 1Hz thereby artificially elevating the laser phase content relative to secondary unsuppressed noises This modulation strategy not only enhances the signaltonoise ratio for TDIR but also mitigates the impact of GW signals and instrumental artifacts enabling more reliable LTT estimates with reduced integration times We develop the theoretical framework of MATDIR incorporating the full constellation of three spacecraft laser locking and multiple Michelson TDI combinations Analytical predictions confirmed by numerical simulations indicate that MATDIR can achieve LTT estimates comparable to the 1mrms at fs 4 Hz of the PRNbased baseline method We therefore suggest that the possibility to modulate lasers is added to the laser system requirements of LISA,
New submissions,Fermion quasinormal modes on modified RN background,"Nikola Herceg,Nikola Konjik,A. Naveena Kumara,Andjelo Samsarov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Noncommutative (NC) geometry may open an alternative route to quantum gravity. We study the influence of the spacetime noncommutativity on the Dirac quasinormal modes in the modified Reissner-Nordström black hole spacetime. The framework for the latter study is provided by a certain effective model of gravity coupled to fermions which in itself encapsulates noncommutative deformation. This model describes a classical Dirac field coupled to a modified Reissner-Nordström geometry where the corresponding metric acquires an additional nonvanishing $r-\varphi $ component. As the earlier study shows, this model appears to be equivalent to a model of semiclassical NC gauge theory in which a NC gauge field is being coupled to a NC fermion field on the one side and the classical Reissner-Nordström background on the other. In comparison to the undeformed model where the Dirac field is coupled to the commutative Reissner-Nordström black hole, the numerical results show that the oscillation frequencies and magnitude of damping of the Dirac quasinormal modes change to an extent that cannot be neglected. In fact, the influence of spacetime noncommutativity is shown to produce features reminiscent of a Zeeman-like splitting in the effective potential and quasinormal-mode spectrum.",
New submissions,Dynamical theory for spherical black holes in modified gravity,"Asier Alonso-Bardaji,David Brizuela",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We provide a general algorithm to construct a Hamiltonian, such that its dynamical flow covariantly defines any given spherically symmetric and static metric. This Hamiltonian is defined as a linear combination of the standard (general relativistic) radial diffeomorphism constraint plus a Hamiltonian constraint that is appropriately deformed as compared to its corresponding form in general relativity though it does not include higher-derivative terms. Therefore, given a static model of spherical gravity, it is possible to obtain its Hamiltonian, and, thus, its canonical (second-order) equations of motion. A particularly relevant application of this construction is the study of regular black holes, where proposed geometries often lack an underlying dynamical theory. The present method provides such a theory. In particular, for a wide class of deformations of the Schwarzschild geometry, we explicitly obtain their corresponding Hamiltonian. This construction can be further used to covariantly couple matter. In this way, one can analyze the backreaction of matter fields on the geometry of interest, and, specifically, whether a particular black-hole model may emerge as the end state of a dynamical collapse.",
New submissions,Remnant properties of binary neutron star mergers undergoing prompt collapse,"Arnab Dhani,Alessandro Camilletti,David Radice,Rahul Kashyap,Bangalore Sathyaprakash,Domenico Logoteta,Albino Perego",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the properties of remnants formed in prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers. We consider non-spinning binaries over a range of total masses and mass ratios across a set of 22 equations of state, totaling 107 numerical relativity simulations. We report the final mass and spin of the systems (including the accretion disk and ejecta) to be constrained in a narrow range, regardless of the binary configuration and matter effects. This sets them apart from binary black-hole merger remnants. We assess the detectability of the postmerger signal in a future 40 km Cosmic Explorer observatory and find that the signal-to-noise ratio in the postmerger of an optimally located and oriented binary at a distance of 100 Mpc can range from ${<}1$ to 8, depending on the binary configuration and equation of state, with a majority of them greater than 4 in the set of simulations that we consider. We also consider the distinguishability between prompt-collapse binary neutron star and binary black hole mergers with the same masses and spins. We find that Cosmic Explorer will be able to distinguish such systems primarily via the measurement of tidal effects in the late inspiral. Neutron star binaries with \emph{reduced tidal deformability} $\tilde\Lambda$ as small as ${\sim}3.5$ can be identified up to a distance of 100 Mpc, while neutron star binaries with $\tilde\Lambda\sim22$ can be identified to distances greater than 250 Mpc. This is larger than the distance up to which the postmerger will be visible. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our findings for the equation of state of neutron stars from the gravitational-wave event GW230529.",
Cross submissions,Magnetic Flux Emergence in Binary Neutron Star Remnants,"Jacob Fields,David Radice,Peter Hammond",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Using high-resolution AthenaK simulations of a twisted toroidal flux tube, we study the flux emergence of magnetic structures in the shear layer of a hot massive neutron star typical of a binary neutron star remnant. High-resolution simulations demonstrate that magnetic buoyant instabilities allow for emergence only for extremely large magnetic fields significantly exceeding $10^{17}~\mathrm{G}$, and more typical fields around $10^{16}~\mathrm{G}$ are instead dominated by hydrodynamic effects. Because merger remnants tend to be stable against hydrodynamic convection, our work places strong limitations on the mechanisms by which massive binary neutron star remnants can produce the magnetically-driven outflows needed to power jets.",
Cross submissions,A New Framework to Detect Multi-Messenger Signals from Bright Sporadic Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background,"Hardik Jitendra Kuralkar,Mohit Raj Sah,Suvodip Mukherjee",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The temporal dependence of the astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background (SGWB) in the hecto-hertz band brings a unique avenue to identify multi-messenger signals to these sources by using coincident detection in both GW and multi-band EM signals. We developed a new analysis pipeline, \textit{Multi-messenger Cross-Correlation} (MC$^2$) that can search for EM counterparts to the SGWB signal originating from both modeled and unmodeled sources by harnessing the nearly full-sky gamma-ray sky map. We provide an observation strategy that can be followed by current and future missions to discover EM counterparts to the weak GW signal hidden in the SGWB. We demonstrate the ability of this technique to drastically reduce the false alarm rates when involving EM multi-band analysis. This formalism aims towards advancing the multi-messenger observation frontier and improving our understanding of the population of bright SGWB sources present in the high-redshift universe and can also be applied to other messengers such as neutrinos in the future.",
Cross submissions,Non-linear Dynamics and Primordial Black Hole Formation During Kination,"Cheng Cheng,Panagiotis Giannadakis,Lucien Heurtier,Eugene A. Lim",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.",
