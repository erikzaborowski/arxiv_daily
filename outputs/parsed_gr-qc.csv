New submissions,Physical Existence of Relativistic Stellar Models within the context of Anisotropic Matter Distribution,"M. Sharif,Tayyab Naseer,Hira Shadab",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Two distinct non-singular interior models that describe anisotropic spherical configurations are presented in this work. We develop the Einstein field equations and the associated mass function in accordance with a static spherical spacetime. We then discuss certain requirements that must be satisfied for compact models to be physically validated. Two distinct limitations are taken into account to solve the field equations, including different forms of the radial geometric component and anisotropy, which ultimately leads to a couple of relativistic models. In both cases, solving the differential equations result in the appearance of integration constants. By equating the Schwarzschild exterior metric and spherical interior line element on the interface, these constants are explicitly obtained. The disappearance of the radial pressure on the hypersurface is also used in this context. We further use estimated radii and masses of six different stars to graphically visualize the physical properties of new solutions. Both of our models are deduced to be well-aligned with all physical requirements, indicating the superiority of the presence of anisotropy in compact stellar interiors over the perfect isotropic fluid content.",
New submissions,On defining astronomically meaningful Reference Frames in General Relativity,"L. Filipe O. Costa,Francisco Frutos-Alfaro,José Natário,Michael Soffel",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"In a recent paper we discussed when it is possible to define reference frames nonrotating with respect to distant inertial reference objects (extension of the IAU reference systems to exact general relativity), and how to construct them. We briefly review the construction, illustrating it with further examples, and caution against the recent misuse of zero angular momentum observers (ZAMOs).",
New submissions,Can Relativistic Effects explain Galactic Dynamics without Dark Matter?,"L. Filipe O. Costa,José Natário",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We show that, contrary to some recent claims, relativistic effects cannot mimic dark matter in the galactic rotation curves and gravitational lensing.",
New submissions,Asymptotically flat black holes with a singular Cauchy horizon and a spacelike singularity,Maxime Van de Moortel,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In our recent work [Van de Moortel, The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes], we analyzed the transition between null and spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric dynamical black holes and demonstrated that the spacelike portion is described by a Kasner metric with positive varying exponents that degenerate to $(1,0,0)$ near the null-spacelike transition. In the present paper, we provide examples of global spacetimes satisfying the assumptions of this previous result and apply its analysis to obtain a large class of asymptotically flat (spherically symmetric) black hole spacetimes that exhibit coexisting null and spacelike singularities. Our main results include:_The construction of one-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-scalar-field equations. The proof relies on a new spacelike-characteristic gluing method between any uncharged spherically symmetric solution and the event horizon of a charged dynamical black hole._The construction of a large class of two-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-(uncharged)-scalar-field equations.In both cases, we show that the terminal boundary in the black hole interior only has two distinct components: a weakly singular (null) Cauchy horizon $\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ where curvature blows up and a strong singularity $\mathcal{S}=\{r=0\}$.Our construction provides the first examples of black holes with coexisting null and spacelike singularities. These examples hold particular significance in the one-ended case as a model of gravitational collapse, where this phenomenon is conjecturally generic for the Einstein-scalar-field model, even beyond spherical symmetry.",
New submissions,Weakly turbulent saturation of the nonlinear scalar ergoregion instability,Nils Siemonsen,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We perform time-domain evolutions of the ergoregion instability on a horizonless spinning ultracompact spacetime in scalar theories with potential-type and derivative self-interactions mimicking the nonlinear structure of the Einstein equations. We find that the instability saturates by triggering a weakly turbulent direct cascade, which transfers energy from the most unstable and large-scale modes to small scales. The cascade's nonlinear timescales of each mode are orders of magnitude shorter than the corresponding linear e-folding times. Through this mechanism, the counter-rotating stable light ring is filled with a spectrum of higher-order azimuthal modes forming a ring-like shape. Thereby we demonstrate that turbulent processes are likely also important during the fully gravitational saturation of the instability, leaving imprints in the gravitational wave emission.",
New submissions,"Ergoregion instability in bosonic stars: scalar mode structure, universality, and weakly nonlinear effects",Nils Siemonsen,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Ultracompact spinning horizonless spacetimes with ergoregions are subject to the ergoregion instability. We systematically investigate the instability of a massless scalar field in a variety of rapidly spinning Proca stars and boson stars using WKB-, frequency-, and time-domain methods. We find universal features in the mode structure: the onset of the instability is signaled by a zero-mode, the mode frequencies and growth rates are related by a simple scaling relation in the small-frequency limit (as found for Kerr-like objects), the mode frequencies approach the orbital frequency of counter-rotating stably trapped null geodesics in the eikonal limit, and for each unstable azimuthal mode only a finite number of overtones and polar modes are exponentially growing. The e-folding times are as short as $\tau\sim 10^4 M$ (in terms of the spacetime's ADM mass $M$). Interestingly, we find a near universal relationship between the frequencies and growth rates across all bosonic stars and also compared with Kerr-like objects. Furthermore, we show that weakly nonlinear backreaction of the instability induces a shift in growth rates as well as emission of gravitational waves; we find evidence that these effects lead to an amplification of the unstable process. This suggests that strongly nonlinear interactions are important during the gravitational saturation of the instability.",
New submissions,Shadows and amplitude luminosity of an embedded rotating black hole,"Abraao J. S. Capistrano,Antonio C. Gutierrez-Pineres,Carlos H. Coimbra-Araujo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a rotating black hole embedded in a five-dimensional flat bulk by extending the Kerr metric through the Gurses-Gursey line element. Employing Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, we reinterpret the black hole as a charged-like object in five dimensions and analyze its horizon structure and shadow morphology. Our results reveal that the shadow is shaped by an axially symmetric gravitational field modulated by an extrinsic curvature term arising from the higher-dimensional embedding. Simulations demonstrate that the visibility amplitude and shadow profile of the Gurses-Gursey black hole align with Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87 in the Kerr limit, while also allowing measurable deviations that could be probed by future high-resolution experiments.",
New submissions,Mass-to-Horizon Relation and Entropy Beyond the Bekenstein-Hawking Limit,Hussain Gohar,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We introduce a generalized mass-horizon relation applicable to cosmological horizons. This formulation provides a unified framework for deriving a broad class of Bekenstein entropy extensions motivated by statistical mechanics, quantum gravity, and phenomenological considerations, through the application of the Clausius relation together with the Hawking temperature. We further introduce this notion as a foundational framework for constructing generalized entropy forms that remain consistent with thermodynamic laws and the holographic principle.",
New submissions,Gravitational Waves on Kerr Black Holes II: Metric Reconstruction with Cosmological Constant,"Roman Berens,Trevor Gravely,Alexandru Lupsasca",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this second paper of our series started with \cite{Berens2024}, we investigate linearized gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole in a non-asymptotically flat spacetime with (anti-)de Sitter boundary conditions. Here, we explicitly write down the metric components (in both ingoing and outgoing radiation gauge) of the perturbations that correspond to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. We provide formulas involving Hertz potentials (intermediate quantities with a holographic interpretation) as well as some that involve only the separated radial and angular modes. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies of black hole perturbation theory in the context of the holographic correspondence.",
New submissions,Spontaneous Emergence of Lorentzian Signature from Curvature-Minimizing Geometry,Miguel Bermudez,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"A simple covariant model is presented where the signature of the metric is a dynamical field. Degenerate minima of a curvature-minimizing potential correspond to Euclidean, Lorentzian or mixed phases of geometry. The Lorentzian phase emerges as the only stable configuration supporting causal propagation.",
New submissions,Effects of magnetic fields on spinning test particles orbiting Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes,"Yu-Kun Zhang,Shao-Wen Wei",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we study the kinematic effects of spinning test particles orbiting the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black hole. Employing with the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, we explore the dynamics of precessing orbits and distinct orbital types, including circular orbits and innermost stable circular orbits. Our results reveal the substantial impact of the magnetic field on the trajectories of spinning particles, particularly in regions characterized by significant radial distances. More importantly, our study shows that an augmented magnetic field necessitates an increased orbital angular momentum to uphold spinning particles within their characteristic orbits at equivalent radial distances. Our result contributes valuable insights to the understanding of the spinning celestial object motion around black holes endowed with magnetic fields.",
New submissions,Newly scalarization of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black hole,"Lina Zhang,De-Cheng Zou,Yun Soo Myung",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Th spontaneous scalarization of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black hole is performed in the EEH-scalar theory by introducing an exponential scalar coupling (with $\alpha$ coupling constant) to the Maxwellthis http URL, the EEH black hole as a blad black hole is described by mass $M$ and magnetic charge $q$ with an action parameter $\mu$. A choice of $\mu=0.3$ gurantees a single horizon with unrestricted magnetic charge $q$. The onset scalarization of this black hole appears for a positive coupling $\alpha$ with an unlimited magnetic charge $q$. However, there exists a difference between $q\le1$ and $q>1$ onset scalarizations. We notify the presence of infinite branches labeled by the number of $n=0,1,2,\cdots$ of scalarized charged black holes by taking into account the scalar seeds around the EEH black hole. We find that the $n=0$ fundamental branch of all scalarized black holes is stable against the radial perturbations, while the $n=1$ excited branch is unstable.",
New submissions,The influence of the mean anomaly on the dynamical quantities of binary black hole mergers in eccentric orbits,"Hao Wang,Bin Liu,Yuan-Chuan Zou,Qing-Wen Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"In studies of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in eccentric orbits, the mean anomaly, traditionally regarded as less significant than eccentricity, has been thought to encode only the orbital phase, leading to the assumption that it exerts minimal influence on the dynamics of eccentric mergers. In a previous investigation, we identified consistent oscillations in dynamical quantities peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in relation to the initial eccentricity $e_0$. These oscillations are associated with integer orbital cycles within a phenomenological framework. In this paper, we aim to explore the underlying physical nature of these oscillations through gravitational waveforms. Our examination of remnant mass and spin reveals that while the initial ADM mass $M_{\mathrm{ADM}}$ and orbital angular momentum $L_0$ exhibit gradual variations with $e_0$, the radiated energy $E_{\text{rad}}$ and angular momentum $L_{\text{rad}}$ display oscillatory patterns akin to those observed in $M_{\text{rem}}$ and $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$. By decomposing the waveforms into three distinct phases inspiral, late inspiral to merger, and ringdown, we demonstrate that these oscillations persist across all phases, suggesting a common origin. Through a comparative analysis of $E_{\text{rad}}$ and $L_{\text{rad}}$ derived from numerical relativity (NR), post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, and orbital-averaged PN fluxes during the inspiral phase, we identify the initial mean anomaly $l_0$ as the source of the observed oscillations. ...",
New submissions,Noncommutative Regge-Wheeler potential: some nonperturbative results,"Nikola Herceg,Tajron Jurić,A. Naveena Kumara,Andjelo Samsarov,Ivica Smolić",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the gravitational perturbation theory of black holes in noncommutative spacetimes with noncommutativity of the type $[t\stackrel{\star}{,} r] = i a \alpha A(r)$ and $[\varphi \stackrel{\star}{,} r] = i a \beta A(r)$ for arbitrary $A(r)$, which includes several Moyal-type spaces and also the $\kappa$-Minkowski space. The main result of this paper is an analytical expression for the effective potential of the axial perturbation modes, valid to all orders in the noncommutativity parameter. This is achieved by evaluating the $\star$-products using translations in the radial direction, i.e., Bopp shift. We comment on various regimes, such as Planck-scale black holes, where the noncommutativity length scale is of the same order of magnitude as the black hole horizon.",
New submissions,Spectrum of pure $R^2$ gravity: full Hamiltonian analysis,"Will Barker,Dražen Glavan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We perform a full Hamiltonian constraint analysis of pure Ricci-scalar-squared ($R^2$) gravity to clarify recent controversies regarding its particle spectrum. While it is well established that the full theory consistently propagates three degrees of freedom, we confirm that its linearised spectrum around Minkowski spacetime is empty. moreover, we show that this is not a feature unique to Minkowski spacetime, but a generic property of all traceless-Ricci spacetimes that have a vanishing Ricci scalar, such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The mechanism for this phenomenon is a change in the nature of the constraints upon linearisation: ten second-class constraints of the full theory become first-class, while the three momentum constraints degenerate into a single constraint. Furthermore, we show that higher order perturbation theory around these singular backgrounds reveals no degrees of freedom at any order. This is in conflict with the general analysis and points to the fact that such backgrounds are surfaces of strong coupling in field space, where the dynamics of perturbations becomes nonperturbative. We further show via a cosmological phase-space analysis that the evolving universe is able to penetrate through the singular $R=0$ surface.",
New submissions,"Primordial Black Holes, Charge, and Dark Matter: Rethinking Evaporation Limits","Sebastian Schuster(Stockholm University),Jessica Santiago(National Taiwan University),Justin Feng(CEICO Prague),Matt Visser(Victoria University of Wellington)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on (near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.",
New submissions,Scalar-tensor theories in the Lyra geometry: Invariance under local transformations of length units and the Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum,"E. C. Valadão,Felipe Sobrero,Santiago Esteban Perez Bergliaffa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"The Lyra geometry provides an interesting approach to develop purely geometrical scalar-tensor theories due to the natural presence of the Lyra scale function. This paper explores further the scale function source term to construct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of both Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It is shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry comprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of length units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally fixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in which the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity is obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same procedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from their Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the Mach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is controlled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known scalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular Lyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls the unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from the perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry makes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the same theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally. The Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring scalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein frame.",
New submissions,Effects of dark dipole radiation on eccentric supermassive black hole binary inspirals,"Mu-Chun Chen,Yan Cao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation, and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.",
Cross submissions,Large-scale peculiar velocities in the universe,"Christos G. Tsagas,Leandros Perivolaropoulos,Kerkyra Asvesta",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Observations have repeatedly confirmed the presence of large-scale peculiar motions in the universe, commonly referred to as ``bulk flows''. These are vast regions of the observable universe, typically spanning scales of several hundred Mpc, that move coherently with speeds of the order of several hundred km/sec. While there is a general consensus on the direction of these motions, discrepancies persist in their reported sizes and velocities, with some of them exceeding the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The observed large-scale peculiar-velocity fields are believed to have originated as weak peculiar-velocity perturbations soon after equipartition, which have subsequently grown by structure formation and by the increasing inhomogeneity of the post-recombination universe. However, the evolution and the implications of these bulk velocity fields remain poorly understood and they are still a matter of debate. For instance, it remains a challenge for the theoreticians to explain the high velocities measured by several bulk-flow surveys, like those recently reported using the CosmicFlows-4 data. Such extensive and fast velocity fields could have played a non-negligible role during structure formation and they might have also ``contaminated'' our observations. After all, in the history of astronomy, there are examples where relative-motion effects have led us to a serious misinterpretation of reality (shortened abstract due to length limits).",
Cross submissions,Localized states of BFSS super quantum mechanics,"Oscar J.C. Dias,Jorge E. Santos",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat),"We analyze the recently discovered localized and non-uniform phases of the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) matrix quantum mechanics. Building on [1], we provide first-principles derivations of their properties and extend the results with new analytic and numerical insights. We show that strongly coupled BFSS dynamics emerge from a specific Carrollian transformation of 11-dimensional supergravity, which we justify in detail. In this framework, the uniform BFSS phase corresponds to a black string in a $pp$-wave background. We demonstrate that this background is unstable to a Gregory-Laflamme instability and, for the first time, compute the associated growth rate. The instability gives rise to non-uniform and localized phases that dominate the microcanonical ensemble in certain low-energy regimes, with the localized phase also prevailing in the canonical ensemble at low temperatures. We identify the corresponding first- and second-order phase transitions and derive analytic formulas for the thermodynamics of the localized phase, accurate to better than $0.3\%$ against numerical results.",
Cross submissions,Heterotic Footprints in Classical Gravity: PM dynamics from On-Shell soft amplitudes at one loop,"Arpan Bhattacharyya,Saptaswa Ghosh,Ankit Mishra,Sounak Pal",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We study classical scattering of charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory. Working in the classical (Post-Minkowskian) regime, we extract the conservative two-body potential by expanding the one loop amplitudes in the soft regime. We show explicitly that, as in GR, the relevant soft amplitudes are infrared (IR) finite once the long-range interactions are consistently treated via Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the associated IR subtraction. The scattering angle is then obtained from the eikonal exponentiation of the soft amplitude. Our results track the separate roles of electromagnetic and dilatonic charges in both the conservative dynamics and the eikonal phase, and they reduce smoothly to the GR limit when the charges and dilaton coupling are switched off. Where applicable, we compare with existing results in the literature and find agreement. These findings provide amplitude-based benchmarks for compact-object dynamics in EMD and furnish building blocks for waveform modeling in beyond-GR scenarios.",
Cross submissions,On the consistent disformal couplings to fermions,"Guillem Domènech,Alexander Ganz,Apostolos Tsabodimos",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Disformal couplings to fermions lead to a unique derivative coupling to the axial fermionic current, which contains higher derivatives in general. We derive general conditions on consistent disformal couplings by requiring the absence of higher time derivatives, as they typically lead to ghost degrees of freedom. For a two-scalar field disformal transformation, we show that the consistent disformal coupling must have a degenerate field space metric. This allows us to explore consistent, new two-scalar field modified gravity models. We show that the transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action leads to two-field Horndeski or two-field DHOST theories. Our formalism also applies to disformal transformations with higher derivatives. We derive the consistent subclasses of disformal transformations that include second derivatives of a scalar field and first derivatives of a vector field that lead to generalized U-DHOST and degenerate beyond generalized Proca theories.",
Cross submissions,Apparent Lorentz violation from disformally coupled ultralight dark matter,"Guillem Domènech,Apostolos Tsabodimos,Nathaniel Sherrill,Alexander Ganz,Fiona Kirk",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the impact of general disformal metric transformations on fermions, which shift the gravitational metric by an additional rank-2 tensor. This tensor can in principle be constructed from scalar-field gradients, vector fields, or field-strength contractions. We show this transformation results in the conventional Dirac action being modified by additional kinetic and axial-current couplings that are quadratic in the shifted field. When the field sourcing the metric shift takes on a non-trivial background value, apparent Lorentz-violating effects can result, which we identify as terms in an effective field theory. Assuming the well-motivated cases of scalar and vector ultralight dark matter, we demonstrate that experimental tests of rotation and boost violation imply constraints on the additional kinetic coupling. Even under conservative assumptions, the constraints for vector ultralight dark matter are extremely stringent.",
Cross submissions,GPU-Accelerated X-ray Pulse Profile Modeling,"Tianzhe Zhou,Chun Huang",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"Pulse-profile modeling (PPM) of thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars enables simultaneous constraints on the mass $M$, radius $R$, and hence the equation of state of cold, dense matter. However, Bayesian PPM has faced a hard accuracy-speed bottleneck: current production resolutions used to keep inference tractable can under-resolve extreme hotspot geometries and bias the waveform computation, whereas the higher resolutions that remove this bias push forward models to minutes per evaluation, making inference impractical. We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public GPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to within $\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while collapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX 4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at resolutions and complexities previously out of reach. We further uncover a bias near the interpolation boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, demonstrate it with two diagnostic tests, and counter it with a mixed-order interpolator. Together, these advances enlarge the feasible hotspot model space and reduce key systematics in PPM, strengthening inferences for current and future X-ray missions.",
Cross submissions,The detection of Planck-scale physics facilitated by nonlinear quantum optics,"Wenlin Li,Chengsong Zhao,Najmeh Eshaqi-Sani,Zhiyu Jiang,Xingli Li",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A tenet of contemporary physics is that novel physics beyond the Standard Model lurks at a scale related to the Planck length. The development and validation of a unified framework that merges general relativity and quantum physics is contingent upon the observation of Planck-scale physics. Here, we present a fully quantum model for measuring the nonstationary dynamics of a ng-mass mechanical resonator, which will slightly deviate from the predictions of standard quantum mechanics induced by modified commutation relations associated with quantum gravity effects at low-energy scalar. The deformed commutator is quantified by the oscillation frequency deviation, which is amplified by the nonlinear mechanism of the detection field. The measurement resolution is optimized to a precision level that is $15$ orders of magnitude below the electroweak scale.",
Cross submissions,Work distribution of quantum fields in static curved spacetimes,"Rafael L. S. Costa,Marcos L. W. Basso,Jonas Maziero,Lucas C. Céleri",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the formulation of work distributions for quantum scalar fields in static curved spacetimes by extending the Ramsey interferometric protocol originally developed in previous works for flat spacetimes. The use of Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors provides a causally consistent framework to define and measure work statistics, avoiding the limitations of the two-time projective measurement scheme in relativistic quantum field theory. We derive a non-perturbative expression for the characteristic function of the quantum field and apply it to thermal Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states, showing that the resulting work distributions satisfy both the Crooks fluctuation theorem and the Jarzynski equality. Furthermore, we analyse the case of a pointlike detector, obtaining compact expressions for the first two moments of the work distribution, allowing us to recover the standard fluctuation-dissipation relation in the high-temperature limit. Our results demonstrate that fluctuation theorems hold for quantum fields interacting with Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors in static curved spacetimes.",
Cross submissions,Probing departures from $Λ$CDM by late-time datasets,"Himanshu Chaudhary,Vipin Kumar Sharma,Salvatore Capozziello,G. Mustafa",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Observational data play a pivotal role in identifying cosmological models that are both theoretically consistent and empirically viable. In this work, we investigate whether the standard $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits significant departure with current late time datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI DR2, and various Type Ia supernova compilations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, Union3). We analyze several dynamical dark energy models, including $\omega$CDM, o$\omega$CDM, $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE. While CC + DESI DR2 data show mild deviations from $\Lambda$CDM ($\lesssim 2\sigma$), adding supernova samples (DES-SN5Y or Union3) increases deviations, with BA, JBP, and Logarithmic models reaching $3-3.5\sigma$, and CC + DESI DR2 + DES-SN5Y producing the largest deviations. We find consistent evidence for $\omega_0 > -1$ and $\omega_a < 0$ in all dark energy models, indicating that the cosmological constant faces a potential crisis and that dynamical dark energy models could provide a possible solution, characterized by a Quintom-B type scenario. The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, successfully shaping our understanding of the Universe from its earliest epochs to the present day. However, in light of DESI DR2 and other recent measurements, emerging cracks in this paradigm suggest that a complete understanding of the cosmos may require moving beyond the cosmological constant and exploring new physics governing the dark sector.",
