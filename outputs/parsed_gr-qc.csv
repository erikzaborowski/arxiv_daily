New submissions,Few-grid-point simulations of Big Bang singularity in quantum cosmology,Miloslav Znojil,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the context of the current lack of compatibility of the classical and quantum approaches to gravity, exactly solvable elementary pseudo-Hermitian quantum models are analyzed supporting the acceptability of a point-like form of Big Bang. The purpose is served by a hypothetical (non-covariant) identification of the ``time of Big Bang'' with the Kato's exceptional-point parameter $t=0$. Consequences (including the ambiguity of the patterns of unfolding of the singularity after Big Bang) are studied in detail. In particular, singular values of the observables are shown useful in the analysis.",
New submissions,"Black holes in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled with Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics","Yizhi Liang,Jun Tao,Rui Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the scenario of black holes coupled with the Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electromagnetic field in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. The black hole solutions for electrically charged, magnetically charged and the dyonic case are separately analyzed, and we discuss the scalar curvature and the energy conditions of the black hole spacetime. In the magnetic charge solution, the $f(R,T)$ correction appears in the $1/r^6$ Euler-Heisenberg electromagnetic field correction term, while the electrically charged solution includes an $r^2$ term, with the curvature of the spacetime determined by the $f(R,T)$ coupling parameter. The dyonic solution is obtained through vacuum polarization quantum electrodynamics corrections, where electromagnetic duality is broken and the solution exists higher-order correction terms. The relationship between the event horizon and charge of dyonic extreme black holes is studied. Furthermore, we investigate the effective metric, photon trajectories, and innermost stable circular orbit under nonlinear electromagnetic effects, providing images of photon geodesic for varying electric and magnetic charge strengths and $f(R,T)$ coupling parameter.",
New submissions,"Gravitational waves from b-EMRIs: Doppler shift and beaming, resonant excitation, helicity oscillations and self-lensing","João S. Santos,Vitor Cardoso,José Natário,Maarten van de Meent",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph),"We study gravitational waves from a stellar-mass binary orbiting a spinning supermassive black hole, a system referred to as a binary extreme mass ratio inspiral (b-EMRI). We use Dixon's formalism to describe the stellar-mass binary as a particle with internal structure, and keep terms up to quadrupole order to capture the generation of gravitational waves by the inner motion of the stellar-mass binary. The problem of emission and propagation of waves is treated from first principles using black hole perturbation theory. In the gravitational waveform at future null infinity, we identify for the first time Doppler shifts and beaming due to the motion of the center of mass, as well as helicity breaking gravitational lensing, and resonances with ringdown modes of the supermassive black hole. We establish that previously proposed phenomenological models inadequately capture these effects.",
New submissions,Exact plane symmetric black bounce with a perfect-fluid exterior obeying a linear equation of state,"Hideki Maeda,Cristian Martinez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate an exact two-parameter family of plane symmetric solutions admitting a hypersurface-orthogonal Killing vector in general relativity with a perfect fluid obeying a linear equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ in $n(\ge 4)$ dimensions, obtained by Gamboa in 2012. The Gamboa solution is identical to the topological Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-(anti-)de~Sitter $\Lambda$-vacuum solution for $\chi=-1$ and admits a non-degenerate Killing horizon only for $\chi=-1$ and $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$. We identify all possible regular attachments of two Gamboa solutions for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$ at the Killing horizon without a lightlike thin shell, where $\chi$ may have different values on each side of the horizon. We also present the maximal extension of the static and asymptotically topological Schwarzschild-Tangherlini Gamboa solution, realized only for $\chi\in(-(n-3)/(3n-5),0)$, under the assumption that the value of $\chi$ is unchanged in the extended dynamical region beyond the horizon. The maximally extended spacetime describes either (i) a globally regular black bounce whose Killing horizon coincides with a bounce null hypersurface, or (ii) a black hole with a spacelike curvature singularity inside the horizon. The matter field inside the horizon is not a perfect fluid but an anisotropic fluid that can be interpreted as a spacelike (tachyonic) perfect fluid. A fine-tuning of the parameters is unnecessary for the black bounce but the null energy condition is violated everywhere except on the horizon. In the black-bounce (black-hole) case, the metric in the regular coordinate system is $C^\infty$ only for $\chi=-1/(1+2N)$ with odd (even) $N$ satisfying $N>(n-1)/(n-3)$, and if one of the parameters in the extended region is fine-tuned.",
New submissions,Regular Vaidya solutions of effective gravitational theories,"Valentin Boyanov,Raúl Carballo-Rubio",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We initiate the study of the dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity through exact solutions of the field equations of second-order effective gravitational theories defined solely in terms of the symmetries of the problem in 4 or more dimensions. We prove the existence of regular Vaidya solutions that represent the formation or change in mass of regular black holes (or black hole mimickers) due to the gravitational collapse or accretion of radiation, with the time-reverse of these processes being also included as solutions. Our treatment and results are remarkable in their simplicity and the possibilities they provide for novel theoretical applications and discoveries in the context of regular gravitational collapse. For instance, we illustrate how modifications of the gravitational dynamics can cure curvature singularities through what can be interpreted as an energy transfer between matter and gravitational degrees of freedom. As another application, we show how to incorporate spacetimes frequently used in the literature, designed geometrically to represent the formation and disappearance of regular black holes, as fully dynamical solutions within this formalism.",
New submissions,The Cosmological Constant from a Quantum Gravitational $θ$-Vacua and the Gravitational Hall Effect,"Stephon Alexander,Heliudson Bernardo,Aaron Hui",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We provide a new perspective on the cosmological constant by exploring the background-independent Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of general relativity. The Chern-Simons-Kodama state of quantum gravity, a generalization of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin states, has a striking structural similarity to the topological field theory of the quantum Hall effect. As a result, we study the gravitational topological $\theta$-sectors in analogy to Yang-Mills theory. We find that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is intimately linked to the $\theta$-parameter by $\theta=12\pi^2/(\Lambda \ell^2_{\rm Pl}) \mod 2\pi$ due to the fact that Chern-Simons-Kodama state must live in a particular $\theta$-sector. This result is shown in the canonical, non-perturbative formalism. Furthermore, we explain how the physics of the Hamiltonian constraint is analogous to the quantum Hall effect, with the cosmological constant playing the role of a quantum gravitational Hall resistivity. These relations suggest that $\Lambda$ is topologically protected against perturbative graviton loop corrections, analogous to the robustness of quantized Hall conductance against disorder in a metal.",
New submissions,Spherically Symmetric Potentials in Quadratic $f(R)$ Gravity,Roger Anderson Hurtado,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the gravitational potential arising from static, spherically symmetric sources in a modified gravity theory described by a quadratic $f(R)$ model. The linearized field equations lead to a fourth-order differential equation, whose solution includes Newtonian and Yukawa-like terms. Imposing regularity at the origin and asymptotic flatness fixes all integration constants, making the potential fully determined by the mass distribution. We analyze classical profiles such as Plummer, Hernquist, and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), along with some new analytic models. For each case, we derive explicit expressions for the modified potential and analyze its dependence on the $f(R)$ parameter $\alpha$. The solutions demonstrate that while $f(R)$ corrections generically introduce $r^{-1}$ divergences at finite $\alpha$, these are cancelled in the GR limit, that is, when the scalar field mass becomes infinite. The new profiles offer alternatives for modeling astrophysical systems, particularly in regimes where deviations from Newtonian gravity may play a role. These results may serve as a theoretical groundwork for future studies of modified gravity in astrophysical contexts.",
New submissions,Deriving Entangled Relativity,"Olivier Minazzoli(ARTEMIS),Maxime Wavasseur,Thomas Chehab(ARTEMIS)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Entangled Relativity is a non-linear reformulation of Einstein's theory that cannot be defined in the absence of matter fields. It recovers General Relativity in the weak matter density limit or whenever $\mathcal{L}_m = T$ on-shell, and it is also more parsimonious in terms of fundamental constants and units. In this paper, we show that Entangled Relativity can be derived from a general $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m)$ theory by imposing a single requirement: the theory must admit all solutions of General Relativity whenever $\mathcal{L}_m = T  \ne 0$ on-shell, though not necessarily only those solutions. An important consequence is that all vacuum solutions of General Relativity are limits of solutions of Entangled Relativity when the matter fields tend to zero. In addition, we introduce a broader class of theories featuring an intrinsic decoupling, which, however, do not generally admit the solutions of General Relativity.",
New submissions,"The New Black Hole Solution with Anisotropic Fluid in f(R,Lm, T) Gravity: Thermodynamics","Aniruddha Ghosh,Ujjal Debnath",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we derive a new class of analytic black hole solutions within the framework of f(R,Lm, T) gravity, where the black hole is surrounded by an anisotropic fluid acting as the matter source. We consider both linear and nonlinear forms of the function f(R,Lm, T), enabling a detailed exploration of how anisotropic pressures and different f(R,Lm, T) influence the spacetime structure. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the coupling parameters (\b{eta}1, \b{eta}2, \b{eta}3) under which the energy conditions are satisfied. Utilising these constraints, we then investigate the thermodynamic behaviour of the resulting black hole solutions in the presence of various matter fields, namely, dust, radiation, and a quintessence field, each characterised by a distinct equation-of-state parameter. An important outcome of this study is that the results obtained deviate from those predicted by standard General Relativity. It is also observed that these deviations depend explicitly on the interaction between the matter Lagrangian Lm and the trace T of the energy-momentum tensor.",
New submissions,Charged Scalar Field at Future Null Infinity via Nonlinear Hyperboloidal Evolution,"João D. Álvares,Alex Vaño-Vinũales",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Quasinormal modes and power-law late-time decay tails of a charged scalar field in a charged black hole background have been studied, but never in the fully non-linear regime, as far as we know. In this paper, we study the dependence of these properties on the charges of scalar field and black hole. For the quasinormal modes, a fit of the spherical fundamental mode is shown for the purely uncharged case and compared to the charged one. We also see for the first time the transition from gravitational decay to pure electromagnetic decay, and show disagreement with the oscillation frequency between real and imaginary parts of the scalar field prescribed in the literature. Full non-linear evolutions of hyperboloidal slices in spherical symmetry were used to obtain our results, allowing for the extraction of signals at future null infinity.",
New submissions,Estimating Hubble Constant with Gravitational Observations: A Concise Review,Rosa Poggiani,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Hubble constant is of paramount importance in astrophysics and cosmology. A large number of methods have been developed with different electromagnetic probes to estimate its value. The most recent results show a tension between values obtained from Cosmic Microwave Background observations and supernovae. The simultaneous detection of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from GW170817 provided a direct estimation of the Hubble constant that did not depend on the astronomical distance ladder. This concise review will present the methods to estimate the Hubble constant with the gravitational observations of compact binary mergers, discussing both bright and dark sirens and reporting the state of the art of the results.",
New submissions,Emergence of cosmic structure from Planckian discreteness,"Gabriel R. Bengochea,Gabriel Leon,Alejandro Perez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In the standard inflationary paradigm the inhomogeneities observed in the CMB arise from quantum fluctuations of an initially homogeneous and isotropic vacuum state. This picture suffers from two well-known weaknesses. First, it assumes that quantum field theory remains valid at trans-Planckian scales, without modifications from quantum gravity. Second, it necessitates a quantum-to-classical transition in which fluctuations of a homogeneous quantum state become the classical inhomogeneities seen in the CMB. Recently, an alternative paradigm has been proposed in which such inhomogeneities are present from the very beginning, emerging from the assumed discreteness of spacetime at the Planck scale predicted by certain approaches to quantum gravity. Within this framework, scale-invariant scalar perturbations are generated naturally, without relying on trans-Planckian assumptions or invoking a quantum-to-classical transition. Specifically, inhomogeneities in the quantum state at the Planck scale propagate into semiclassical inhomogeneities on CMB scales. Here, we extend the aforementioned proposal to the most realistic case of a quasi-de Sitter expansion; in particular, we compute the scalar perturbation spectrum as a function of the slow-roll parameters, systematically encoded through the Hubble flow functions.",
New submissions,Periodic equatorial orbits in a black bounce scenario,"Anderson Bragado,Gonzalo J. Olmo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study equatorial closed orbits in a popular black bounce model to see if the internal structure of these objects could lead to peculiar observable features. Paralleling the analysis of the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, we show that in the black bounce case each orbit can also be associated with a triplet of integers which can then be used to construct a rational number characterizing each periodic orbit. When the black bounce solution represents a traversable wormhole, we show that the previous classification scheme is still applicable with minor adaptations. We confirm in this way that this established framework enables a complete description of the equatorial dynamics across a spectrum of cases, from regular black holes to wormholes. Varying the black bounce parameter $r_{min}$, we compare the trajectories in the Simpson-Visser model with those in the Schwarzschild metric (and the rotating case with Kerr). We find that in some cases even small increments in $r_{min}$ can lead to significant changes in the orbits.",
Cross submissions,Bayesian reconstruction of primordial perturbations from induced gravitational waves,"Aya Ghaleb,Ameek Malhotra,Gianmassimo Tasinato,Ivonne Zavala",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The formation of primordial black holes or other dark matter relics from amplified density fluctuations in the early universe may also generate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW), carrying vital information about the primordial power spectrum and the early expansion history of our universe. We present a Bayesian approach aimed at reconstructing both the shape of the scalar power spectrum and the universe's equation of state from GW observations, using interpolating splines to flexibly capture features in the GW data. The optimal number of spline nodes is chosen via Bayesian evidence, aiming at balancing complexity of the model and the fidelity of the reconstruction. We test our method using both representative mock data and recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements, demonstrating that it can accurately reconstruct the curvature power spectrum as well as the underlying equation of state, if different from radiation.",
Cross submissions,Micro Black Hole Dark Matter,"Manuel Ettengruber,Florian Kuhnel",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The influence of a possible low gravity scale, concretely through the presence of extra dimensions or additional species, on radiation properties of micro black holes is investigated. In particular, the suppression of evaporation through the so-called memory-burden effect is shown to be stronger, occurs earlier and with sharper transition compared to the canonical Planck-scale regime. It is furthermore shown how this affects the possibility of light primordial black hole dark matter, constraints on which may weaken substantially and allow them to be as light as $10^{-5}\,M_{\rm P}$, thereby lying in the particle regime.",
Cross submissions,"Can weak-gravity, causality-violation arguments constrain modified gravity?","Stephon Alexander,Heliudson Bernardo,Nicolás Yunes",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate limitations of causality arguments from flat-spacetime amplitudes, based on the eikonal limit of gravitational scattering, to place constraints on modified gravity. We show that causality constraints are only valid in the weak-gravity regime even for transplanckian scattering, and that such constraints are much less stringent than astrophysical ones, obtained for example from gravitational waves emitted in black hole coalescence. Special attention is given to the weakness of causality constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, but our results apply to other modified gravity theories as well. In the context of that theory, we also discuss how to obtain a time-delay formula from black hole, neutron stars, and shockwave solutions. For scattering with compact objects, we explicitly show that time delays are greatly suppressed by the ratio of the object's mass to the impact parameter, so time advances only occur greatly outside the cut off of the theory. For the shockwave solution, we find that the time delay is always positive within the regime of validity of the solution. We also comment on the impact of graviton nonlinearities for time-delay calculations in the nonlinear, strong gravity regime. We conclude that amplitude-based causality constraints on modified gravity are typically not stringent relative to other experimental and observational bounds.",
Cross submissions,Revealing Limitation in the Standard Cosmological Model: A Redshift-Dependent Hubble Constant from Fast Radio Bursts,"Surajit Kalita(Warsaw),Akhil Uniyal(TDLI),Tomasz Bulik(Warsaw),Yosuke Mizuno(TDLI)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$, which contradicts the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.",
Cross submissions,Extended datasamples under the lens of Brane World Theory,"Kyra Jacobo,Dorian Araya",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work revises the Brane World Theory known as Randall-Sundrum with the modification of an exponential, redshift-dependent brane tension. This model is studied in a scenario assuming no dark energy, with the aim of determining whether it can reproduce the universe's acceleration on its own, without the addition of a dark energy fluid. Bayesian statistical analysis is performed in order to constrain the free parameters of each scenario using SLS, SNIa, OHD, and BAO data samples, the last two considering newly added data points. Both Planck and Riess priors for h are used and compared. In both cases, we are able to reproduce the late-time accelerated expansion in agreement with observational data. Interesting consistencies at the transition redshift zt with LCDM are found, suggesting that this might be a suitable model for studying the evolution of the universe up to the present date. However, some pathologies are detected in this model, namely a ""Big Rip"" divergence of H(z) at z = 1, as well as a strong dependence between the functional form of the brane tension and the future evolution of the universe.",
Cross submissions,Detectability of post-Newtonian classical and quantum gravity via quantum clock interferometry,Eyuri Wakakuwa,Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry configuration designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could mediate entanglement between quantum systems. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Assuming the validity of the quantum equivalence principle, this approach may provide insights not only into the quantum nature of gravity but also into whether spacetime itself exhibits quantum properties. However, our analysis reveals that, within realistic experimental parameters, the expected effects are too small to be detected. We discuss possible interpretations of this undetectability, and its implications for tests of quantum gravity.",
Cross submissions,Quantum-corrected black hole thermodynamics from the gravitational path integral,"Yu-Qi Liu,Hao-Wei Yu,Peng Cheng",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Exploring quantum effects from black hole thermodynamics has always been a pivotal topic. In recent years, the free energy landscape and ensemble-averaged theory based on the Euclidean path integral approach have provided further understanding of the statistical aspects of the black hole system. We investigate the quantum-corrected thermodynamics of the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole by including off-shell geometries in the path integral. We obtain a one-loop effective action by considering the subleading-order terms in the ensemble-averaged theory, and verify that the effective thermodynamic quantities consistent with the effective action define a valid thermodynamics. Furthermore, the phase diagram was modified by the off-shell effects, resulting in a more abundant phase structure. We discover that the traditional black hole thermodynamics can be recovered in the semi-classical limit. The region of first-order phase transitions shrinks and zero-order phase transitions emerge when off-shell effects are included. The results provide new perspectives for understanding the quantum corrections in black hole thermodynamics.",
Cross submissions,Classical-quantum systems breaking conservation laws,"Masahiro Hotta,Sebastian Murk,Daniel R. Terno",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to features that challenge conventional physical intuition, such as the breakdown of conservation laws. To illustrate this issue, we consider a qubit interacting with a classical particle and demonstrate that the corresponding hybrid system violates angular momentum conservation despite the rotational symmetry of the underlying equations of motion.",
Cross submissions,What new physics can we extract from inflation using the ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 Observations?,"Sayantan Choudhury,Bauyrzhan Gulnur,Swapnil Kumar Singh,Koblandy Yerzanov",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.",
Cross submissions,Null infinity as an inverted extremal horizon: Matching an infinite set of conserved quantities for gravitational perturbations,"Shreyansh Agrawal,Panagiotis Charalambous,Laura Donnay",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Every spacetime that is asymptotically flat near null infinity can be conformally mapped via a spatial inversion onto the geometry around an extremal, non-rotating and non-expanding horizon. We set up a dictionary for this geometric duality, connecting the geometry and physics near null infinity to those near the dual horizon. We then study its physical implications for conserved quantities for extremal black holes, extending previously known results to the case of gravitational perturbations. In particular, we derive a tower of near-horizon gravitational charges that are exactly conserved and show their one-to-one matching with Newman-Penrose conserved quantities associated with gravitational perturbations of the extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole geometry. We furthermore demonstrate the physical relevance of spatial inversions for extremal Kerr-Newman black holes, even if the latter are notoriously not conformally isometric under such inversions.",
Cross submissions,Searching for Kerr in string amplitudes,"Francesco Alessio,Paolo Di Vecchia,Maurizio Firrotta,Paolo Pichini",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We continue the approach of [1] to attempt to reproduce the classical electromagnetic current of the $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$ solution from the infinite-spin limit of a three-point amplitude with two higher-spin string states and a massless vector. We review the infinite-spin limit of three-point amplitudes along the leading Regge trajectory, which differ from $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$, and we provide evidence that any sub-leading trajectory parallel to the leading one give the same result. We extend the above investigation to the simplest sub-leading trajectory not parallel to the leading one, containing physical states with the first two harmonics. We compute all three-point amplitudes involving two such states and a massless vector, using both covariant and DDF formalism, and we extract the associated classical infinite-spin limit. Inspired by the leading Regge case, where this limit reproduces the classical electromagnetic current sourced by a rigid rotating string, we derive new classical string solutions containing the first two harmonics and compare the currents they source to the infinite-spin amplitude of the two-harmonic state. We do not see a matching between the two approaches, and we find that the classical behaviour is instead reproduced by the amplitude involving coherent string states. We conclude this paper by discussing common patterns between the different amplitudes we considered, and we conjecture how they can be generalised to reproduce $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$.",
Cross submissions,On the generalized Komar charge of Kaluza-Klein theories and higher-form symmetries,"G. Barbagallo,J.L.V. Cerdeira,C. Gómez-Fayrén,P. Meessen,T. Ortín",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The generalized Komar $(d-2)$-form charge can be modified by the addition of any other on-shell closed (conserved) $(d-2)$-form charge. We show that, with Kaluza--Klein boundary conditions, one has to add a charge related to the higher-form symmetry identified in Ref.~\cite{Gomez-Fayren:2024cpl} to the naive Komar charge of pure 5-dimensional gravity to obtain a conserved charge charge whose integral at spatial infinity gives the mass. The new term also contains the contribution of the Kaluza--Klein monopole charge leading to electric-magnetic duality invariance.",
