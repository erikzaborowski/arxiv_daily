New submissions,"Compact stars with gravitational wave echoes in $f(R,L_{m},T)$ gravitational theory","Meghanil Sinha,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This work explores the gravitational wave echoes (GWEs) from the compact stellar configurations in the backdrop of $f(R,L_{m},T)$ gravity within static and spherically symmetric framework. Our study has utilized the MIT Bag model and color-favour-locked (CFL) phase equations of state (EoS) for matter description. Mass-radius profiles were determined by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equations. Model parameter variations were used to assess the configuration stability here. TOV solutions helped to evaluate compactness. Our results indicate that MIT bag model and CFL EoS in $f(R,L_{m},T)$ modified gravitational theory are capable of producing GWEs. The calculated wave frequencies lie within the range of $ 7.5-11 $ kHz range. We have also demonstrated that how different gravitational theory parametrization within $f(R,L_{m},T)$ theory affect our star structure and echo frequency characteristics. Surface redshift and adiabatic index analysis confirm the stability of our stellar model here.",
New submissions,"Constraining $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity with redshift-dependent pressure: Insights from observational probes","Amit Samaddar,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore the late time cosmological dynamics of the Universe within the framework of $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity by considering the specific form $f(Q, \mathcal{L}_m)=-Q+2\mathcal{L}_m+\gamma$. To describe the cosmic pressure evolution, a redshift dependent parametrization of $p(z)=\alpha+\frac{\beta z}{1+z}$ is introduced. MCMC analysis is performed using a combined datasets from Hubble ($46$ points), BAO ($15$ points including DESI DR2) and Pantheon$+$ ($1701$ SNe Ia), the model parameters are constrained as $H_{0}=67.9476^{+0.7534}_{-0.7523}$ (km/s/Mpc), $\alpha=-0.0002^{+0.0211}_{-0.0208}$, $\beta=-0.0001^{+0.0410}_{-0.0404}$ and $\gamma=0.0002^{+0.0599}_{-0.0602}$. The model predicts a transition from deceleration to acceleration at $z_{tr} \approx 0.493$ with present values $q_{0}=-0.255$ and $\omega_{0}=-0.9001$. The evolution of energy density and pressure aligns with observational expectations. An analysis of energy conditions shows that NEC and DEC are satisfied, while SEC is violated, consistent with late time acceleration. Moreover, the slow roll parameters $\epsilon_{1}$ and $\epsilon_{2}$ confirm a smooth inflationary regime. These results demonstrate the capability of the model to unify early Universe inflation with the current phase of cosmic acceleration.",
New submissions,Quintessence-Chameleon transitions in anisotropic Kiselev model of neutron stars,"M. V. Pradosh Keshav,V. Jithesh,Kenath Arun(Christ University, Bangalore)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a chameleon scalar field dynamically interacting with a Kiselev-type metric, where the static anisotropic fluid part of the metric is replaced by a density-dependent scalar field non-minimally coupled to curvature. This construction enables a transition from screened behavior in high-density regions-where the scalar acquires an effective mass m_\phi\propto\rho^1/2-to unscreened quintessence dynamics at large scales, characterized by a critical screening radius r_\rm crit\propto m_\phi^-1. By solving the modified TOV equations under spherical symmetry, we show that radial scalar gradients \partial_r\phi induce pressure anisotropies \Delta p\propto r^-1 in neutron star envelopes, while deviations from general relativity are suppressed deep in the core r<r_\rm crit\sim 0.03\,\mathrm{km} without destabilizing it. We further demonstrate that increasing the scalar coupling \beta enhances scalar energy density, which counteracts anisotropic pressure support and slightly reduces the maximum mass. The resulting (stable) configurations yield maximum mass M_max\approx 1.75\pm0.280\,M_\odot and radii R\approx11.35\pm1.11\,\mathrm{km}, consistent with conservative upper and lower bounds from multimessenger observations. Scalar contributions induce a modest suppression in the dimensionless tidal deformability \Lambda_\rm ST\Lambda_\rm GR\sim0.137 at 1.4\,M_\odot i.e, 86% suppression compared to typical GR star, falling well within the LIGO/Virgo range 70\lesssim\Lambda_1.4\lesssim 580. These results demonstrate that environmentally screened scalar fields can dynamically generate anisotropies and modify neutron star structure without violating current astrophysical bounds. In particular, percent-level deviations in compactness and tidal response provide falsifiable signatures of short-range scalar forces, offering a novel target for next-generation GW and multimessenger surveys.",
New submissions,Four-scalar model and spherically symmetric solution in $f({\cal T})$ theory,"G.G.L. Nashed,A. Eid",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we investigate the construction of spherically symmetric solutions within the framework of modified teleparallel gravity, focusing in particular on $f({\cal T})$ theory, where ${\cal T}$ represents the torsion scalar. Conventional mimetic gravity and its extension with two scalar fields are unable to reproduce general spherically symmetric geometries in $f({\cal T})$ gravity, since consistency requires either a constant torsion scalar or a linear form of $f({\cal T})$, which corresponds to the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR). To overcome this restriction, we introduce a four-scalar field formulation that generalizes the two-scalar model and enables the realization of arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetimes. We further demonstrate that the model avoids ghost degrees of freedom by imposing appropriate constraints through Lagrange multipliers. As an application of the formalism, we examine a specific spherically symmetric metric and determine the corresponding four scalar fields, analyzing their properties. In the presence of a quadratic extension of the action, ${\cal T} + \tfrac{\alpha}{2}{\cal T}^2$, our approach successfully reconstructs physically viable solutions free from ghost instabilities. These findings highlight the potential of scalar-field-based constructions for generating consistent spacetime geometries in modified gravity theories, thereby extending beyond the standard formulations.",
New submissions,Accretion of a Vlasov gas by a Kerr black hole,"Patryk Mach,Mehrab Momennia,Olivier Sarbach",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We investigate the accretion of a collisionless, relativistic kinetic gas by a rotating Kerr black hole, assuming that at infinity the state of the gas is described by a distribution function depending only on the energy of the particles. Neglecting the self-gravity of the gas, we show that relevant physical observables, including the particle current density and the accretion rates associated with the mass, the energy, and the angular momentum, can be expressed in the form of closed integrals that can be evaluated numerically or approximated analytically in the slow-rotation limit. The accretion rates are computed in this manner for both monoenergetic particles and the Maxwell-JÃ¼ttner distribution and compared with the corresponding results in the non-rotating case. Whereas it is shown that the angular momentum accretion rate vanishes exactly, it is found that the rotation of the black hole has a small but non-vanishing effect on the mass and the energy accretion rates, which is remarkably well described by an analytic calculation in the slow-rotation approximation to quadratic order in the rotation parameter. The effects of rotation on the morphology of the accretion flow are also analyzed.",
New submissions,Post-Newtonian expansion of scale-dependent gravity,"Nicolas R. Bertini,Marcos H. Novaes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Scale-dependent gravity is an extension of general relativity in which the Newton and cosmological constants may vary slightly with the energy scale due to remnant low-energy quantum effects. A fundamental feature of this approach is the scale-setting procedure. In a previous work by one of the authors, a covariant expression for the scale, consistent with conservation laws, was established. Here, we apply the full Will-Nordtvedt version of the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism to this framework, assuming that the constants can be expressed as a power series in the scale. We find that a new potential arises at the first post-Newtonian order, which is absent from the standard PPN formalism. This potential modifies the definitions of pressure and internal energy but does not affect center-of-mass orbits and is, therefore, not constrained by Solar System tests.",
New submissions,On the Kaluza-Klein geometric theory in affine spaces,"Oscar Castillo-Felisola,Aureliano Skirzewski,Jefferson Vaca-Santana",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In this work, we develop a generalization of Kaluza-Klein theory by considering a purely affine framework, without assuming a prior metric structure. We formulate the dimensional reduction using the geometry of principal fiber bundles and the Ehresmann connection, introducing adapted bases that allow an explicit decomposition of tensors, vectors, and connections. This formalism provides a natural geometric definition of the electromagnetic field as the difference between the horizontal space and the space generated by the observer's frame. We demonstrate that the presence of a nontrivial electromagnetic field requires the non-integrability of the horizontal distribution, and we derive a complete ansatz for decomposing the affine connection into fields defined on the reduced space. Under assumptions such as vanishing torsion, autoparallel fibers, and suitable normalization conditions, we show that the reduced theory corresponds to the Einstein-Maxwell system for purely radiative electromagnetic fields. Furthermore, we propose an interpretation where the metric emerges dynamically from the affine structure through the dynamics of the electromagnetic field.",
New submissions,A new class of rotating charged black holes with non-aligned electromagnetic field,"Hryhorii Ovcharenko,JiÅÃ­ PodolskÃ½",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a large family of twisting and expanding solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations of algebraic type D, for which the two double principal null directions (PNDs) of the Weyl tensor are not aligned with the null eigendirections of the Faraday tensor. In addition to systematically deriving this new class, we present its various metric forms and convenient parameterizations. We show that in Boyer-Lindquist-type coordinates these solutions depend on 7 parameters, namely the Kerr and NUT (Newman-Unti-Tamburino) twist parameters $a$ and $l$, mass parameter $m$, acceleration $\alpha$, strength of the Maxwell field $|c|$, and angular parameters $\beta, \gamma$ that represent two duality rotations of the Faraday tensor, which include the rotation between the electric and magnetic charges generating the aligned part of the Maxwell field. This coordinate parameterization, analogous to the Griffiths-PodolskÃ½ form of the PlebaÅski-DemiaÅski solutions, allows us to perform various limits, explicitly identify the subcases, and determine the physical interpretation of the new class. Interestingly, by considering the limit with no acceleration ($\alpha\to 0$), one obtains either the famous Kerr-Newman-NUT black holes (if the parameter $|c|$ remains constant) or the novel Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes, announced recently in our workarXiv:2507.05199(if $|c|\rightarrow \infty$ while $\alpha |c|=\mathrm{const.}$). We may thus conclude that this new class of spacetimes represents twisting charged accelerating black holes, immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field. In the non-twisting subcase, we obtain the previously known solutions of Alexeev-Garcia and Van den Bergh-Carminati.",
New submissions,Search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes with an effective-one-body template,"Yi-Fan Wang,Alexander H. Nitz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"As gravitational wave astronomy has entered an era of routine detections, it becomes increasingly important to precisely measure the physical parameters of individual events and infer population properties. Eccentricity is a key observable, suggesting that binaries form in a dense stellar environment through dynamical encounters. This work performs the first matched-filtering search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes (BBHs) covering the mass range $[5, 200]~M_\odot$ and eccentricity at 20 Hz up to 0.5 with a newly developed effective-one-body waveform model. Throughout the third observation run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, we identify 28 BBH events with a false alarm rate below once per 100 yr; all of which were previously reported in the GWTC-3 and 4-OGC catalogs. Additional candidates with false alarm rates between once per 1 and 100 yr are also reported. We perform an injection campaign to characterize the sensitive volume time of our search pipeline. Assuming that none of the eccentric BBH events were missed by previous searches, our results provide constraints on the event rate of eccentric BBHs in the mass range [5, 30] $M_\odot$. For a 30-30 $M_\odot$ BBH with eccentricity 0.5, the event rate is limited to less than 0.06 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$; this marks an order of magnitude improvement for sensitive volume compared with the previous search with a minimally modeled algorithm without using templates.",
New submissions,Black holes and wormholes in sourceless three-dimensional conformal Killing gravity,"Gerard Clement,Khireddine Nouicer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We derive all the sourceless solutions of three-dimensional conformal Killing gravity with two Killing vectors. Along with singular solutions and BTZ black holes, the stationary solutions include regular warped AdS3 black holes and wormholes.",
New submissions,Nonlinear electrodynamic black hole's impact on the gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits,"Mirzabek Alloqulov,Sanjar Shaymatov,Bobomurat Ahmedov,Tao Zhu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior around a magnetically charged black hole (MCBH) within the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). We examine how the NED charge parameter influences orbital dynamics by modifying the background spacetime geometry, thereby affecting the energy and angular momentum of particles. In particular, we calculate the radii of the marginally bound orbits (MBOs) and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs), demonstrating that the NED charge parameter reduces both radii. This provides valuable insight into the role of the charge parameter in shaping orbital behavior and altering spacetime geometry. We model the complex motion of a stellar-mass object, as a timelike particle, inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the MCBH background, with its trajectory described using periodic geodesic orbits. Based on this analysis of such periodic orbits, we further analyze the gravitational waveforms generated by extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which the SMBH's spacetime dominates the dynamics of the stellar-mass object. By combining particle trajectory analysis with waveform modeling in a semi-analytical, we show that the charge parameter arising from NED significantly alters the zoom-whirl orbital dynamics and induces notable changes in the waveform structure. These results illustrate that future gravitational wave (GW) observations may constrain the properties of MCBHs, thereby deepening our understanding of the gravitational imprint of nonlinear electrodynamics.",
New submissions,A universal relation among Euclidean integrals for black holes in higher-derivative gravity theories,"Yong Xiao,Qiang Wang,Aonan Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we establish a universal equality governing Euclidean integrals of gravitational actions in higher-derivative theories. This relation is shown to hold universally for asymptotically flat black holes in pure gravity, and is generalized to asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes through appropriate regularization. We further examine its validity in systems with matter-gravity coupling, identifying that violations occur only when matter fields exhibit pathological behaviors: divergence at the horizon or non-decaying profiles at infinity. These findings reveal fundamental constraints on gravitational thermodynamics and provide diagnostic tools for identifying ill-behaved matter configurations.",
New submissions,Non-stationary wormholes with the presence of scalar fields and modified gravity,"G.Alencar,R. DÃ¡rlla,Shin'ichi Nojiri,Sergei D. Odintsov,Diego SÃ¡ez-ChillÃ³n GÃ³mez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Some novel regular spacetimes are considered that show a non-stationary wormhole structure. A Simpson-Visser-like procedure is applied to reconstruct these regular spacetimes, free of time-like and space-like singularities. Such a procedure is also applied to describe a regular cosmological expansion, where the universe reaches a minimum scale and then rebounds. This type of regular spacetime is achieved by considering some scalar fields as sources, with the appropriate kinetic term and scalar potential. We show that all these sources turn out to be ghosts due to the wrong sign of the kinetic term. These ghosts can, however, be eliminated by constraints. Nevertheless, the same procedure is also explored in the framework of modified gravities, particularly within the so-called f(R) gravity, where a new wormhole spacetime is also obtained that does not require a ghost scalar field.",
New submissions,Flavour interferometry in Reissner-Nordstrom background,"Jean Alexandre,Emilio Meryn",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We derive the phase acquired by a neutral scalar particle propagating along Reissner-Nordstrom geodesics. Considering two flavours propagating on different trajectories which intersect, we plot the interference pattern induced by gravitational lensing from the charged compact object. Although the effect of the charge is subdominant in the metric, it proves to be significant in the phase, and shifts the interference pattern, compared to the Schwarzschild case. This pattern is characterised by two oscillation lengths which, if known, would allow the determination of both eigen masses independently.",
Cross submissions,Thermal $n$-Point Conformal Blocks in Four Dimensions from Oscillator Representations,"Martin Ammon,Jakob Hollweck,Tobias HÃ¶ssel,Katharina WÃ¶lfl",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We define and compute the four-dimensional thermal $n$-point conformal block in the projection channel using oscillator representations on $\mathbb{S}^1_\beta \times \mathbb{S}^3$. This is done by evaluating a class of integrals over the homogeneous space $\mathbb{D}_4$ of the four-dimensional conformal group. We restrict ourselves to scalar external operators and scalar exchange. In the low-temperature limit, our result reduces correctly to the vacuum $(n+2)$-point block in the comb channel. The corresponding expressions can be written as a series of terminating hypergeometric functions or equivalently, a series of weighted SU(2) spin-networks. Alternatively, functions adapted to the SU(2,2) representation are introduced and some properties are discussed.",
Cross submissions,Unified understanding of AlfvÃ©nic superradiance and the Blandford-Znajek process in a force-free black hole magnetosphere,"Sousuke Noda,Masaaki Takahashi",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the extraction of energy from a Kerr black hole via AlfvÃ©n waves (i.e., AlfvÃ©nic superradiance) in a force-free magnetosphere, in which the plasma inertia effects are ignored. We analyze the Poynting flux generated by AlfvÃ©n waves that propagate toward the event horizon across the inner light surface, the causal boundary for the waves. We find the relationship between the energy flux associated with AlfvÃ©n waves and that of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process. That is, both mechanisms can be described within a unified formulation of the Poynting flux, where the BZ process can be regarded as the long wavelength limit of the AlfvÃ©nic superradiance, and depending on the wave's frequency, AlfvÃ©n waves enhance or suppress the Poynting flux in the BZ process. This unified framework for the BZ process and the AlfvÃ©nic superradiance would offer a valuable perspective for understanding the energy sources of high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such as relativistic jets.",
Cross submissions,Scalar and spinor fields in gravitating cosmic string spacetimes,"Marcos Silva,Azadeh Mohammadi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We study the scattering behavior of scalar and spinor fields in the background of a gravitating cosmic string spacetime. The model explored here for the background vortex is non-abelian, becoming abelian in an appropriate limiting case. We adopted the formalism we developed in \cite{silva2021scattering}, modifying the standard partial wave approach. We apply the method for a scalar and also a fermion field interacting with the background spacetime with a nontrivial asymptotic structure. The spacetime metric, obtained numerically in \cite{de2015gravitating}, forms the basis of our state-of-the-art numerical study. We make an exhaustive analysis and compare all the results in the non-abelian model with the corresponding abelian one for both massless and massive fields. We analyze the field configuration's total cross-section and angular profile at small and large distances from the core. We show that the total cross-section oscillates with the incident momentum of the wave, as anticipated in \cite{silva2021scattering}, and also, the angular profile can be explained reasonably well with a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, especially for the scalar field scattering.",
Cross submissions,Algebra structure of conformal Killing-Yano forms in geometries with skew-symmetric torsion,"Ãmit Ertem,ÃzgÃ¼r KelekÃ§i,ÃzgÃ¼r AÃ§Ä±k",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),We consider conformal Killing-Yano forms corresponding to the antisymmetric generalizations of conformal Killing vectors to higher degree forms in the presence of skew-symmetric torsion. Integrability conditions for torsionful conformal Killing-Yano forms are found and a graded Lie bracket for conformal Killing-Yano forms to constitute a graded Lie algebra structure is proposed. It is found that a graded Lie algebra structure for a special subset of torsionful conformal Killing-Yano forms can be constructed for a closed and parallel skew-symmetric torsion on constant curvature and Einstein manifolds. Similar structure for generalized hidden symmetries defined from generalized connection in generalized geometry is also constructed.,
Cross submissions,Entanglement measures for causally connected subregions and holography,"XiangKun Gong,Wu-zhong Guo,Jin Xu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In this paper, we investigate entanglement for causally connected subregions $A$ and $B$ in quantum field theory and holography. Recent developments have established that a transition operator $T_{AB}$ can be well-defined for such subregions, which is generally non-Hermitian. By employing the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and the real-time replica method, we show how to construct $T_{AB}$ and compute associated entanglement measures. In certain configurations, this leads to a notion of timelike entanglement entropy, for which we provide explicit quantum field theory computations and propose a holographic dual via analytic continuation from the Euclidean setup. Both analytical and numerical results are compared and found consistent.If entanglement between causally connected subregions is to be meaningful, it should also be able to define other entanglement measures. Motivated by the spacelike case, we propose a timelike extension of the entanglement wedge cross section, though we do not expect it to carry the same physical interpretation. In AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we compute explicit examples and find that the timelike entanglement wedge cross section is generally positive. Furthermore, we show that the reflected entropy for timelike intervals -- obtained via analytic continuation of twist correlators -- coincides with twice the timelike entanglement wedge cross section at leading order in $G$, supporting a holographic duality in the timelike case. We also discuss the extension of other entanglement measures, such as logarithmic negativity, to timelike separated regions using replica methods. We highlight conceptual challenges in defining reflected entropy via canonical purification for non-Hermitian operators.",
Cross submissions,Explorations of Universality in the Entropy and Hawking Radiation of Non-Extremal Kerr AdS$_4$ Black Holes,"Jun Nian,Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas,Wenni Zheng",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We comprehensively discuss various microscopic approaches to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for rotating, electrically charged, asymptotically AdS$_4$ non-extremal black holes in gauged supergravity. We apply the covariant phase space formalism to the near-horizon region to obtain a Cardy-formula-based microscopic explanation for the entropy, consistent with the Kerr/CFT correspondence. From the dual boundary CFT point of view, we estimate the free partition function in the matrix model approximation in the high-temperature regime and find qualitative agreement with the supergravity answer. All these different approaches match in the appropriate limits and support the universality of AdS black hole entropy even at high temperatures, far away from extremality. Prompted by the consistency of the results of statistical explanations for the AdS$_4$ black hole entropy, we discuss aspects of the rate of Hawking radiation at high temperatures from the CFT$_2$ perspective and found it to be universally proportional to the horizon area.",
Cross submissions,Violating Weak Cosmic Censorship in AdS$_3$ via Gedanken Experiment,Masaya Amo,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The weak cosmic censorship conjecture (wCCC) might not be as robust as one would expect. We present a potential counterexample to the wCCC in a rotating three-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS$_3$) spacetime. We extend the parameter range of the quantum corrected BTZ (qBTZ) black hole. We examine the infall of test particles with large orbital angular momentum into an extremal black hole. Our findings indicate that, under certain conditions -- such as neglecting the self-force effects -- the event horizon can be destroyed, leading to a violation of the wCCC. The results suggest that this solution should either be excluded from the applicability of the wCCC or should be examined with self-force effects incorporated.",
Cross submissions,"Cosmic string gravitational wave backgrounds at LISA: I. Signal survey, template reconstruction, and model comparison","Androniki Dimitriou,Daniel G. Figueroa,Peera Simakachorn,Bryan Zaldivar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present a catalog of gravitational wave background (GWB) signal templates from cosmic-string networks, based on relevant models proposed in the literature. We classify templates as conventional, based on standard cosmology and Nambu-Goto results (VOS and BOS), and beyond conventional, based on modifications of a) the loop number density (LRS, super, metastable, current-carrying strings), b) the expansion history (non-standard cosmologies, extra degrees of freedom, either thermal or secluded), or c) the loop properties (birth length, power emission). Using the SBI package $\texttt{GWBackFinder}$, we quantify the reconstruction precision of each signal by LISA, scanning over their parameter space, and performing model comparisons. For conventional signals, LISA reconstructs the tension $G\mu$ with an error $\lesssim 10\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-15}$, which decreases down to $2-3\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 10^{-12}$. BOS and VOS modelings become distinguishable confidently for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-13}$. For beyond-conventional signals, we identify SNR and error-threshold intervals for each parameter, and determine (for few examples) the regions where they can be distinguished from conventional signals. Analogous quality reconstruction studies of cosmic-string GWBs, superimposed over leading astrophysical foregrounds in the LISA window, will be presented in a series of upcoming papers.",
Cross submissions,Constraints on DBI dark energy with chameleon mechanism,"Burin Gumjudpai,Nandan Roy,John Ward",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we investigate the Dirac Born Infeld chameleon scalar field model in light of the latest cosmological observations, analyzing the model both with the incorporation of the chameleon mechanism and without it. Results from current cosmological observations, such as Pantheon Plus, DES Y5, DESI DR2, and the compressed Planck likelihood, are used to constrain the model. We consider the AdS throat in the form of $f(\phi) = \lambda / \phi^4$ and a potential $V(\phi) = m_0^2 \phi^2 + m_1^2 \phi^4$ .One interesting finding from our analysis is that, without the chameleon mechanism, the mean value of $m_1 \simeq 0$ indicates the self-interaction of the DBI field could potentially be negligible. Constraints on the potential parameters do not appear when considering the chameleon mechanism, but the warp parameter and chameleon coupling parameter are forced to satisfy $\eta \geq 0$ and $\beta \leq 0$. Different choices of $\beta$ render the same background cosmological parameters. The equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ resides more in the quintessence region in the past. There is no phantom crossing in this model under our assumption of the warp throat and potential. By computing the $\Delta \text{AIC}$ relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, we study statistical model comparison. The model as a candidate of dynamical dark energy is observationally viable at the cosmological background level.",
