New submissions,Alleviating the $H_0$ tension in Rastall gravity,"R. Mohebi,Kh. Saaidi T. Golanbari,K. Karami",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The tension between measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ locally and the value inferred from Planck satellite have provided a strong motivation to explore theoretical frameworks beyond the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM). To this aim, we investigate the $H_0$ tension in the Rastall $\Lambda$CDM model (R-$\Lambda$CDM), formulated within the Rastall gravity framework as a phenomenological extension of General Relativity featuring a non-conserved energy-momentum tensor. To constrain the cosmological parameters, we employ a comprehensive combined dataset including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Hubble parameter $H(z)$, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, and the growth rate of cosmic structures $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$. The estimation of model parameters is performed via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling within a Bayesian statistical framework. Our results show that the R-$\Lambda$CDM model, especially in closed geometry, reduces the $H_0$ tension, bringing the discrepancy with the local SH0ES measurements down to $1.97\sigma$ to $2.18\sigma$. However, the tension related to the $\sigma_8$ parameter remains unresolved.",
New submissions,Nonlinear diffusion in relativistic kinetic theory,Simone Calogero,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"A nonlinear Lorentz invariant kinetic diffusion equation is introduced, which is consistent with the conservation laws of particles number, energy and momentum. The equilibrium solution converges to the Maxwellian density in the Newtonian limit, but it is not given by the Jüttner distribution commonly employed in relativistic kinetic theory. The nonlinear kinetic diffusion equation on a general Lorentzian manifold is consistent with the contracted Bianchi identities and therefore can be coupled to the Einstein equations of general relativity.",
New submissions,Fermionic Love of Black Holes in General Relativity,"Sumanta Chakraborty,Pierre Heidmann,Paolo Pani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Black holes in General Relativity exhibit a remarkable feature: their response to static scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations -- as quantified by the so-called tidal Love numbers -- vanishes identically. We present the first exception to this rule: the Love numbers of a black hole perturbed by a fermionic field are nonzero. We derive a closed-form expression of these fermionic Love numbers for generic spin in the background of a Kerr black hole with arbitrary angular momentum. In contrast, we show that the fermionic dissipation numbers vanish for static perturbations, reflecting the absence of superradiance for fermions. These results highlight a fundamental distinction between bosonic and fermionic perturbations, which can be interpreted as a breaking of the hidden symmetries that underlie the vanishing of Love numbers in the bosonic sector.",
New submissions,Bondi-type accretion onto a Kerr black hole in the kinetic regime,"Patryk Mach,Mehrab Momennia,Olivier Sarbach",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We derive an exact solution representing a Bondi-type stationary accretion of a kinetic (Vlasov) gas onto the Kerr black hole. The solution is exact in the sense that relevant physical quantities, such as the particle current density or the accretion rates, are expressed as explicit integrals, which can be evaluated numerically. Whereas the angular momentum accretion rate is shown to vanish exactly, we provide an analytic approximation which allows us to obtain simple formulas for the mass and energy accretion rates. These formulas are used to derive characteristic time scales of the black hole mass growth and the associated spin-down in two different scenarios: assuming that the ambient energy density is either constant or decreases on a cosmological scale.",
New submissions,Chaos and Carter: Extreme-mass-ratio systems of relativistic rotating black holes in astrophysical environments,"Kyriakos Destounis,Pedro G. S. Fernandes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, where a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole, are prime sources of millihertz gravitational waves for upcoming space-based detectors. While most studies assume idealized vacuum backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in astrophysical environments, such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark matter spikes, disks and halos, that can significantly alter the orbital dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time, and map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of chaos. This manifests through resonant island and chaotic layer formations around transient orbital resonances in phase space; features that are otherwise completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit points. Non-integrability ensures that the periodicity of the central resonant point is shared throughout the island's geodesics, thus effectively enhancing the lifespan of resonances, beyond Kerr-based predictions. Therefore, they can subject distinct imprint on gravitational-wave signals, with significant consequences for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.",
New submissions,Gravitational-wave tails and memory effect for mergers in astrophysical environments,"Qassim Alnasheet,Vitor Cardoso,Francisco Duque,Rodrigo Panosso Macedo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Space Physics (physics.space-ph),"Gravitational waves from the coalescence of compact objects carry information about their dynamics and the spacetime in regions where they are evolving. In particular, late-time tails and memory effects after the merger are two low-frequency phenomena, not detectable by current instruments, but which can be observed by future detectors. Their low-frequency nature could, in principle, make them more sensitive to larger-scale structures at galactic length scales. We show that indeed there are transient features, such as amplitude changes, in both tails and (linear) memory when the merger occurs while immersed in an astrophysical environment. For realistic galaxies, the environment's compactness is small enough that the effect is strongly suppressed, but these effects could become relevant for mergers occurring in regions with matter overdensities, like the ones recently observed numerically for wave dark matter. On the other hand, the memory (the difference between the amplitude asymptotically early and late) and asymptotically late decay are independent on the properties of the environment.",
New submissions,Sourced Carrollian Fluids Dual to Black Hole Horizons,"Sercan Hüsnügil,Luis Lehner",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The (degenerate) geometry of event horizons is linked to Carrollian fluids. We investigate the behavior of event horizons via a perturbative coupling to a massless scalar field, making connections to Carrollian hydrodynamics with a driving source, and discuss the fluid equilibration in tandem with the horizon's relaxation to equilibrium. We observe that after the perturbation dies off, the Carrollian fluid energy and momentum densities approach equilibrium as the horizon asymptotically becomes non-expanding. We connect the equilibration of the Carrollian fluid dual to the black hole horizon through the expansion of its background geometry.",
New submissions,On black holes in new general relativity,"D. F. López,A. A. Coley,R. J. van den Hoogen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"New General Relativity (NGR) is a class of teleparallel theories defined by three free parameters, effectively reduced to two after appropriate normalization, which are subject to experimental constraints. In this framework, matter couples minimally to the metric, ensuring that test particles follow geodesics and that null congruence expansions can be employed to detect local horizons. Assuming such horizons exist, we demonstrate that all physically viable NGR models--including the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) and the one-parameter Hayashi and Shirafuji model (1P-H&S)--inevitably exhibit divergences in torsion scalars at the local horizon. This singular behavior obstructs the interpretation of these models and their associated teleparallel geometries as black hole configurations.",
New submissions,The Warp Drive: Superluminal Travel within General Relativity,Osvaldo L. Santos-Pereira,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed that the well-known special relativistic limitation that particles cannot travel with velocities higher than light speed can be bypassed when such trips are considered globally within specific general relativistic frameworks, using a warped region of spacetime in the shape of a bubble that transports particles with mass traveling through spacetime with superluminal speed. Although initial results indicated this scenario as nonphysical, since it would seem to require negative mass-energy density, recent theoretical analyses suggest that such a nonphysical situation may not always be true. This thesis presents newfound solutions for the Einstein field equations, considering the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime metrics. The central premise is to study the fluid matter as the gravity source, rather than the more common vacuum or negative energy sources, to explore the potential for generating superluminal velocities, or \textit{warp speeds}, through a warped region in the spacetime. Such solutions have various matter-energy sources: dust particles, perfect fluid, quasi-perfect fluid with anisotropic pressures, charged dust, and a perfect fluid within a cosmological constant spacetime.A connection between some of these solutions featuring shock waves described by a Burgers-type equation with a term on the right-hand side of the equation purely dependent on time is also shown. This could mean warp drives are closely related to vacuum energy and possibly have topological effects such as shock waves.",
New submissions,Spinning Effective-to-Backwards One Body ($\texttt{SEBOB}$): combining Effective One-Body inspirals and Backwards One-Body merger-ringdowns for aligned spin black hole binaries,"Siddharth Mahesh,Sean McWilliams,Zachariah Etienne",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"High-fidelity gravitational waveform models are essential for realizing the scientific potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. While highly accurate, state-of-the-art models often rely on extensive phenomenological calibrations to numerical relativity (NR) simulations for the late-inspiral and merger phases, which can limit physical insight and extrapolation to regions where NR data is sparse. To address this, we introduce the Spinning Effective-to-Backwards One Body (SEBOB) formalism, a hybrid approach that combines the well-established Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework with the analytically-driven Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model, which describes the merger-ringdown from first principles as a perturbation of the final remnant black hole. We present two variants building on the state-of-the-art $\texttt{SEOBNRv5HM}$ model: $\texttt{seobnrv5_nrnqc_bob}$, which retains standard NR-calibrated non-quasi-circular (NQC) corrections and attaches a BOB-based merger-ringdown; and a more ambitious variant, $\texttt{seobnrv5_bob}$, which uses BOB to also inform the NQC corrections, thereby reducing reliance on NR fitting and enabling higher-order ($\mathcal{C}^2$) continuity by construction. Implemented in the open-source $\texttt{NRPy}$ framework for optimized C-code generation, the SEBOB model is transparent, extensible, and computationally efficient. By comparing our waveforms to a large catalog of NR simulations, we demonstrate that SEBOB yields accuracies comparable to the highly-calibrated $\texttt{SEOBNRv5HM}$ model, providing a viable pathway towards more physically motivated and robust waveform models",
New submissions,The shadows and photon rings of two minimal deformations of Schwarzschild black holes,"Hong-Er Gong,Junlin Qin,Yusen Wang,Bofeng Wu,Zhan-Feng Mai,Sen Guo,Enwei Liang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper primarily investigates the optical characteristics of two minimal Schwarzschild black hole deformations - the Kazakov-Solodukhin and Ghosh-Kumar black holes - under different accretion models. The event horizon, photon sphere, and critical impact parameter of the former increase compared with the Schwarzschild black hole, but those of the latter decrease. The data from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration are used to constrain the parameter ranges of the two black holes. In the case of spherical accretion, the quantum correction of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole leads to the increase of black hole shadow size and the decrease of integrated intensity, while the shadow size of magnetically charged Ghosh-Kumar black hole decreases and the integrated intensity increases. The shadow radius of the black hole is independent of the spherical accretion models. For an optically and geometrically thin accretion disk, the integrated intensity is mainly contributed by direct emission, and the contributions of photon rings and lensed rings are very small. In addition, the photon rings and lensed rings of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole are narrower, while those of Ghosh-Kumar black hole are wider. Whereas the Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole exhibits higher brightness, the Ghosh-Kumar black hole shows lower brightness. Additionally, a disk closer to the black hole correlates with a smaller shadow radius. This paper proposes a method to distinguish different black holes in a specific thin disk model.",
New submissions,Self-regularized entropy: How much do quantum black holes violate the no-hair theorem?,"Shokoufe Faraji,Niayesh Afshordi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We compute the canonical (brick wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a quantum black hole whose exterior is described, to first order in a small quadrupole parameter, by the static $q$-metric, which is an exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations. Counting near horizon quasinormal modes shows that a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy of Hawking radiation is finite for any non-vanishing quadrupole, without an ad hoc cutoff. Matching this canonical entropy to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy leads to no-hair violating multipoles, at percent-to-tens-of-percent level, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).",
New submissions,Preventing Singularity Problem in $f(R)$ Dark Energy Models,"Romy Hanang Setya Budhi,Nehla Shobcha,Norma Sidik Risdianto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The curvature singularity problem in $f(R)$ dark energy models poses a significant challenge to their viability as alternatives to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we investigate the possibility of resolving this issue by incorporating higher-order corrections that are compatible with the inflationary phase. We analyze the effects of adding $R^2$, $R^{\frac{m+2}{m+1}}$ and $\alpha$-attractor representation in $f(R)$ gravity terms to types of dark energy $f(R)$ models, focusing on their ability to prevent singularities in high-density environments. Our results demonstrate that these corrections can effectively stabilize the models, ensuring their consistency across both inflationary and late-time cosmological scales.",
New submissions,Instability mechanisms on asymptotically AdS black hole backgrounds,"Filip Ficek,Maciej Maliborski",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),We investigate dynamics of the conformal scalar equation with defocusing cubic nonlinearity and Robin boundary conditions on the Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter background. At certain parts of the parameters phase space the zero solution ceases to be stable. We present two mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon.,
New submissions,Numerical computation of electromagnetically sourced nonlinear tails,"Zhen-Tao He,Jia Du,Jiageng Jiao,Caiying Shao,Junxi Shi,Yu Tian,Hongbao Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Amazingly, recent studies indicate that nonlinear effects are of great significance for modelling black hole ringdown. Transient electromagnetic events in the astrophysical environment are typically high-energetic, potentially responsible for some nonlinearities in ringdown. Motivated by the desire to understand these nonlinearities, we solve the inhomogeneous Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky equation numerically, and find second-order gravitational tails induced by an electromagnetic source. Our results suggest that the second-order tails of curvature perturbations with multipole numbers $l\geq4$ decay as $t^{-2l-2}$ at fixed spatial position and $u^{-l-3}$ in retarded-time $u$ at null infinity, slower than their linear counterparts, which can play a role in multi-messenger observations.",
New submissions,Gravitational Memory in Generalized Proca Gravity,"Lavinia Heisenberg,Benedetta Rosatello,Guangzi Xu,Jann Zosso",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the gravitational memory effect in the full Generalized Proca gravity, the most general metric theory including a gravitational Proca field with derivative self-interactions that still maintains second-order equations of motion. Building on our previous works on memory in other massless and massive metric theories, we extend a unified framework for computing displacement memory and apply it to Generalized Proca gravity. We identify two non-trivial physically distinct classes of background conditions of Generalized Proca theory within the assumption of asymptotic flatness: a Lorentz-invariant but massive case, and a Lorentz-violating, massless case. The former exhibits dispersive scalar and vector modes and allows a Horndeski-like treatment of memory, while the latter resembles the asymptotic dynamics of Einstein-Æther theory including the same Lorentz-breaking effects on displacement memory. In both cases, we derive the fully gauge invariant and dynamical second order action, derive the effective stress-energy tensor and study its contribution to the memory integral. We highlight the distinction between phase and group velocity in the tensor memory formula sourced by dispersive propagating modes. Finally, we re-emphasize how observational constraints on Lorentz violation may be imposed by the structure of the memory signal.",
New submissions,A new type of multi-branch periodic orbits in dyonic black holes,"Chao-Hui Wang,Yu-Peng Zhang,Tao Zhu,Shao-Wen Wei",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we investigate bound periodic orbits of timelike particles in the spacetime of dyonic black holes arising from quasi-topological electromagnetic theory. By varying the coupling parameter $\alpha_1$, the corresponding black hole solutions exhibit diverse horizon structures, including naked singularities and black holes with one to four horizons. We find that for sufficiently small $\alpha_1$, the metric function $f(r)$ becomes non-monotonic outside the event horizon in spacetimes with one or two horizons, while in all other cases, $f(r)$ remains strictly monotonic. In the non-monotonic regime, the radial effective potential develops a double-barrier structure, allowing the emergence of multiple marginally bound orbits and multiple branches of periodic orbits associated with the same rational number $l$. Although differing in radial structure, these orbit branches are topologically equivalent. Remarkably, when the outer potential barrier exceeds unity, bound orbits with energy $E>1$ become possible, in addition to the standard $E<1$ branches. When the peak reaches $E=1$, up to three distinct bound orbit branches may coexist. We also identify a novel eccentricity behavior, the innermost branch becomes increasingly circular with increasing energy or angular momentum, while outer branches exhibit greater eccentricity and a larger apastron-periastron separation. These features, absent in previous studies, are unique signatures of non-monotonic metric functions. In contrast, monotonic cases yield a single-well potential, a unique marginally bound orbit, and a single periodic orbit branch per $q$, consistent with earlier findings. Our results highlight the critical role of the metric function's shape in determining the orbital structure around dyonic black holes.",
New submissions,Lensing and Photon Rings in a Magnetized Black Hole Spacetime,"Muhammad Haider Khan,Volker Perlick",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze gravitational lensing, in particular the shadow and photon rings, in the Ernst spacetime, also known as the Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime, which describes a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a homogenous magnetic field. Although the geodesic equation in this spacetime is chaotic, there are some relevant features that can be determined analytically. Among other things, we give analytic formulas for the vertical diameter of the shadow for an observer at arbitrary inclination and for the horizontal diameter of the shadow for an observer in the equatorial plane. Moreover, we use the strong-deflection formalism for analytically calculating the so-called photon rings of order $\ge 2$ and we use the recently introduced gap parameter $\Delta _2$ for distinguishing lensing of an Ernst black hole from that of a Schwarzschild black hole.",
New submissions,On fine alignment of transmitted beams for TianQin with far-field wavefront error,"Dezhi Wang,Xuefeng Zhang,Hui-Zong Duan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"TianQin is a proposed space-based gravitational wave detector mission that employs inter-satellite laser interferometry. Suppressing measurement noise and achieving high sensitivity require accurate alignment of multiple onboard interferometers after laser link acquisition. However, due to huge armlengths and varying point-ahead angles, the fine alignment of the transmitted beams can be particularly challenging, which needs to take into account both received laser power and far-field wavefront errors. To tackle this issue for TianQin which has small point-ahead angle variations, we propose an efficient alignment strategy that relies on finding the maximum-intensity direction of the transmitted beam as the alignment reference. The direction can be estimated through a quatrefoil scan of the local transmitted beam and the corresponding intensity measurement from the remote satellite. Under TianQin's fixed-value compensation of the point-ahead angles, simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy is capable of aligning the transmitted beams within 20 nrad from the mean value of the point-ahead angles, while the tilt-to-length coupling associated with far-field wavefront error can meet the requirement given a transmitted beam aberration of $\lambda/40$ RMS.",
New submissions,Incorporating curved geometry in cosmological simulations,"Julian Adamek,Renan Boschetti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Spatial curvature is one of the fundamental cosmological parameters that is routinely constrained from observations. The forward modelling of observations, in particular of large-scale structure, often relies on large cosmological simulations. While the so-called separate universe approach allows one to account for the effect of curvature on the expansion rate in small sub-volumes, the non-Euclidean geometry is harder to accommodate. It becomes important when observables are computed over large distances, e.g. when photons travel to us from high redshift. Here we present a fully relativistic framework to run cosmological simulations for curved spatial geometry. The issue of consistent boundary conditions is solved by embedding a spherical cap of the curved spacetime into a hole within a flat exterior, where it can undergo free expansion. The geometric nature of gravity is made explicit in our framework, allowing for a consistent forward modelling of observables inside the curved patch. Our methodology would also work with any Newtonian code to a good approximation, requiring changes only to the initial conditions and post-processing.",
New submissions,Exploring density dependent B as a suitable parameter in higher dimensional approach with a non-linear equation of state,"Koushik Ballav Goswami,Debadri Bhattacharjee,Anirban Saha,Pradip Kumar Chattopadhyay",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this investigation, we present a singularity free interior solution of the Einstein field equation for a class of anisotropic compact objects in dimensions $D\geq4$. In accordance with the concept of Vaidya and Tikekar, the geometry of the physical $(D-1)$-space of a star corresponding to $t=constant$ hypersurface is assumed to be of a $(D-1)$ spheroid. For the fulfilment of causality condition, a limit of the spheroidal parameter ($\lambda$) is noted depending on the values of amount of anisotropy ($\alpha$) and space-time dimensions ($D$). We note that by switching off the extra parameters ($\alpha$ and $D$), previously obtained limit of $\lambda$ can be generated. To validate our findings, we compare the results obtained from our model with observational data of PSR J1614-2230 (mass=$1.908^{+0.016}_{-0.016}M_{\odot}$, radius=$11.93^{+0.50}_{-0.50}km$). It is noted that the best fit equation of state corresponds to polynomial equation of state of the order of five. We use this finding to develop a density dependent MIT bag model which seems to be useful for the correct description of compact object in our model. The mass radius relation shows that our model mimics a wide range of recently observed pulsars in four and higher dimensions. Furthermore, we also found that our model exhibits stability according to Generalised TOV equation, Herrera cracking condition, and the adiabatic index.",
New submissions,Challenging $Λ$CDM with Higher-Order GUP Corrections,"Andronikos Paliathanasis,Genly Leon,Yoelsy Leyva,Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano,Amare Abebe",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study quantum corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM model model arising from a minimum measurable length in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We focus on a higher-order Generalized Uncertainty Principle, beyond the quadratic form. This generalized GUP introduces two free parameters, and we determine the modified Friedmann equation. This framework leads to a perturbative cosmological model that naturally reduces to $\Lambda$CDM in an appropriate limiting case of the deformation parameters. We construct the modified cosmological scenario, analyze its deviations from the standard case, and examine it as a mechanism for the description of dynamical dark energy. To constrain the model, we employ Cosmic Chronometers, the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI DR2 release, and Supernova data from the PantheonPlus and Union3 catalogues. Our analysis indicates that the modified GUP model is statistically competitive with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, providing comparable or even improved fits to some of the combined datasets. Moreover, the data constrain the deformation parameter of the GUP model, with the preferred value found to be negative, which corresponds to a phantom regime in the effective dynamical dark energy description.",
New submissions,Static spacetimes with a Finsler angular sector,Erasmo Caponio,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider static spacetimes in spherical coordinates whose angular sector is described by a Finsler metric rather than the standard round metric on $S^2$. Our first contribution is kinematical: keeping the lapse and radial factors $e^{\nu(r)}$, $e^{\vartheta(r)}$ arbitrary and using only Killing symmetries and the null constraint, we derive model--independent relations for circular photon orbits and the effective dynamics. Specializing the Finsler metric to a positive constant flag curvature Randers sphere we derive exact expressions for the conserved angular charge and the critical impact parameter, and we quantify a Finslerian Sagnac--type effect. Our second contribution is dynamical: we consider the field equations used in the literature to fix $(e^{\nu},e^{\vartheta})$. We revisit the hairy black hole family in a recent paper by Nekouee et al. demonstrating that the equatorial restriction employed in such a work eliminates the genuinely Finslerian features and showing that the claimed new solutions reproduce previously known results obtained by Ovalle et al.",
New submissions,"Upper Limits on the Isotropic Gravitational-Wave Background from the first part of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA's fourth Observing Run","TheLIGO Scientific Collaboration, theVirgo Collaboration, theKAGRA Collaboration",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present results from the search for an isotropic gravitational-wave background using Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data from O1 through O4a, the first part of the fourth observing run. This background is the accumulated signal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes information about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the Universe, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from the early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically significant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical scenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3 power-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(25{\rm Hz})\leq 2.0\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement over previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(25{\rm Hz})\leq 2.8\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x sensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting non-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise sources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with population models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we find our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are approaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits shown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary black hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference results and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background arising from compact binary coalescences is $\Omega_{\rm CBC}(25{\rm Hz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest contribution is due to binary black holes only, $\Omega_{\rm BBH}(25{\rm Hz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\times 10^{-9}$.",
New submissions,Singularity Resolution of Quantum Black Holes in (A)dS,Sofie Ried,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The singularities present at the centre of black holes signal a break down of the classical theory. In this paper, we demonstrate a resolution of the Schwarzschild-(Anti-)de Sitter singularity by imposing unitary evolution with respect to unimodular time. Employing the Henneaux-Teitelboim formulation of unimodular gravity, we perform a canonical quantization on a symmetry-reduced Schwarzschild-(Anti-) de Sitter model. This leads to a Wheeler-DeWitt equation that effectively becomes a Schrödinger equation in unimodular time. By imposing unitarity, we discover a family of quantum theories in which the classical singularity is resolved. These theories each allow only semiclassical states corresponding to one mass sign: either positive, negative, or zero. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild metric, which is modified by a new length scale $r_{min}$ that governs the black hole's transition to a white hole.",
New submissions,Images of the accretion disk in Hybrid metric-Palatini gravity,"P.I. Dyadina,N.A. Avdeev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper we obtain and study images of accretion disks around static spherically symmetric black holes in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. Semi-analytic ray-tracing methods in curved spacetime are employed to generate the images of the disk for different scalar field configurations, including both Higgs-type potentials and cases without a potential. The resulting images, including both redshift and intensity maps, are analyzed. The results show that the scalar field parameters play a significant role in shaping both the direct and secondary images of the disk, while the inclination angle primarily affects the asymmetry and brightness distribution. In particular, configurations with extreme scalar field values lead to cooler and dimmer disk compared to General Relativity. Furthermore, the structure and angular size of the secondary ring exhibit noticeable deviations from General Relativity, offering a potential observational signature. Through direct comparison between hybrid metric-Palatini gravity and General Relativity images, we conclude that future high-resolution observations of black hole shadows could effectively distinguish this modified gravitational theory and constrain underlying scalar field parameters.",
New submissions,Scalar-gravitational quasinormal modes and echoes in a five dimensional thick brane,"Weike Deng,Sheng Long,Qin Tan,Zu-Cheng Chen,Jiliang Jing",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The scalar perturbations of thick braneworld models provide critical insights into their matter-geometry relationship, distinct from tensor modes. This work systematically investigates quasinormal modes and gravitational echoes from scalar perturbations in a thick brane model exhibiting internal structure and brane splitting. Using the WKB method, direct integration, and Bernstein spectral techniques, we compute quasinormal frequencies across different parameter regimes, addressing both single and double-barrier effective potentials. Time-domain evolution of wave packets reveals clear echo signals for split brane configurations ($s > 1, \delta > 1$), produced by successive reflections between sub-branes. A key finding is the position-dependence of echo modes within the extra dimension: observers located on a sub-brane detect clean periodic signals, whereas those situated between sub-branes observe more complex, modulated waveforms. This effect offers a distinct signature of the brane's internal structure. The observed echoes, along with consistent frequency- and time-domain results, advance the understanding of thick brane dynamics and open an observational window into warped extra dimensions. Moreover, the similarity between the effective potential in thick brane scenarios and those of black holes and wormholes offers valuable perspectives for studying echo-related phenomena in these gravitational systems.",
New submissions,First-Order Viscous Relativistic Hydrodynamics on the Two-Sphere,"Lennox S. Keeble,Frans Pretorius",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A few years ago, Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) formulated the first causal, stable, strongly hyperbolic, and locally well-posed theory of first-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics. Since their inception, there have been several numerical and analytic studies of the BDNK equations which have revealed their promise in modeling relativistic flows when viscous, first-order corrections to ideal hydrodynamics are important. In this paper, we present numerical solutions to the BDNK equations for a $4$D conformal fluid in Minkowski spacetime constrained to the surface of a geometric sphere. We numerically solve the underlying equations of motion by use of finite difference methods applied in cubed-sphere coordinates -- a multi-block grid structure which regularly and continuously covers the surface of a sphere. We present three test cases of our code: linearized fluid perturbations of equilibrium states, a smooth, stationary initial Gaussian pulse of energy density, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable initial data. In the Gaussian test case with sufficiently large entropy-normalized shear viscosity, the flow, though initialized in equilibrium, dynamically diverges away from equilibrium and the regime of validity of first-order hydrodynamics as very steep gradients form in the solution, causing convergence to be lost in the numerical simulation. This behavior persists at all grid resolutions we have considered, and also occurs at much higher resolutions in simulations of planar-symmetric ($1+1$)D conformal flows. These solutions provide numerical evidence that singularities in solutions to the BDNK equations can form in finite time from smooth initial data. The numerical methods we employ on the two-sphere can be readily extended to include variations in the radial direction, allowing for full ($3+1$)D simulations of the BDNK equations in astrophysical applications.",
Cross submissions,Testing $f(T)$ Gravity with Cosmological Observations: Confronting the Hubble Tension and Implications for the Late-Time Universe,"Saurabh Verma,Archana Dixit,Anirudh Pradhan,M. S. Barak",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In recent years, modifications to General Relativity (GR) have been explored to address cosmological observations, particularly in the context of late-time cosmic acceleration. Among these, modifications based on the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), particularly $f(T)$ gravity, have gained significant attention. In this work, we investigate the scalar perturbations in $f(T)$ gravity, focusing on how these perturbations modify the Poisson and lensing equations and how they impact cosmological observables. By incorporating observational data from cosmic chromatometers, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the DESI BAO survey, and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), we derive constraints on the parameters of the $f(T)$ power-law model. Our results suggest that $f(T)$ gravity can effectively alleviate some of the tensions observed in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including the Hubble constant ($H_0$) discrepancy. Furthermore, the evolution of the supernova luminosity and its dependence on the gravitational constant are considered to refine the measurement of cosmological parameters. The model's ability to address the $H_0$ tension is critically examined, and we find that $f(T)$ gravity offers a viable alternative to the standard model. The work concludes by comparing the fits of the $f(T)$ gravity model to the $\Lambda$CDM model using various information criteria, revealing key insights into the viability of modified gravity in contemporary cosmology.",
Cross submissions,Prospects for EMRI/MBH parameter estimation using Quasi-Periodic Eruption timings: short-timescale analysis,"Joheen Chakraborty,Lisa V. Drummond,Matteo Bonetti,Alessia Franchini,Shubham Kejriwal,Giovanni Miniutti,Riccardo Arcodia,Scott A. Hughes,Francisco Duque,Erin Kara,Alberto Sesana,Margherita Giustini,Amedeo Motta,Kevin Burdge",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are luminous, recurring X-ray outbursts from galactic nuclei, with timescales of hours to days. While their origin remains uncertain, leading models invoke accretion disk instabilities or the interaction of a massive black hole (MBH) with a lower-mass secondary in an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI). EMRI scenarios offer a robust framework for interpreting QPEs by characterizing observational signatures associated with the secondary's orbital dynamics. This, in turn, enables extraction of the MBH/EMRI physical properties and provides a means to test the EMRI scenario, distinguishing models and addressing the question: what can QPE timings teach us about massive black holes and EMRIs? In this study, we employ analytic expressions for Kerr geodesics to efficiently resolve the trajectory of the secondary object and perform GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference to assess the information content of QPE timings. Using our inference framework, referred to as QPE-FIT (Fast Inference with Timing), we explore QPE timing constraints on astrophysical parameters, such as EMRI orbital parameters and MBH mass/spin. We find that mild-eccentricity EMRIs ($e\sim0.1-0.3$) can constrain MBH mass and EMRI semimajor axis/eccentricity to the 10% level within tens of orbital periods, while MBH spin is unconstrained for the explored semimajor axes $\geq 100R_g$ and monitoring baselines $\mathcal{O}(10-100\rm)$ orbits. Introducing a misaligned precessing disk generally degrades inference of EMRI orbital parameters, but can constrain disk precession properties within 10-50%. This work both highlights the prospect of QPE observations as dynamical probes of galactic nuclei and outlines the challenge of doing so in the multimodal parameter space of EMRI-disk collisions.",
Cross submissions,"Black Holes, Entanglement and Decoherence",Gautam Satishchandran,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"It was recently shown that a black hole (or any Killing horizon) will decohere any quantum superposition in their vicinity. I review three distinct but equivalent arguments that illustrate how this phenomenon arises: (1) entanglement with ""degrees of freedom"" in the interior (2) the absorption of soft, entangling radiation emitted by the superposition and (3) interactions with the quantum, fluctuating multipole moments of a black hole arising from ultra low frequency Hawking quanta. The relationship between ""soft hair"" and interactions with ""internal degrees of freedom"" is emphasized and some implications for the nature of horizons in a quantum theory of gravity are discussed.",
Cross submissions,$F$-term Multi-Field Inflation in Supergravity without Stabiliser Superfields,"Jinn-Ouk Gong,Sergei V. Ketov,Takahiro Terada",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Realising $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to the well-known $\eta$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the Kähler potential, but this often leads to a negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic instabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens the theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity.",
Cross submissions,Impact of rotation on magnetic field stability and orientation in isolated neutron stars,"Fabrizio Venturi Piñas,Anson Ka Long Yip,Patrick Chi-Kit Cheong,Milton Ruiz",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Neutron stars are the most compact horizonless objects in the Universe, exhibiting the strongest known magnetic fields. They are potential sources of coincident gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across the entire spectrum. However, the internal configuration of their magnetic fields and the mechanisms that stabilize them remain open questions. As a step forward in understanding the timescale for the emergence of magnetic instabilities that disrupt stellar field configurations, we study the impact of stellar rotation using three-dimensional general relativistic numerical simulations of uniformly rotating, isolated neutron stars threaded by strong, poloidal, pulsar-like magnetic fields. The initial stellar configurations assume perfect conductivity and are stationary and axisymmetric. We explore a range of angular velocities, from non-rotating stars to those near the mass-shedding limit. We find that the stars spontaneously develop differential rotation, which triggers the appearance of a strong toroidal magnetic field component. Non-rotating neutron stars are unstable to the Tayler and Parker instabilities, which significantly change the magnetic field geometry. These instabilities lead to a rapid reduction of the initial magnetic energy by $\sim 99\%$ within $\sim 4$ Alfvén times of their onset. In contrast, rotation significantly delays the development of these instabilities and, in some cases, mitigates their effects. Highly rotating models retain up to $\sim 30\%$ of their magnetic energy for at least $\sim 10$ Alfvén times. Our results suggest that rotation plays a crucial role in stabilizing the magnetic field of neutron stars, regardless of its initial configuration.",
Cross submissions,Flexible Spectral Separation of Multiple Isotropic and Anisotropic Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds in LISA,"Alexander W. Criswell,Sharan Banagiri,Jessica Lawrence,Levi Schult,Steven Rieck,Stephen R. Taylor,Vuk Mandic",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe mHz gravitational waves from a wide variety of astrophysical sources. Of these, some will be characterizable as individual deterministic signals; the remainder will overlap to create astrophysical confusion noise. These sources of confusion noise are known as stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). LISA data is expected to include several such astrophysical SGWBs, including the notable Galactic binary foreground, SGWBs from white dwarf binary populations in satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and the SGWB from extragalactic stellar-origin binary black holes far from merger. To characterize these astrophysical signals and attempt to seek out possible underlying backgrounds of cosmological origin, it will be necessary to separate the contribution of each SGWB from that of the others. Crucially, several of these SGWBs are expected to be highly anisotropic on the sky, providing a powerful tool for spectral separation. To this end, we present BLIP 2.0: a flexible, GPU-accelerated framework for simulation and Bayesian analysis of arbitrary combinations of isotropic and anisotropic SGWBs. We leverage these capabilities to demonstrate for the first time spectral separation of the Galactic foreground, the Large Magellanic Cloud SGWB, and the SGWB from extragalactic stellar-origin binaries, and show a proof-of-concept for placing upper limits on the detection of an underlying isotropic cosmological SGWB in the presence of multiple astrophysical foregrounds.",

Zurek",Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph),"According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the density of topological defects created during a second-order phase transition is determined by the correlation length at the freeze-out time. This suggests that the final configuration of topological defects in such a transition is largely established during the impulse regime, soon after the critical point is traversed. Motivated by this, we conjecture that machine learning (ML) can predict the final configuration of topological defects based on the time evolution of the order parameter over a short interval in the vicinity of the critical point, well before the order parameter settles into the emerging new minima resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we show that the predictability of ML also follows the power law scaling dictated by KZM. We demonstrate these using a Recurrent Neural Network.",
Cross submissions,Spacetime Density Matrix: Formalism and Properties,Wu-zhong Guo,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"In this paper, we develop the general formalism and properties of the spacetime density matrix, which captures correlations among different Cauchy surfaces and can be regarded as a natural generalization of the standard density matrix defined on a single Cauchy surface. We present the construction of the spacetime density matrix in general quantum systems and its representation via the Schwinger Keldysh path integral. We further introduce a super-operator framework, within which the spacetime density matrix appears as a special case, and discuss possible generalizations from this perspective. We also show that the spacetime density matrix satisfies a Liouville von Neumann type equation of motion. When considering subsystems, a reduced spacetime density matrix can be defined by tracing over complementary degrees of freedom. We study the general properties of its moments and, in particular, derive universal short time behavior of the second moment. We find that coupling between subsystems plays a crucial role in obtaining nontrivial results. Assuming weak coupling, we develop a perturbative method to compute the moments systematically.",

Li,T. Hertog",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Detailed stellar evolution and supernova models yield a bimodal black-hole mass distribution with a narrow peak around 10 solar masses from stars within a narrow range of progenitor properties and a second broader peak starting around 20 solar masses from very massive progenitors. This bimodal black-hole mass distribution leads to a characteristic distribution of chirp masses of merging binary black holes, with two main peaks arising from the merger of two black holes where both come either from the low- or the high-mass peak and a smaller peak in between from the mixed merger of a low-mass and a high-mass black hole. We carry out a population synthesis study of binary black hole formation and compare the results to the observed chirp masses of gravitational-wave events. We find that only the bimodal black-hole mass prescription is able to reproduce the structure of peaks and gaps in the observed chirp-mass distribution, which is not matched by predictions from other remnant mass prescriptions in the literature.",

Vice versa, neglecting the DF of the spike systematically yields longer inspiral times.",
Cross submissions,Constraints on Logarithmic Model Extensions of Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity,"Purnendu Karmakar,Sandeep Haridasu,Atsushi Nishizawa",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We address various cosmological phenomenologies in the symmetric teleparallel framework both in background and perturbation such as cosmic expansion, gravitational coupling constant, gravitational waves propagation. Focusing on logarithmic extensions of $f(Q)$ models, we performed Bayesian analysis using the most-recent cosmological data, DESI DR2, Pantheon+. We also utilized a compilation of redshift space distortions ($f \sigma_8$) dataset to constrain the growth of structures in each of the models modulated by the effective gravitational coupling. We find that our extended Logarithmic $f(Q)$ models are well-constrained by the current cosmological data and are able to describe the late-time cosmic acceleration. The inverse Logarithmic model we introduce is also able to accommodate a phantom-like dark energy equation of state at late times, which is consistent with the recent DESI DR2 observations. We report explicitly predictions for the effective gravitational coupling ($\mu$), and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave ($\nu$) solely based on the background data, which can be tested against future observations. While the two Log-based extensions we have introduced here perform equivalently on the background level, they provide contrasting predictions for the evolution of effective Gravitational constant and propagation of gravitational waves, which should be constrained against the future perturbation data.",
