New submissions,Gravitational Waves from the Big Bang,Lucas Martins Barreto Alves,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"For millennia, humanity has relied exclusively on light$\unicode{x2014}$initially visible light and, later, broader and broader portions of the electromagnetic spectrum$\unicode{x2014}$to observe the universe. In the past decade, a remarkable chapter in extending astronomy beyond electromagnetic antennas has been concretized: the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy has opened a new observational window into the cosmos. Among the many new astronomical sources we may now look for and study through their gravitational-wave signals, the Big Bang is surely among the most fascinating. Gravitational waves give us concrete hope of directly observing the primordial universe, whose light, emitted more than 13.7 billion years ago, is blocked from reaching our telescopes. This dissertation is aimed at the study of gravitational waves from cosmic inflation, the main scientific paradigm for the very early universe. Therefore, the text is divided into chapters on gravitational waves, inflationary cosmology, and inflationary gravitational waves. More specifically, our discussion will be steered by the endeavor to explain how the gravitational-wave signal sought by the NANOGrav observatory could have originated in the primordial universe.",
New submissions,Price's law from quasinormal modes,"Paolo Arnaudo,Benjamin Withers",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We show that Price's power-law tail for perturbations of Schwarzschild, $t^{-2\ell-3}$ as $t\to \infty$, can be obtained from a sum of Schwarzschild-de Sitter quasinormal modes in the limit $\Lambda \to 0^+$.",
New submissions,Krylov Complexity in Canonical Quantum Cosmology,"Meysam Motaharfar,Maxwell R. Siebersma,Parampreet Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We explore Krylov complexity for two exactly solvable models, one in the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) quantum cosmology and another in loop quantum cosmology (LQC), for a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe sourced with a massless scalar field, which serves the role of clock. While the WDW quantization of this model cannot avoid the big bang/big crunch singularity, it is replaced by a big bounce in LQC. We construct the Krylov basis analytically by applying the Lanczos algorithm and evaluate both the Krylov state and operator complexity. In regimes where the wave function of the universe is sharply peaked, our results indicate that the Krylov complexity grows quadratically with the scalar field clock for the state and operator complexities in both the WDW quantum cosmology and LQC. We further show that operator complexity is exactly twice the state complexity in these regimes. We discuss the interpretation of the global behavior of these systems by calculating the Krylov entropy for both quantum cosmological frameworks. We observe that in LQC, the Krylov complexity and entropy remain finite at the bounce, whereas in the WDW quantum cosmology, they diverge at the big bang/crunch singularity. Our work paves the way for computing Krylov complexity in more intricate quantum cosmological models, including those exhibiting phenomena such as quantum chaos.",
New submissions,Efficient Search for Detection Candidates Using a Peak Finder Strategy for All-Sky-All-Frequency Gravitational Wave Radiometer,"Arindam Sharma,Deepali Agarwal,Sanjit Mitra",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The first all-sky-all-frequency (ASAF) radiometer search was conducted using data from the first three observing runs of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The significance of this search lies in its fast and unmodeled approach, leveraging a cross-correlation technique to identify common signals across the detector network. As a result, this method serves as an excellent alternative to search for unknown or poorly modeled continuous wave sources and narrowband components of the gravitational wave (GW) background. For continuous wave sources whose waveform can be modeled, this method can serve as the first stage of a hierarchical scheme by identifying sub-threshold candidates to be followed up with more optimal but computationally expensive searches. The ASAF search, however, presently suffers from beam smearing, where multiple candidates may arise due to the same noise fluctuations, detector artifact, or a GW source. This can reduce the detection probability in follow-up analyzes, especially with limited computing resources. To mitigate this issue and reduce the number of correlated and unnecessary candidates, we introduce a novel Peak Finder algorithm. This algorithm helps identifying the most representative candidates while preserving detection sensitivity, thereby allowing follow up of a much larger number of independent candidates. The reduction in correlated samples leads to a significant reduction in False Dismissal Rate (FDR) using the Peak Finder method compared to the Full-sky method. For instance, following up 2 Peak Finder candidates at 30 Hz reduces FDR by a factor of 3.",
New submissions,The $μ$-deformed Einstein field equations with $μ$-dependent effective cosmological constant,"O.P. Mykhailiv,Yu.A. Mishchenko,A.M. Gavrilik",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this paper, we derive the $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach. The basic role of deformation parameter is shown: it provides the possibility to vary the value of the cosmological constant. Due to this, we suggest an interesting treatment of the cosmological constant (CC) problem within the framework of $\mu$-deformation. Namely, viewing the derived $\mu$-deformed CC as an effective one and varying the parameter $\mu$ appropriately, we gain the possibility to drastically reduce the CC, so as to get for it the realistic value. Also, the relation with dark matter is discussed.",
New submissions,Wave Front Sensing demodulated at the difference frequency between two phase-modulation sidebands in a compound interferometer configuration for a gravitational-wave detector,"Chiaki Hirose,Kenta Tanaka,Osamu Miyakawa,Takafumi Ushiba",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Precise alignment sensing and control are essential for maintaining the stability of laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, ""Phase-Modulated-sideband $\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing"" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors.",
New submissions,Quintessence Star Solutions with Conformal Symmetry in a Durgapal Spacetime,"Meghanil Sinha,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The accelerated expansion of the Universe can be suitably attributed to the existence of the dark energy (DE). On the backdrop of this concept, this paper introduces a novel, anisotropic compact star model whose stability and structure are governed by the presence of quintessence field, defined by the parameter $ w_{Q} (-1<w_{Q}<-\frac{1}{3}) $ and which admits conformal symmetry. The construction of the model relied on the Durgapal-Fuloria (DP) metric formulation. The model successfully meets all the necessary physical constraints viz., TOV equation, energy conditions, compactness factor, surface redshift and casuality condition. The results are analyzed through analytical methods as well as through the graphical visualization for the various physical attributes.",
New submissions,"Late-time cosmic dynamics in $f(R,L_{m})$ gravity with recent observations","Amit Samaddar,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we investigate the late-time cosmic dynamics in the framework of non-linear $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, adopting the functional form $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^2$. To explore the dark energy behavior, we assume an oscillatory parametric equation of state, $\omega(z) = \omega_0 + b \sin[\log(1+z)]$, which allows smooth deviations from the cosmological constant. Using a joint MCMC analysis with the latest Hubble 31 chronometer data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon+, DES-SN5Y and Union 3), we obtain well-constrained parameters around $H_0 \simeq 67.2~\text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\omega_0\approx-0.5$, consistent with Planck 2018 and other current observations. The model exhibits a clear transition from deceleration to acceleration with $z_{\rm tr} \sim 0.7$--$0.8$, satisfies the NEC and DEC while violating the SEC and yields present EoS values close to $-1$, reproducing $\Lambda$CDM behavior at late times. The derived Universe ages ($t_0 \approx 13.3~\text{Gyr}$) agree well with CMB and stellar constraints, confirming that the proposed oscillatory $f(R, L_m)$ model provides an observationally consistent and dynamically viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.",
New submissions,Probing Loop Quantum Gravity black holes through gravitational lensing,"Arun Kumar,Qiang Wu,Tao Zhu,Sushant G. Ghosh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate strong gravitational lensing by a charged loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole obtained through the polymerisation scheme of Borges \textit{et al.} \cite{Borges:2023fog}. These effective geometries replace the Reissner--Nordström singularity with a symmetric transition surface and admit an extremal, cold remnant determined by the minimal area gap in LQG. In turn, we derive the null geodesic equations, investigate the photon effective potential, and obtain expressions for the photon-sphere radius and critical impact parameter. We compute the weak-field deflection angle and Einstein ring size, highlighting the deviations induced by the polymerisation parameter and the Barbero--Immirzi parameter. In the strong-field regime, we compute the strong deflection coefficients $(\bar{a},\bar{b})$ and evaluate the lensing observables $\theta_\infty$, $s$, and $r_{\rm mag}$. Unlike the Reissner--Nordström case, the LQG corrections enhance the deflection angle and increase the angular separation of relativistic images, with deviations growing as the geometry approaches the LQG remnant limit. We further compute the corresponding observables for Sgr~A* and M87*, finding that the quantum-gravity modifications lie within the potential sensitivity of next-generation VLBI facilities. For M87*, the angular separation $s\in(0.05712,0.19123)\,\mu\text{as}$, while it is $s\in(0.07595,0.25426)\,\mu\text{as}$ for Sgr A*. The relative flux ratio is found to lie in the range, $r_{\rm mag}\in(4.49272,5.96397)$. Our analysis demonstrates that LQG-induced corrections leave characteristic strong and weak-lensing imprints, offering a promising observational pathway to probe quantum gravity using near-future high-resolution observations.",
New submissions,"Constraining linear form of $f(\mathcal{R,G,T})$ gravity from astrophysical observations of the Pulsar U1724",G.G.L. Nashed,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we examine the internal structure of compact stars within an extended gravitational framework described by the function $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{T})$. Throughout this work, the quantity $\mathcal{R}$ refers to the curvature scalar formed from the Ricci tensor. The term $\mathcal{G}$ denotes the Gauss--Bonnet curvature invariant, while $\mathcal{T}$ corresponds to the trace obtained by contracting the matter energy-momentum tensor. Our analysis is directed toward massive radio pulsars with masses above $1.8\,M_{\odot}$, which provide an exceptional testing ground for gravity under conditions inaccessible to laboratory experiments. Adopting the linear form $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{T})=\mathcal{R}+\alpha\,\mathcal{G}+\beta\,\mathcal{T}$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters of suitable dimensionality,\footnote{$\alpha$ has dimensions of $[L^{2}]$ and $\beta$ carries units of $[N^{-1}]$.} we obtain an exact analytic solution for static anisotropic stellar matter in hydrostatic equilibrium. This solution allows all physical quantities to be expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameters $ \alpha_{1}=\alpha/R^{2},\qquad \beta_{1}=\beta/\kappa^{2}$ together with the compactness $C=2GM/(Rc^{2})$. We constraint the two parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by matching the model with the mass and radius of pulsar \textit{U1724} requires restricting these parameters to $\alpha_{1}=\pm0.023$ and $\beta_{1}=\pm0.001$, where $\kappa^{2}=8\pi G/c^{4}$ is the standard Einstein coupling. The resulting stellar configuration satisfies the causal bound on the radial sound speed, $c_{s}^{2}<c^{2}/3$, distinguishing it from the corresponding behaviour in general relativity.",
New submissions,Universal scalarization in topological AdS black holes,"Zi-Qiang Zhao,Zhang-Yu Nie,Shao-Wen Wei,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the universal behavior of black hole scalarization induced by a charged scalar field in the extended phase space of the asymptotic AdS spacetime with three distinct horizon topologies. The results indicate that in all the three cases, the charged black hole spacetime undergoes scalarization at low temperatures. Notably, the spherical topology is unique in that its domain of scalarization theoretically extends to much higher temperatures under low pressure in the extended phase space. Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style. This study provides deeper insight into the zeroth-order phase transition during black hole scalarization and reveals the complete phase structure of black holes in the extended phase space.",
New submissions,Primordial black hole driven cosmic acceleration,"Konstantinos Dialektopoulos,Theodoros Papanikolaou,Vasilios Zarikas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) with repulsive behavior, within a ''Swiss Cheese'' cosmological framework. Considering regular black hole spacetimes such as Hayward, Bardeen, and Dymnikova-as well as the singular Schwarzschild-de Sitter case-we consistently find a robust PBH-driven cosmic acceleration phase. This phase ends either at an energy scale set by the PBH parameters or through black hole evaporation. Notably, one finds that ultra-light PBHs with $m < 5 \times 10^8 \, {\rm g}$ can trigger exponential inflation with graceful exit and reheating. Additionally, PBHs with $m \sim 10^{12} \, {\rm g}$ and abundances $0.107 < \Omega_{\rm PBH}^{\rm eq} < 0.5$ near matter-radiation equality can act as an early dark energy component, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.",
New submissions,Hawking-radiation-ignited autocatalytic formation of primordial black holes,Alexander Yakimenko,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS),"We propose and analyze an autocatalytic mechanism in which bursts of Hawking radiation from evaporating micro-primordial black holes (PBHs) trigger the collapse of near-critical plasma overdensities. In a primordial plasma seeded with such patches, this feedback self organizes into a traveling ignition front that successively forms new PBHs and then self-quenches as the Universe expands. A minimal reaction-diffusion model yields conservative criteria for ignition and freeze-out and predicts a stochastic gravitational-wave background with a sharp causal low-frequency edge set by the freeze-out correlation length and largely insensitive to Planck-scale PBH endpoint microphysics. The resulting sub-Hz-to-audio band and amplitudes satisfy cosmological energy-injection bounds, providing a clean, testable target for forthcoming gravitational-wave observatories.",
New submissions,Violations of the Weak Energy Condition for Lentz Warp Drives,"Bill Celmaster,Steve Rubin",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Warp drive spacetimes capable of superluminal transportation, were first introduced in 1994 by Miguel Alcubierre and then generalized by others. These spacetimes violated the Weak Energy Condition (WEC). Lentz proposed a new type of warp drive in 2020. It was claimed that this warp spacetime has non-negative energy density and can therefore be sourced by a classical plasma. We demonstrate that Lentz's claim is incorrect. We begin with a direct calculation of the energy-momentum tensor of Lentz's warp drive in a Eulerian reference frame, and show that there are spacetime regions where the energy density is negative. We then examine the theoretical basis of Lentz's investigation and identify several derivation errors. The derivation errors can be somewhat ameliorated with a modified version of Lentz's geometry, which more closely respects the equalities and inequalities discussed by Lentz. Even so, we show that the modified geometry still violates the WEC even in the Eulerian reference frame. We conclude with a brief discussion of no-go theorems and their relationship to geometries of the kind proposed by Lentz.",
New submissions,Constraint on massive vector field with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals around a slowly rotating black hole,"Tieguang Zi,Peng-Cheng Li,Bao-Min Gu,Fu-Wen Shu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We study the influence of a massive vector (Proca) field on the energy fluxes from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) around a slowly rotating Kerr black hole. The secondary compact object, carrying a Proca hair, emits additional dipolar radiation that alters total energy flux relative to general relativity (GR). These modifications induce a secular drift in the orbital evolution of circular geodesic orbits, leading to measurable dephasing in the resulting EMRIs waveforms. By evaluating waveform mismatches between the Einstein-Proca framework and its GR counterpart, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish the signatures of a light Proca field when black hole rotation is included. Furthermore, using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we forecast LISA's capability to place stringent constraints on the Proca mass with EMRIs signal from slowly rotating Kerr black holes. For representative EMRIs configurations, we find that LISA can detect or constrain Proca masses down to $\mu_v\sim 10^{-20}$eV, with typical fractional uncertainties at the level of tens percent, depending on the black-hole spin.",
New submissions,Energy transfer between the sources in gravitational decoupling,Daulet Berkimbayev,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A straightforward and fully analytic approach is introduced to examine how polytropic fluids influence arbitrary gravitational sources in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. As a concrete application, we explore the internal mechanism of energy transfer between gravitational sources embedded within a self-gravitating system.",
New submissions,Looking through the Kerr disk,"Maciej Maliborski,Tobias C. Sutter",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study null geodesics that connect the two asymptotically flat regions of the maximally extended Kerr spacetime. These vortical geodesics traverse both horizons and pass through the ring singularity, linking the positive-$r$ exterior to the negative-$r$ asymptotic side. Using impact parameters, we identify a closed subset of parameter space, the inner throat, where the radial potential has no real roots, and photons exhibit no radial turning points. In this region, at most two constant-latitude geodesics exist, one of which is aligned with the principal null direction. We also identify the forbidden polar-angle band that limits the range of geodesics reaching an asymptotic observer. We solve the geodesic equations analytically and numerically in Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates, obtaining mutually consistent results that correct and extend previously available formulae. The resulting trajectories are used to construct simulated views for an observer in the negative-$r$ domain, revealing strong image distortion and inversion, with possible implications for analogous white-hole configurations.",
New submissions,Non-Singular Bouncing Cosmology from Hyperbolic Field Space Geometry,Oleksandr Kravchenko,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a two-field cosmological model in a closed ($k=+1$) universe where the field space is endowed with a hyperbolic geometry. We demonstrate that the curvature of the field space introduces a kinetic coupling that exponentially suppresses the scalar field kinetic energy as the fields explore certain regions, allowing the spatial curvature to dominate and trigger a non-singular bounce. Crucially, the model satisfies the Null Energy Condition (NEC) throughout, with the bounce driven entirely by the positive spatial curvature -- not by exotic physics. We derive analytic solutions for the bounce, verify them numerically, and compute observable predictions. The model predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \approx 0.003$--$0.005$ and local non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL} \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, placing it within reach of next-generation CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4. The model is ghost-free by construction.",
New submissions,Dynamical interplay between coupled scalar dark sectors and gravity,Mihai Marciu,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph),"We explore a novel cosmological model based on coupled fields in the framework of scalar tensor theories, considering the specific interplay between gravity and scalar fields. The model further extends a recent axion-dilaton system by introducing viable couplings with the space--time geometry encoded into the scalar curvature. After briefly introducing the action and the corresponding field equations, we employ linear stability theory to investigate the physical properties. The analysis showed the compatibility of the current theoretical model with the recent history of the Universe, obtaining viable constraints for the model's parameters in some specific cases. In the present setup, the axion--dilaton system is non--minimally coupled with gravity in an independent manner, leading to distinct physical features in the phase-space structure, possible alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem.",
New submissions,Off-Equatorial Orbits around Magnetically Charged Black Holes,"Xilai Li,David E. Kaplan,Loris Del Grosso",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a complete characterization of stable, off-equatorial circular orbits around magnetically charged black holes (MBHs). For a static, spherically symmetric MBH, we derive an exact analytic expression for the orbital latitude theta as a function of radius r. We establish a direct connection between these orbits and the spacetime fundamental structure, and demonstrate their stability against synchrotron radiation. We show that charged particles such as electrons and protons can exhibit O(1) latitude deviations at the ISCO radius and remain stable under synchrotron emission even for extremely small values of the black hole magnetic charge. We then extend the analysis to rotating MBHs, numerically computing the prograde and retrograde orbital branches and demonstrating how frame-dragging modifies their structure and stability regions. We show that these off-equatorial orbits are a unique feature of the magnetic charge, being forbidden in the analogous electrically charged Kerr-Newman spacetime. Our results suggest that environments surrounding magnetically charged black holes can exhibit distinctive phenomenological signatures, with potential implications for black hole imaging and polarimetric observations.",
New submissions,"Schrödinger-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity-nonmetricity driven cosmological evolution from inflation to the late Universe","Lei Ming,Himanshu Chaudhary,Shi-Dong Liang,Hong-Hao Zhang,Tiberiu Harko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider an $f(Q, T)$ gravity theory with a Schrödinger type vectorial non-metricity. In the presence of such a non-metricity, the length of vectors is preserved under autoparallel transport. We obtain the field equations assuming a vanishing total scalar curvature, implemented by a Lagrange multiplier, and investigate their cosmological implications. To do this, we derive the generalized Friedmann equations which now have terms involving the non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we consider two distinct cosmological applications of the model. First of all, by adopting distinct forms of these two basic variables and investigate the possibility of the existence of warm inflationary scenarios within the framework of these models. In particular, we consider the case that the non-metricity is described by a constant vector, and we show that with this assumption we recover standard general relativity. The scenario in which the Lagrange multiplier is a constant is also investigated, and we show that radiation can be created during the very early phases of expansion. The amount of radiation peaks at a certain time after which, there is a transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered Schrödinger type cosmology with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, by adopting a simple linear form for the Lagrange density. The model predictions are also compared with the results of the $\Lambda$CDM standard paradigm. Our results indicate that the Schrödinger $f(Q,T)$ type theory can give a good description of the observational data for both the very early and the late Universe.",
New submissions,Black hole binaries in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity experience a slower merger phase,"Maxence Corman,Llibert Aresté Saló,Katy Clough",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, stationary black holes have a non-vanishing scalar charge. During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.",
New submissions,Ghost instabilities and strong coupling in quadratic non-metricity theories,"Alexander Ganz,Marco Spinelli",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We revisit the framework of Newer General Relativity, defined by all independent quadratic invariants of the non-metricity tensor, including the unique quadratic parity-violating term. We analyze linear perturbations around a flat FLRW background and find that the theory generically exhibits ghost instabilities, except for the special case of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) supplemented by the parity-violating operator. Using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, we show that this remaining case propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level. This result implies that the parity-violating extension of STEGR is strongly coupled around FLRW and therefore lies beyond the regime of validity of standard linear perturbation theory.",
New submissions,The Einstein constraints and differential forms,"Andrzej Okolow,Jakub Szymankiewicz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We express the vacuum Einstein constraints in terms of differential forms - the forms include one-forms constituting an orthonormal coframe of the spatial metric. We show that if the metric is real-analytic, then the constraints can be always expressed locally as a system of first order PDE's - this system is obtained by a special choice of the coframe, which reduces to zero all second order terms in the scalar constraint.",
New submissions,Dynamical system analysis of the cosmological phases in Palatini $k$-essence gravity,"Fabio Moretti,Flavio Bombacigno",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We formulate a generalized $k$-essence model in the presence of a Palatini $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravitational sector. In the corresponding biscalar-tensor theory, we discuss the distinguished dynamical properties of the two scalar fields, elucidating how the Palatini scalaron can be still algebraically solved in terms of matter, the $k$-essence field and its kinetic term. We derive the conditions ensuring the absence of Ostrogradsky modes and the well-posedness of the initial data problem, also providing an intriguing analogy with a specific class of DHOST theories. Then, we investigate the cosmology of a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker spacetime according a dynamical system approach, with the aim of determining the set of fixed points in the phase space, representing specific periods of the Universe evolution and characterized by different effective barotropic index $w_{\text{eff}}$. The analysis reveals the presence of a range of possible configurations, with the existence of (quasi) de-Sitter epochs connected by heteroclinic orbits, scaling solutions and quintessence phases.",
New submissions,Spherical Einstein-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin boson stars: Self-interacting solutions and their astrophysical appearance,"Pedro L. Brito de Sá,Haroldo C. D. Lima,Carlos A. R. Herdeiro,Luís C. B. Crispino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate boson stars within the framework of the self-interacting Einstein-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (E-FLS) model, constituted by a complex scalar field with a quartic self-interaction and a real scalar field. Our analysis explores the family of static solutions across a broad range of parameters, including the self-interaction of the complex scalar field. We obtain that positive self-interaction terms increase the maximum mass and compactness of E-FLS stars, allowing them to reach masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar limit without the need of ultralight bosonic masses. Moreover, in the limit where the real scalar field becomes massless, the solutions present larger effective radii and allow a broader range of stable solutions. Astrophysical images, generated via backward ray-tracing, show that these compact, self-interacting E-FLS stars produce strong gravitational lensing, yielding shadows that could visually mimic black holes, thus providing potential observational signatures detectable in ongoing electromagnetic surveys.",
New submissions,Inflation in theories with broken diffeomorphisms,"Antonio L. Maroto,Prado Martín-Moruno,Miguel Orbaneja-Pérez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We analyze the impact of breaking diffeomorphism invariance in the inflaton sector. In particular, we consider inflaton models which are invariant under the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms and address the possibility of implementing a slow-roll phase. We obtain the corresponding expressions for relevant quantities such as the slow-roll parameters and the number of $e$-folds, and derive the primordial power-spectrum of curvature perturbations. The scalar spectral index features modifications which are confronted with CMB data from Planck and ACT. We study in detail the quadratic potential model, combining asymptotic and numerical analysis. We show that the post-inflationary behavior can be drastically different from the diffeomorphism-invariant case, exhibiting novel dynamical regimes.",
Cross submissions,CLAWDIA: A dictionary learning framework for gravitational-wave data analysis,"Miquel Llorens-Monteagudo,Alejandro Torres-Forné,José A. Font",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Deep-learning methods are becoming increasingly important in gravitational-wave data analysis, yet their performance often relies on large training datasets and models whose internal representations are difficult to interpret. Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) offers a complementary approach: it performs well in scarce-data regimes and yields physically interpretable representations of gravitational-wave morphology. Here we present CLAWDIA (Comprehensive Library for the Analysis of Waves via Dictionary-based Algorithms), an open-source Python framework that integrates SDL-based denoising and classification under realistic detector noise. We systematise previously isolated SDL workflows into a unified, modular environment with a consistent, user-friendly interface. The current release provides several time-domain denoising strategies based on LASSO-regularised sparse coding and a classifier based on Low-Rank Shared Dictionary Learning. A companion toolbox, GWADAMA, supports dataset construction and realistic conditioning of real and simulated interferometer data. We demonstrate CLAWDIA's performance by denoising the signal from binary neutron star event GW170817 and by classifying families of instrumental glitches from LIGO's third observing run, highlighting robustness at low signal-to-noise ratios. CLAWDIA is intended as a community-driven, interoperable library extensible to additional tasks, including detection and parameter estimation.",
Cross submissions,Quantum Spacetime: Echoes of basho,Fedele Lizzi,History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"I will discuss how the concept of basho, introduced by Nishida Kitaro nearly a century ago, can give an interesting insight to understand the concept of a point in modern quantum gravity. A quantum spacetime, necessary for the quantization of gravity, requires a whole rethinking of geometry, starting from the primitive concepts, like that of a point. I argue that the local vision of what becomes of classical points in quantum gravity, and in particular in noncommutative geometry, shows several similarities with Nishida's basho.",

Semertzidis,Kristof Schmieden,Mattias Schott,Sergey Uchaikin,SungWoo Youn",High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Monochromatic high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGW) provide a distinctive probe of new physics scenarios, most notably axion clouds around rotating black holes formed via superradiance. We reanalyzed data from the CAPP-12T MC (multi-cell) axion haloscope experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133,051802 (2024)]. The study covers a continuous $2\,$MHz frequency span centered at $5.311\,$GHz. No rescan candidates were found, and we set 90% confidence-level exclusion limits on the gravitational-wave strain, reaching $h_0 \approx 3.9 \times 10^{-21}$ in the most sensitive regions of the sky. Interpreted in the context of black-hole superradiance from axion clouds, the results exclude black holes with mass $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \simeq 1.22 \times 10^{-6}\,M_\odot$ within distances of $O(10^{-2})\,$AU from Earth, under benchmark assumptions. This work demonstrates the potential of electromagnetic resonant cavities as novel detectors of monochromatic HFGW and motivates future searches for both long-lived and transient signals.",
Cross submissions,General relativistic Lagrangian continuum theories -- Part II: electromagnetic fluids and solids with junction conditions,Francçois Gay-Balmaz,Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a covariant variational framework for relativistic electromagnetic continua (fluids and solid) based on Hamilton's principle formulated directly in the material description. The approach extends the geometric theory of relativistic continua introduced in Part I to include polarization, magnetization, and general elastic-electromagnetic coupling through a unified energy functional. By exploiting spacetime and material covariance, the framework yields the corresponding spacetime and convective variational principles, together with transparent expressions for the stress-energy-momentum tensor and the covariant Euler-type balance equations governing nonlinear electromagnetic continua. Coupling to general relativity is naturally incorporated, and when the action is augmented with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms, the gravitational and electromagnetic junction conditions follow directly from the variational formulation. The results provide a coherent foundation for modeling nonlinear electromagnetic continua in relativistic regimes, with relevance to astrophysical systems where relativistic continuum dynamics and electromagnetic fields are known to be strongly coupled, such as neutron-star crusts, magnetar flares, relativistic jets, and accretion disks. We also offer systematic connections with several formulations appearing in the existing literature.",
Cross submissions,Black Hole Spin Estimation with Time-variable Image of M87 During the Flaring State,"Mikiya M. Takahashi,Tomohisa Kawashima,Ken Ohsuga",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"By investigating the time-variable 230 GHz images using ray-tracing general relativistic radiative transfer calculation, we propose a novel method for estimating the spin parameter of the supermassive black hole at the M87 center by utilizing the sudden and short-term increase in emissivity in the innermost region of the accretion disk. It is found that the flux of the photon ring increases simultaneously as the flux of the direct ring, which brightens first, decreases, and then gradually diminishes, when the increase in emissivity persists for $15 t_{\rm g}$ with $t_{\rm g}$ being the light crossing time of the gravitational radius. The direct ring is formed by photons emitted from the vicinity of the innermost region of the disk and traveling directly to the observer without orbiting around the black hole, while the photon ring is formed by photons passing near the spherical photon orbit. The time-averaged width of the dark region between the direct ring and the photon ring (dark crescent) becomes thinner when the spin parameter is higher and the increase in the emissivity of the accretion disk is greater. The time variation of two rings also causes the intensity-weighted center to oscillate both in the direction of the black hole's angular momentum vector projected onto the screen ($Y$-direction) and in the perpendicular direction ($X$-direction). The amplitude of oscillatory time variation in the $X$-direction becomes large when the spin parameter is higher, and that in the $Y$-direction becomes large when the increase in the emissivity of the disk is large. The spin parameter can be estimated by combining the time-averaged dark crescent width and the ratio of the amplitudes in the $X$- and $Y$-directions. This method is applicable when the duration of the increase in emissivity of the accretion disk ranges at least from approximately 10-20 $t_{\rm g}$.",
Cross submissions,From LIGO to Fiber- Compact Sagnac Interferometer for Gravitational-Wave Detection,"Farhad Hakimi,Hosain Hakimi",Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational wave detection has transformed astrophysics, granting us direct access to black hole mergers, neutron star collisions, and the cataclysms of stellar death. Yet the great observatories of today, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the planned Einstein Telescope, rest on Michelson interferometers that, despite their triumphs, confront fundamental barriers of scale, cost, and environmental vulnerability. We envision a new path, a Sagnac-based fiber interferometer that leverages reciprocity and inherent robustness. Its meter-scale, modular design compact enough to fit within a small facility, offers dramatic gains in scalability and affordability over kilometer scale Michelson systems. Tunable to frequency bands where conventional detectors lose sensitivity, it opens the door to compact, versatile, and accessible GW observatories, empowering universities and research centers worldwide. Linked together in a global network, such facilities could transcend mere detection, they could localize cosmic sources and reconstruct them into images, much as black holes were first directly revealed, ushering in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy and multi-messenger discovery.",
Cross submissions,New Near Extremal Black Holes and Love Symmetry,"Alfredo Guevara,Uri Kol",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Rotating and charged black holes are known to exhibit remarkable properties close to extremality, including emergent hidden symmetries and holographic duality to 2D theories. In this note, we introduce a new class of near-extremal black holes living in $(2,2)$ signature, strongly resembling the Lorentzian ones but with an exact integrable structure $SL(2,\mathbb{R})\times SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. The exterior of the black hole is a self-dual solution with a photon ring. It develops an infinite near-horizon throat described by the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. An exact version of the so-called Love symmetry controls perturbations on the throat. Furthermore, the normalizable spectrum of this black hole provides quasinormal modes in Lorentzian signature.",
Cross submissions,How Complex is Dark Energy? A Bayesian Analysis of CPL Extensions with Recent DESI BAO Measurements,"Mohammad Malekjani,Saeed Pourojaghi,Zahra Davari",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The nature of dark energy is one of the big puzzling issues in cosmology. While $\Lambda$CDM provides a good fit to the observational data, evolving dark energy scenarios, such as the CPL parametrization, offer a compelling alternative. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model comparison of various dark energy parametrizations using a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background data, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and the PantheonPlus (or Union3) Supernovae type Ia sample. We find that while the $\Lambda$CDM model is initially favored over a constant $w$CDM model, the CPL parametrization is significantly preferred over $w$CDM, reinforcing recent evidence for an evolving dark energy component, consistent with DESI collaboration findings. Crucially, when testing higher-order CPL extensions, the so-called CPL$^+$ and CPL$^{++}$, our Bayesian analysis shows that the observational data do not favor these more complex scenarios compared to the standard CPL. This result indicates that adding excessive complexity to the CPL form is unwarranted by current observations. Interestingly, similar to the CPL parametrization, alternative two-parameter forms, specifically $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_b(1-a)^2$ and $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_c(1-a)^3$, yield a better fit to observational data than the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results challenge the necessity for overly complex CPL extensions and confirm that well-chosen two-parameter $w_0w_a$ parametrizations effectively capture DE evolution with current cosmological data, supporting the recent signals for dynamical dark energy by DESI collaboration.",
Cross submissions,Tracing the Trace Anomaly of Dense Matter inside Neutron Stars,"Shiyue Ren,Lap-Ming Lin",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"The trace anomaly $\Delta$ is an important quantity that measures the broken conformal symmetry in neutron star matter. In this work, we present quasi-universal relations that connect the stellar profile of $\Delta$ to the compactness, moment of inertia, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. We apply the quasi-universal relations to determine the trace anomaly profiles for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 based on their mass-radius measurements. We also analyze PSR J0737-3039A according to its moment of inertia inferred from Bayesian modeling of nuclear equation of state. A recent multimessenger constraint on the tidal deformability is also studied, resulting in an estimate value of the trace anomaly $\Delta_c = 0.1770^{+0.0365}_{-0.0432}$ at the center of a $1.4M_\odot$ canonical neutron star. It is expected that more precise observations from both electromagnetic and gravitational-wave channels in the future will provide tighter constraints on the behavior of $\Delta$ inside neutron stars.",
Cross submissions,Separating the Inseparable: Constraining Arbitrary Primordial Bispectra with Cosmic Microwave Background Data,"Oliver H. E. Philcox,Kunhao Zhong,Salvatore Samuele Sirletti",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"To efficiently probe primordial non-Gaussianity using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, we require theoretical predictions that are factorizable, \textit{i.e.}\ those whose kinematic dependence can be separated. This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $>99.5\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1\sigma$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data.",
Cross submissions,Noncritical Conformal Gravity and Four-Dimensional Liouville Theory,"Hikaru Kawai,Nobuyoshi Ohta",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the quantum aspects of the conformal gravity in four dimensions, specifically addressing a known discrepancy in beta functions between general quadratic curvature theories and conformal gravity, which corresponds to two scalar degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that this mismatch is resolved by carefully introducing gauge-fixing and ghost terms via the BRST symmetry, which effectively adds the two scalar modes. Drawing lessons from two-dimensional quantum gravity and Liouville theory, we proceed to integrate the four-dimensional trace anomaly to derive a consistent Liouville action, which is given by a free-field action for the conformal mode with a consistent conformal anomaly. Finally we give the condition that the BRST transformation is anomaly free.",
Cross submissions,"SL(2N,C) Hyperunification: Dynamical Tetrads, Induced Gravity, and Composite Families",J. L. Chkareuli,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We develop a four-dimensional hyperunified gauge framework in which local Lorentz symmetry and internal gauge interactions are embedded into a special noncompact $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ group acting on spinors. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is shown to arise radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale only the neutral tetrad (graviton) and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. Applying the same $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ symmetry to underlying preons in fundamental spin-$\tfrac12$ representations, rather than directly to quarks and leptons, together with the anomaly matching for the preon chiral symmetry, singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.",
Cross submissions,A demonstration that classical gravity does not produce entanglement,"Mike D. Schneider,Nick Huggett,Niels Linnemann",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph),"Once again, dispute has arisen over the interpretation of proposed quantum information theory experiments to probe the quantum nature of gravity by testing for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two spatially separated massive particles ([1] vs. [11,12]; further contributions in [7,9]). The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement on independent grounds. A Newton-Cartan analysis shows that if gravity is classical, a mediator, and entanglement is observed as an outcome of performing a GIE experiment, something other than gravity must have supplied the (virtual) force needed during the experiment to produce the effect.",
Cross submissions,Neural surrogates for designing gravitational wave detectors,"Carlos Ruiz-Gonzalez,Sören Arlt,Sebastian Lehner,Arturs Berzins,Yehonathan Drori,Rana X Adhikari,Johannes Brandstetter,Mario Krenn",Machine Learning (cs.LG); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.",
Cross submissions,Constraining strongly-warped extra dimensions with rotating black holes,"Bruno Valeixo Bento,Miquel Salicrú Herberg",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Massive bosonic fields can trigger superradiant instabilities in rotating astrophysical black holes leading to gaps in their mass-spin distribution. For spin-2 fields, the instability timescale is orders of magnitude shorter than for any other superradiant mode, thereby yielding much stronger constraints. We consider a tower of ultra-light spin-2 fields arising from a warped compactification of a single extra dimension and translate superradiant constraints on their masses into constraints on the warping. As a concrete scenario we consider the 2-brane Randall-Sundrum model and find constraints on the size of the extra dimension and the curvature of $AdS_5$. We discuss the implications of these bounds for strongly warped throats and D-brane uplifts commonly used in attempts to realise metastable de Sitter vacua in string theory.",

Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by <10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events.",
