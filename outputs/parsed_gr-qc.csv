New submissions,Effective Pressure of the FRW Universe,Shi-Bei Kong,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by $P_{eff}:=-dE/dV$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$, and in this case, the effective pressure is not always negative and has a minimum. The effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.",
New submissions,Accelerating Expansion of the Universe in modified gravity with quadratic terms,Aaqid Bhat,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Chapter1 introduces cosmic acceleration and outlines key features and limitations of GR and its alternatives, including teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel gravity. In Chapter2, we analyze the cosmological implications of $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ theory by considering the squared-torsion model $f(T,\mathcal{T})= \alpha \mathcal{T}+ \beta T^2$, where $T$ represents torsion and $\mathcal{T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In Chapter3, we explore the inflationary scenario within the framework of torsion-trace coupling gravity, utilizing a Lagrangian density derived from a function denoted as $f(T,\mathcal{T})$. In Chapter4, we aim to investigate the dark sector of the Universe, which encompasses the enigmatic components of the Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). We consider an extended form of the Equation of State (EoS) for DM, widely known as the Extended Bose-Einstein Condensation (EBEC) EoS for DM. In Chapter5, we propose an extended formulation of symmetric teleparallel gravity by generalizing the gravitational Lagrangian through the inclusion of an arbitrary function of $f(Q,\mathcal{T_{\mu\nu}} \mathcal{T^{\mu\nu}})$. We derived the FRW equations for a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime. In Chapter6, we delved into the dark sector of the Universe, specifically focusing on DM and DE. We examine an extended version of the EoS for DM, commonly referred to EBEC EoS for DM, given as $p=\alpha \rho + \beta \rho^2$, alongside the modified $f(Q)$ Lagrangian given by $f(Q)= \gamma Q^2$.",
New submissions,Black Hole Entropy Bounded by the Specific Heat,"Kai-Peng Lu,H. Lu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We propose new bounds on black hole entropy in terms of the specific heat at fixed charges. For special spherically-symmetric and static black holes ($g_{tt} g_{rr}=-1$), we prove the bounds with suitable sufficient energy conditions. For more general static and rotating black holes, we test the bounds with a variety of examples. This work extends the previously-known algebraic inequalities of the black hole thermodynamic variables such as the Penrose inequality, to include their derivatives.",
New submissions,Hyperbolic Casimir-like wormhole,"Roberto Avalos,Ernesto Contreras,Daniel Brito,Ernesto Fuenmayor",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a systematic study of exact solutions for traversable wormhole geometries in a static and hyperbolic symmetric spacetime. In the conventional form of studying wormhole geometry, traversability requires the presence of exotic matter, which also provides negative gravity effects to keep the wormhole throat open. Using hyperbolic symmetry we obtain a solution already provided with negative energy density that replaces this effect and allows us to derive wormhole geometries that effectively violate the null energy condition. To achieve this goal, we use a generalized complexity factor for hyperbolic symmetry adapted to study wormhole geometries and with a suitable redshift function in order to construct a Casimir-like traversable hyperbolic wormhole. A detailed study has been conducted on the behavior of the matter sector, the energy conditions, and the traversability conditions.",
New submissions,Updated constraints on modified gravity from binary pulsars,"S. Bussieres,M. Caldarola,S. Nesseris",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Binary pulsars offer a unique natural laboratory to test General Relativity (GR) and probe for deviations from its paradigm, as predicted by alternative theories of gravity. In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a time variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar gravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars, namely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the Keplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital dynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian parameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do this via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python pipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different binary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and the dipolar emission parameter $\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars (PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{-12}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint on the dipolar emission parameter, $\kappa_D = (-0.04 \pm 0.14) \times 10^{-4}$. Thanks to the recent high-precision timing data sets, we provide updated bounds on key parameters relevant to modified gravity theories, and we find that our results are consistent with GR.",
New submissions,Primordial black hole formation in matter domination,"Ehsan Ebrahimian,Ali Akbar Abolhasani,Mehrdad Mirbabayi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed by the collapse of rare primordial fluctuations during an early period of Matter Domination. The collapse threshold strongly depends on the shape of the peaks, decreasing as they become flatter and hence rarer. In the extreme limit of a top-hat perturbation, Harada, Kohri, Sasaki, Terada, and Yoo have argued that the growth of velocity dispersion prevents the formation of black holes unless the initial peak is larger than $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{2/5}$. Including the shape distribution of the peaks, we find that for a realistic cosmic abundance of PBHs, the effective threshold is larger, $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms }^{1/10}$. And this model requires $\zeta_{\rm rms}\sim 10^{-1}$, which is much larger than the observed value at the CMB scales. Hence, PBH formation during Matter Domination is barely more efficient than Radiation Domination. We estimate the dimensionless spin parameter to be $a_{\rm rms} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{7/4}\ll 1$, slightly larger than PBHs formed in Radiation Domination.",
New submissions,New models of nonsingular black hole dark matter from limiting curvature,"Selin Aşmanoğlu,Jens Boos,Christopher D. Carone",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We consider phenomenological models for nonsingular black hole that satisfy the limiting curvature condition (i.e., that have curvatures that are always sub-Planckian in size) while having a more general dependence on the black hole mass than the most studied examples. These models allow black holes to exist while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands""), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.",
New submissions,Effective Dynamics of Spherically Symmetric Static Spacetime,"Etera R. Livine,Yuki Yokokura",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In general relativity, the Einstein equations provide spherically symmetric static spacetimes with dynamics defined as an evolution along the radial coordinate $r$. The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical system, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate variables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or quantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general relativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to non-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism through various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians describing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with linear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians that reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to renormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the singularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free black-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning from a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside Schwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both semi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure of self-gravitating compact objects and black holes.",
New submissions,Topological dark energy from spacetime foam: A challenge for $Λ$CDM,"Fotios K. Anagnostopoulos,Stylianos A. Tsilioukas,Emmanuel N. Saridakis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Using only the standard considerations of spacetime foam and the Euclidean Quantum Gravity techniques known long ago, we result to a model of Topological Dark Energy (TDE) that outperforms the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm with regard to data fitting efficiency. Specifically, it is known that at the foam level, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the particular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective dynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the latter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can immediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of the topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this TDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic evolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We confront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with Pantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model selection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but statistically significant preference over $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Finally, we show that the TDE scenario passes constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and thus does not spoil the thermal history of the Universe.",
New submissions,Correlation and Redundancy of Time-Delay Interferometry Configurations,Gang Wang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) is essential for space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions, as it suppresses laser frequency noise and achieve the required sensitivity. Beyond the standard Michelson configuration, a variety of second-generation TDI schemes have been proposed, each utilizing different combinations of inter-spacecraft laser links. In this work, we conduct a comparative study of several representative TDI configurations with varying time spans and demonstrate that their (quasi-)orthogonal channels are highly correlated, indicating substantial redundancy among these schemes. In the low-frequency regime, the performance of different TDI configurations are nearly identical. Their distinctions emerge primarily at high frequencies, where the GW wavelength becomes comparable to the arm length. In this regime, shorter TDI time spans with minimal null frequencies facilitate more accurate waveform modeling and parameter recovery in frequency domain. In contrast, configurations with longer time spans and more null frequencies, such as the Michelson, are more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation effects, which degrade inference accuracy. However, if signal modeling and analysis are performed in the time domain, all TDI configurations become effectively equivalent. Considering the usability in both frequency and time domain, the short-span PD4L scheme, which exhibits minimal nulls and superior performance in high frequencies, emerges as a promising candidate for future space-based GW mission designs.",
New submissions,Stability of Big Bang singularity for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system in the full strong sub-critical regime,"Xinliang An,Taoran He,Dawei Shen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In $3+1$ dimensions, we study the stability of Kasner solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system. This system incorporates gravity, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions for the initial stage of our universe. Due to the presence of the Vlasov field, various new challenges arise. By observing detailed mathematical structures and designing new delicate arguments, we identify a new strong sub-critical regime and prove the nonlinear stability with Kasner exponents lying in this full regime. This extends the result of Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck [8] from the Einstein-scalar field system to the physically more complex system with the Vlasov field.",
New submissions,Searching for Gravitational Waves with Gaia and its Cross-Correlation with PTA: Absolute vs Relative Astrometry,"Massimo Vaglio,Mikel Falxa,Giorgio Mentasti,Arianna I. Renzini,Adrien Kuntz,Enrico Barausse,Carlo Contaldi,Alberto Sesana",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Astrometric missions like Gaia provide exceptionally precise measurements of stellar positions and proper motions. Gravitational waves traveling between the observer and distant stars can induce small, correlated shifts in these apparent positions, a phenomenon known as astrometric deflection. The precision and scale of astrometric datasets make them well-suited for searching for a stochastic gravitational wave background, whose signature appears in the two-point correlation function of the deflection field across the sky. Although Gaia achieves high accuracy in measuring angular separations in its focal plane, systematic uncertainties in the satellite's absolute orientation limit the precision of absolute position measurements. These orientation errors can be mitigated by focusing on relative angles between star pairs, which effectively cancel out common-mode orientation noise. In this work, we compute the astrometric response and the overlap reduction functions for this relative astrometry approach, correcting previous expressions presented in the literature. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to compare the sensitivity of relative astrometry to that of conventional absolute astrometry. Our analysis shows that while the relative method is theoretically sound, its sensitivity is limited for closely spaced star pairs within a single Gaia field of view. Pairs with large angular separations could provide competitive sensitivity, but are practically inaccessible due to Gaia's scanning law. Finally, we demonstrate that combining astrometric data with observations from pulsar timing arrays leads to slight improvements in sensitivity at frequencies greater than approximately 10^-7 Hz.",
Cross submissions,Not-quite-primordial black holes seeded by cosmic string loops,Bryce Cyr,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Cosmic strings appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ at high redshifts. Interestingly, for reasonable values of the string parameters, one can reproduce the abundance of ``Little Red Dots"" as inferred by JWST.",
Cross submissions,Collapsar Disk Outflows III: Detectable Neutrino and Gravitational Wave Signatures,"Rodrigo Fernández,Silas Janke,Coleman Dean,Irene Tamborra",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.",
Cross submissions,Page Curve for an Evaporating Schwarzschild Black Hole in Dimensionally-Reduced Model of Dilaton Gravity,"Stefan Đorđević,Voja Radovanović",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study entanglement entropy of quantum fields in a (1+1)-dimensional model of dilaton gravity derived from the four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action by dimensional reduction. Scalar matter is coupled to gravity, while the back-reaction is included via the Polyakov-Liouville action. This theory exhibits both eternal and evaporating Schwarzschild black hole solutions. The fine-grained entropy in a collapse scenario is investigated by applying the ""island rule"" via the quantum extremal surface approach. We demonstrate that the fine-grained entropy of the Hawking radiation follows the Page curve, and therefore the evolution of the Hawking radiation is unitary.",
Cross submissions,On Supersymmetric D-brane probes in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $\text{AdS}_2\times\mathbf{S}^2$ Attractors,"Alberto Castellano,Carmine Montella,Matteo Zatti",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We extend the $\kappa$-symmetry analysis of supersymmetric D-brane probes in the $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathbf{S}^2$ attractor geometry, originally performed by Simons, Strominger, Thompson, and Yin, to also include stationary -- but non-static -- worldlines carrying angular momentum along the 2-sphere. We demonstrate that certain special trajectories, with fixed radius and orbital velocity, solve the equations of motion and moreover satisfy a supersymmetry preserving condition, thus defining new $\frac12$-BPS configurations. Furthermore, these classical paths are shown to saturate a lower bound for the Hamiltonian generating global time translations, with the corresponding minimal energy depending on a generalized angular momentum vector $\boldsymbol{J}$. The direction of the latter, in turn, determines exactly which supercharges remain unbroken. Our results reveal a richer spectrum of (multi-particle) supersymmetric states in $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathbf{S}^2$, which can be organized into distinct selection sectors labeled by the conserved $SU(2)$ charges. This construction has direct applications in black hole microstate counting, the analysis of probe dynamics and $\text{AdS}_2/\text{CFT}_1$ holography.",
Cross submissions,Matter Spectral Functions from Quantum Gravity,"Varun Kher,Brandon King,Daniel F. Litim,Manuel Reichert",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate Lorentzian quantum gravity coupled to a template matter sector with gauge fields, scalars and fermions. In the absence of quantised gravity, the matter sector by itself is renormalisable, but UV-incomplete. Provided quantum gravity offers an asymptotically safe UV-completion, we determine the photon and scalar two-point functions in the presence of gravitational fluctuations, and show that both possess a Källén-Lehmann spectral representation. Our results are achieved using functional renormalisation adapted for theories in Lorentzian signature. We explain why and how interactions with gravity modify both the infrared as well as the ultraviolet behaviour of matter spectral functions. We further determine the corresponding form factors on the level of the quantum effective action. Limitations and extensions of our study are discussed alongside implications for particle physics and unitarity of quantum gravity with matter.",
Cross submissions,Phantom crossing or dark interaction?,"Sêcloka L. Guedezounme,Bikash R. Dinda,Roy Maartens",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent results from DESI BAO measurements, together with Planck CMB and Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\rm de}<-1$) in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$ is used to fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but effective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$. The energy flows from dark matter to dark energy at early times and reverses at later times.",
Cross submissions,Quark and lepton mixing in the asymptotically safe Standard Model,"Astrid Eichhorn,Zois Gyftopoulos,Aaron Held",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The quark mixing (CKM) matrix is near-diagonal, whereas the lepton mixing (PMNS) matrix is not. We learn that both observations can generically be explained within an ultraviolet completion of the Standard Model with gravity. We find that certain relations between CKM matrix elements should hold approximately because of asymptotically safe regimes, including $|V_{ud}|^2+|V_{us}|^2 \approx 1$ and $|V_{cd}|^2+|V_{cs}|^2\approx 1$. Theoretically, the accuracies of these relations determine the length of the asymptotically safe regimes. Experimental data confirms these relations with an accuracy of $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively. This difference in accuracies is also expected, because the ultraviolet completion consists in a fixed-point cascade during which one relation is established already much deeper in the ultraviolet. This results in $|V_{ub}|^2 < |V_{cb}|^2$ and translates into measurable properties of $B$-mesons.Similar results would hold for the PMNS matrix, if neutrino Yukawa couplings were large. The ultraviolet complete theory therefore must -- and in fact can -- avoid such an outcome. It contains a mechanism that dynamically limits the size of neutrino Yukawa couplings. Below an upper bound on the sum of Dirac neutrino masses, this allows the PMNS matrix to avoid a near-diagonal structure like the CKM matrix. Thus, large neutrino mixing is intimately tied to small Dirac neutrino masses, $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim {\mathcal{O}} (1)\, \rm eV$ and a mass gap in the Standard Model fermion masses.",
Cross submissions,κ-deformed spin-1/2 field,"Tadeusz Adach,Andrea Bevilacqua,Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman,Giacomo Rosati,Wojciech Wiślicki",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate the $\kappa$-deformed theory of a spin-1/2 field. We construct an action that is Poincaré invariant and analyze its consequences within the deformed framework. Our results confirm the findings of our recent analysis of the $\kappa$-deformed scalar field, where we established that there is no action invariant under both Poincaré symmetry and charge conjugation in the $\kappa$-deformed case. Furthermore, we present an explicit calculation of the Noether charges associated with Poincaré symmetry and show that their algebra closes, demonstrating the internal consistency of the theory.",
Cross submissions,Surface growth scheme for bulk reconstruction and $T\bar T$ deformation,"Hao-Chun Liang,Jia-Rui Sun,Yuan Sun",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we study the dynamical connection between the surface growth scheme and the conformal field theory with $T\bar{T}$ deformation. By utilizing the extended one-shot entanglement distillation tensor network, we find that the iterative growth, i.e. radial evolution of homogenous and isotropic bulk minimal surfaces in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime can be mapped to the $T\bar{T}$ operator flow driven by the deformation parameter. Our results show that the $T\bar{T}$ deformation can provide a dynamical mechanism for the surface growth in asymptotically AdS spacetime, which may shed light on reconstructing bulk gravitational dynamics from the surface growth scheme.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational pulsars: correlations between the electromagnetic and the continuous gravitational wave signal,"Marco Antonelli,Avishek Basu,Brynmor Haskell",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Neutron stars emitting continuous gravitational waves may be regarded as gravitational pulsars, in the sense that it could be possible to track the evolution of their rotational period with long-baseline observations of next-generation gravitational wave interferometers. Assuming that the pulsar's electromagnetic signal is tracked and allows us to monitor the pulsar's spin evolution, we provide a physical interpretation of the possible observed correlation between this timing solution and its gravitational counterpart, if the system is also detected in gravitational waves. In particular, we show that next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, could have the sensitivity to discern different models for the coupling between the superfluid and normal components of the neutron star and constrain the origin of timing noise (whether due to magnetospheric or internal processes). Observational confirmation of one of the proposed scenarios would therefore provide valuable information on the physics of gravitational wave emission from pulsars.",
Cross submissions,Emergent-gravity Hall effect from quantum geometry,"Hiroki Yoshida,Takehito Yokoyama",Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We theoretically propose a Hall effect driven by effective gravitational fields arising from quantum geometry. We develop four mechanisms for this ''emergent-gravity Hall effect"" : real-space gravity, momentum-space gravity, gravitional anomalous velocity, and gravitational Lorentz force which are described by the Christoffel symbols in real, momentum, and time spaces. We construct a unified theoretical framework to systematically investigate the effects of emergent gravity in these spaces on transport phenomena based on the semiclassical theory. We demonstrate these effects by model calculations and clarify the conditions under which a finite Hall response can arise. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring gravitational effects in quantum systems.",
Cross submissions,Monte Carlo studies of the emergent spacetime in the polarized IKKT model,"Chien-Yu Chou,Jun Nishimura,Cheng-Tsung Wang",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The IKKT matrix model has been investigated as a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. One of the recent developments concerning this model is the discovery of the dual supergravity solution corresponding to the model obtained after supersymmetry-preserving mass deformation, which is dubbed the polarized IKKT model. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of this model in the case of matrix size N = 2 for a wide range of the deformation parameter Omega. While we reproduce precisely the known result for the partition function obtained by the localization method developed for supersymmetric theories, we also calculate the observables, which were not accessible by previous work, in order to probe the spacetime structure emergent from the dominant matrix configurations. In particular, we find that the saddle point corresponding to the original IKKT model is smoothly connected to the saddle represented by the fuzzy sphere dominant at large Omega, whereas the dominant configurations become diverging commuting matrices at small Omega.",
Cross submissions,A continuity equation compatible basis for Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy,"Federico Armato,Edoardo Martinelli,Marco Raveri",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Effective Field Theory (EFT) of Dark Energy (DE) is a model independent framework that allows for the description of a wide class of dark energy and modified gravity models. This is achieved by extending the Hilbert Einstein action through the introduction of time dependent functions. However, the choice of these functions and thus the operator basis is not unique. In this paper, we propose a physically motivated constraint based on the continuity equation, leading to a continuity equation compatible (CEC) basis that ensures a clear physical interpretation of the background EFT operators.",
Cross submissions,Graviton scattering on self-dual black holes,"Tim Adamo,Giuseppe Bogna,Lionel Mason,Atul Sharma",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The computation of gravitational wave scattering on black hole spacetimes is an extremely hard problem, typically requiring approximation schemes which either treat the black hole perturbatively or are only amenable to numerical techniques. In this paper, we consider linearised gravitational waves (or gravitons) scattering on the self-dual analogue of a black hole: namely, the self-dual Taub-NUT metric. Using the hidden integrability of the self-dual sector, we can solve the linearised Einstein equations on these self-dual black hole backgrounds exactly in terms of simple, explicit quasi-momentum eigenstates. Using a description of the self-dual Taub-NUT metric and its gravitons in terms of twistor theory, we obtain an explicit formula, exact in the background, for the tree-level maximal helicity violating graviton scattering amplitude at arbitrary multiplicity, with and without spin. This is obtained from the description of the MHV amplitudes in terms of the perturbation theory of a chiral sigma model whose target is the twistor space of the background. The incorporation of spin effects on these backgrounds is a straightforward application of the Newman-Janis shift. We also demonstrate that the holomorphic collinear splitting functions in the self-dual background are equal to those in flat space so that the celestial symmetry algebra is undeformed.",
