New submissions,Quantum-Corrected Deformation of RN-AdS Black Holes with a Cloud of Strings Immersed in Quintessential-like Fluid,"Faizuddin Ahmed,Abdelmalek Bouzenada",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), we investigate the Reissner-Nordström (RN) black hole (BH) solution coupled with a cloud of strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background, surrounded by a quintessence-like fluid. We begin by analyzing the optical properties of the BH through null geodesic motion, deriving an effective potential that governs photon dynamics. This effective potential is central to understanding key phenomena such as photon trajectories, circular null orbits, photon sphere, and the resulting BH shadow. Subsequently, we study the dynamics of neutral test particles by deriving effective potential that describes their motion. Using the potential, we compute the specific energy and specific angular momentum of neutral particles in circular orbits around the BH and analyze the outcomes. We also investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and demonstrate how various geometrical and physical properties influence the radius of ISCO. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic properties of the BH solution by deriving key quantities such as the Hawking temperature, entropy, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat capacity. Throughout the study, we demonstrate that the geodesic structure, scalar field behavior, and thermodynamic properties are significantly influenced by parameters such as the string cloud, quantum correction, electric charge, the surrounding quintessence-like fluid, and the AdS curvature radius.",
New submissions,Primordial Black Hole Formation and Spin in Matter Domination Revisited,"Weitao Ye,Yungui Gong,Tomohiro Harada,Zhaofeng Kang,Kazunori Kohri,Daiki Saito,Chul-Moon Yoo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this article, we calculate the mass distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the matter-dominated (MD) era by the peak theory. We apply the Zel'dovich approximation to track the nonlinear evolution of overdensities and compute the PBH abundance and mass function by incorporating a PBH formation criterion based on the hoop conjecture. We find that the PBH abundance $\beta$ follows the scaling law $\beta \simeq A_\gamma \sigma_h^{*5}$ for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$. Here, $\sigma_h^*$ is the quantity that characterizes the variance of the density fluctuation at the horizon entry. We also find that, in contrast to the previous estimates, the PBH spin is very small for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$ but could be larger for larger $\sigma_h^*$ and broader power spectra. Finally, specializing to a monochromatic power spectrum, we prove analytically that the PBH mass distribution becomes effectively monochromatic and reveal that the resultant PBH abundance is approximately 19 times the previous prediction.",
New submissions,Scalar and vector modes in inflation with antisymmetric tensor field,"Abhijith Ajith,Sukanta Panda",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the scalar and vector modes arising from cosmological perturbations within the framework of an inflationary scenario driven by an antisymmetric tensor field, minimally coupled to gravity. After eliminating gauge artifacts, there remain four scalar and six vector modes of interest which can be studied separately. We analyze the stability of these modes, while looking for generic instabilities like ghost and gradient instabilities that could potentially plague the theory. Further, we investigate the evolution of these modes across different regimes, particularly subhorizon and superhorizon scales.",
New submissions,Stochastic Quantization of Electrodynamics and Linearized Gravity,"Partha Nandi,Partha Ghose",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We develop a unified stochastic framework in which a velocity- and helicity-reversing Poisson process gives rise to the Telegrapher's equation. Analytic continuation to the complex plane results in Dirac-like evolution equations for electromagnetic and linearized gravitational fields. A small but nonzero mass parameter is essential to enable helicity reversals. Yet, the correct massless wave equations are recovered as the physically relevant massless limit is approached smoothly, with the singular point excluded from the construction. Remarkably, probability does not enter as an external postulate as in the Born rule in standard quantum mechanics -- but is intrinsic to the stochastic process. This probabilistic structure becomes embedded in the wave fields through a natural rescaling by the Planck length.",
New submissions,Precession of spherical orbits for the spacetime without $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry induced by NUT charge,"Xiang-Cheng Meng,Shan-Ping Wu,Shao-Wen Wei",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Astrophysical evidence has hinted at the existence of a nonzero NUT charge, which breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of spacetime and induces novel features in geodesics. In this work, we investigate the Lense-Thirring precession of the spherical orbits in the Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime, with particular emphasis on its connection to recent observations of black hole jet precession. We analyze the reflection symmetry breaking in trajectories of the spherical orbits and extract their precession angular velocity. It is worth noting that in the absence of spin, the spherical orbits reduce to tilted circular orbits without precession, whereas for nonzero spin, the precession angular velocity increases with the absolute value of the NUT charge. We then model the motion of particles near the warp radius of a tilted accretion disk using the spherical orbits and constrain the black hole parameter space based on the observed jet precession of M87*. The results indicate that regions with low spin and large NUT charge were excluded, and that the jet precession measurements cannot distinguish the sign of the NUT charge. The excluded region is larger for retrograde accretion disks than for prograde ones. We also find that this observation do not allow a clear distinction between black holes and naked singularities. Moreover, we also explore how black hole parameters influence the structure of accretion disk. These results have important theoretical and astronomical significance for us to deeply understand NUT space-time.",
New submissions,Revisiting the maximum mass limit of strange stars in higher-order curvature-matter coupled gravity,"Debadri Bhattacharjee,Pradip Kumar Chattopadhyay",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore the maximum mass limit of strange stars within the framework of modified gravity described by $f(\tilde{R},T)=R+\alpha R^{2}+2\beta T$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ characterise the contributions from higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry, respectively. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the modified field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Our results show that, for suitable choices of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and bag parameter $(B_{g})$, the maximum mass limit of strange stars exceeds their general relativistic counterpart. Specifically, our model yields a maximum mass up to $3.11~M_{\odot}$, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could plausibly be a strange star within this theoretical framework.",
New submissions,'Stealth' singularities from self-gravitating fermions,"Peter E. D. Leith,Chris A. Hooley,Keith Horne,David G. Dritschel",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a new analytic solution to the Einstein-Dirac equations formulated by Finster, Smoller, and Yau [Phys. Rev. D 59, 104020 (1999)] to describe the stationary states of a pair of gravitationally interacting neutral fermions. The fermions' wavefunction in our analytic solution, as in their numerical ones, is both exponentially localized and normalizable. However, our solution differs from theirs in two key respects: it features a naked spacetime singularity at the origin, and the gravitational (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) mass of the localized object is zero, making it gravitationally undetectable to an external observer. This is despite the arbitrarily large mass of the constituent fermions. This unexpected result may have significant implications for astronomy and cosmology, as it gives a mechanism by which mass could become 'hidden' during the universe's evolution.",
New submissions,Compact Binary Coalescence Sensitivity Estimates with Injection Campaigns during the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' Fourth Observing Run,"Reed Essick,Michael W. Coughlin,Michael Zevin,Deep Chatterjee,Teagan A. Clarke,Utkarsh Mali,Simona Miller,Nathan Steinle,Pratyusava Baral,Amanda C. Baylor,Gareth Cabourn Davies,Thomas Dent,Prathamesh Joshi,Praveen Kumar,Cody Messick,Tanmaya Mishra,Amazigh Ouzriat,Khun Sang Phukon,Lorenzo Piccari,Marion Pillas,Max Trevor,Thomas A. Callister,Maya Fishbach",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We describe the effort to characterize gravitational-wave searches and detector sensitivity to different types of compact binary coalescences during the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' fourth observing run. We discuss the design requirements and example use cases for this data product, constructed from $> 4.33\times10^8$ injections during O4a alone. We also identify subtle effects with high confidence, like diurnal duty cycles within detectors. This paper accompanies a public data release of the curated injection set, and the appendixes give detailed examples of how to use the publicly available data.",
New submissions,Unraveling the Hubble tension with warm inflation,"Anupama B,P K Suresh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The validity of warm inflation is investigated in the light of recent CMB missions in both strong and weak dissipative regimes. The tensor to scalar ratio of various inflationary models is found to be consistent with the recent CMB results for different models of warm inflation. The role of dissipation on the popular models of warm inflation in the context of supersymmetry and string theory is investigated. Further, the effect of dissipation coefficient of warm inflation on the Hubble parameter and its role in accounting the Hubble tension is examined. Warm inflation embodies superstring theory and can provide a platform to test quantum gravity in multi field scenario.",
Cross submissions,Effects of light-mass fermionic dark matter on the equilibrium and stability of white dwarfs,"G.A. Carvalho,J.D.V. Arbañil,J.G. Coelho",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"White dwarfs (WDs) can be used as laboratories to test strong gravity and high-density regimes, once their equation of state is not so uncertain as the one of neutron stars. This makes them also a useful tool to constrain dark-matter models. In this work, we study dark matter white dwarfs (DMWD) composed of white dwarf matter admixed with fermionic dark matter in a two-fluid general relativistic framework. Dark matter particles are considered to have masses between $0.1-10$ GeV. The equilibrium configurations and stability are derived, showing that the DMWD can be more compact, with masses around 1.3 $M\odot$ and radii around 500 km. The increasing compactness leads to changes in the fundamental modes of radial oscillations ($\sim20\%$ for 0.1 GeV DM), which produce detectable shifts in GW frequencies. The interplay between dark matter and normal matter thus provides a compelling avenue for interpreting deviations in observed WD properties and for placing constraints on DM characteristics through astrophysical observations.",
Cross submissions,Can stellar physics explain GW231123?,"Djuna Croon,Jeremy Sakstein,Davide Gerosa",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17} M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52} M_\odot $ -- well within or above the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160 \rm M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing a significant ingredient that correlates masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap, implying that stellar evolution alone is sufficient to explain GW231123. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.",
Cross submissions,De Sitter Complexity Grows Linearly in the Static Patch,"Vyshnav Mohan,Watse Sybesma",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The observable universe has undergone periods of expansion that are well approximated by de Sitter (dS) space. Still lacking is a quantum mechanical description of dS, both globally and when restricted to the static patch. We develop a novel prescription for computing holographic complexity in the dS static patch to determine its microscopic features. Specifically, we propose that the natural candidate for dS complexity is the volume of extremal timelike surfaces restricted to the static patch, anchored to the cosmological horizon or an observer worldline. Our anchoring prescription provides a clear definition of a reference state, overcoming a common ambiguity in prior definitions of de Sitter holographic complexity. The late-time growth of our complexity functional is linear and proportional to the number of degrees of freedom associated to the cosmological horizon, and therefore does not exhibit hyperfast growth. Our results imply the dS static patch is characterized by a quantum mechanical system, with a finite dimensional Hilbert space whose evolution is governed by a chaotic Hamiltonian.",
Cross submissions,Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data,"Himanshu Chaudhary,Salvatore Capozziello,Vipin Kumar Sharma,Isidro Gómez-Vargas,G. Mustafa",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift, and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0>-1$, $\omega_a<0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a<-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.",
Cross submissions,Parity violation in framework of nonmetricity gravity,"Zhiyuan Yu,Zhengsheng Yang,Taotao Qiu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way.",
Cross submissions,On frequentist confidence intervals in a non-Gaussian regime,"Shubham Barua,Shantanu Desai,Mauricio Lopez-Hernandez,Eoin Ó Colgáin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We study frequentist confidence intervals based on graphical profile likelihoods (Wilks' theorem, likelihood integration), and the Feldman-Cousins (FC) prescription, a generalisation of the Neyman belt construction, in a setting with non-Gaussian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors. Our simplified setting allows us to recycle the MCMC chain as an input in all methods, including mock simulations underlying the FC approach. We find all methods agree to within $10 \%$ in the close to Gaussian regime, but extending methods beyond their regime of validity leads to greater discrepancies. Importantly, we recover a $\sim 2 \sigma$ shift in cosmological parameters between low and high redshift cosmic chronometer data with the FC method, but only when one fits all parameters back to the mocks. We observe that fixing parameters, a common approach in the literature, risks underestimating confidence intervals.",
Cross submissions,Time-Dependent Deflection Reconstruction: A New Technique to Search for Gravitational Waves with the Cosmic Microwave Background,"Alvin Leluc,Joel Meyers,Alexander van Engelen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be applied to surveys at other wavelengths.",
Cross submissions,Investigating the Impact of Higher-Order Phase Transitions in Binary Neutron-Star Mergers,"P. Hammond,A. Clevinger,M. Albino,V. Dexheimer,S. Bernuzzi,C. Brown,W. Cook,B. Daszuta,J. Fields,E. Grundy,C. Providência,D. Radice,A. Steiner",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"In this paper we investigate quark deconfinement in neutrons stars and their mergers, focusing on the effects of higher orders for the phase transition between hadronic and quark matter. The different descriptions we use to describe matter microscopically contain varying particle degrees of freedom, including nucleons, hyperons, Delta baryons, and light and strange quarks. We use tabulated equations of state from the CompOSE database in which the quark deconfinement phase transition is described as being first-order, and then smooth it out by introducing a percolation, replacing the single first-order phase transition with two transitions of second or third order. We then perform binary neutron-star merger simulations using these new equations of st ate, focusing on groups of binaries with the same single-star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, but different equations of state. We go on to discuss differences in their evolution, and the ramifications for interpreting future gravitational wave observations and the potential to learn about dense matter.",
Cross submissions,Unexpected Symmetries of Kerr Black Hole Scattering,"Dogan Akpinar,Graham R. Brown,Riccardo Gonzo,Mao Zeng",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Motivated by the recent introduction of the Dirac bracket framework to compute spinning observables for the scattering of Kerr black holes, we initiate the study of conserved quantities from an on-shell amplitude perspective. We establish new results for the conservation of energy, angular momentum, the Rüdiger invariant and the quadrupolar Carter constant using the spinning radial action extracted from the literature both in the probe limit and beyond, up to third post-Minkowskian order in the conservative sector. Furthermore, we offer a new perspective on the spin-shift symmetry of the radial action, clarifying its role in the dynamics. Finally, we define a new on-shell notion of asymptotic integrability in the Liouville sense and present strong evidence that it is surprisingly satisfied by a spinning probe in Kerr up to quartic order in the probe spin, to all orders in the post-Minkowskian expansion. We further establish integrability beyond the probe limit at low PM orders. Our results suggest important new implications for the dynamics of Kerr black holes.",
Cross submissions,Scalar-induced gravitational waves with non-Gaussianity up to all orders,"Xiang-Xi Zeng,Zhuan Ning,Rong-Gen Cai,Shao-Jiang Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are ubiquitous in many early-Universe processes accompanied by non-Gaussianity; hence, precise calculations of SIGWs involve a full understanding of non-Gaussianity. In this Letter, we propose to use the lattice simulations to directly calculate the energy density spectra of SIGWs with non-Gaussianity up to all orders. Our proposal has been first verified to match the existing semi-analytical results with non-Gaussianity, and then applied to more general cases, including high-order primordial non-Gaussianities, the logarithmic dependence in curvature perturbations, the curvaton model, and the ultra slow-roll model. We find that even a modest non-Gaussianity can significantly alter ultraviolet behaviors in SIGW spectra, necessitating special cautions in future detections as well as mutual constraints on/from primordial black holes.",
