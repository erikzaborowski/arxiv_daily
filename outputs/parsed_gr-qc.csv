New submissions,Relativistic compact stars coupled with dark energy in Heintzmann spacetime,"Susmita Sarkar,Nayan Sarkar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The literature suggests that dark energy is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe due to its negative pressure, therefore, dark energy can be used as a possible option to prevent the gravitational collapse of compact objects into singularities. In this regard, there is a great possibility that dark energy can interact with the compact stellar matter configuration [Phys. Rev. D 103, 084042 (2021)]. In this article, we introduce a physically viable model for celestial compact stars made of isotropic baryonic matter and isotropic dark energy with Heintzmann's ansatz [Zeitschrift für Physik 228, 489-493 (1969)] in the context of Einstein's gravity. Here, the density of dark energy is assumed to be proportional to the density of baryonic matter. The main focus of the present article is to see the effects of dark energy on the physical properties of the stars. We perform an in-depth analysis of the physical attributes of the model, such as metric function, density, pressure, mass-radius relation, compactness parameter, gravitational and surface redshifts, along with the energy conditions for three well-known compact stars. We analyse the equilibrium of the present model via the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the stability with the help of the adiabatic index and Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov's static stability condition. Moreover, we estimate the solutions representing the maximum masses and the predicted surface radii from the M-R graph for different values of the coupling parameter {\alpha}. All the analyses ensure that the present model is non-singular and physically viable by satisfying all the essential conditions.",
New submissions,The fundamental physical importance of generic off-diagonal solutions and Grigori Perelman entropy in the Einstein gravity theory,"Sergiu I. Vacaru,Elşen V. Veliev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The gravitational field equations in general relativity (GR) consist of a sophisticated system of nonlinear partial differential equations. Solving such equations in some generic off-diagonal forms is usually a hard analytic or numeric task. Physically important solutions in GR were constructed using a diagonal ansatz for metrics with a maximum of 4 independent coefficients. The Einstein equations can be solved in exact or parametric forms determined by some integration constants for corresponding assumptions on spherical or cylindrical spacetime symmetries. The anholonomic frame and connection deformation method allows us to construct generic off-diagonal solutions described by 6 independent coefficients of metrics depending, in general, on all spacetime coordinates. New types of exact and parametric solutions are determined by generating and integration functions and (effective) generating sources. They may describe vacuum gravitational and matter fields solitonic hierarchies; locally anisotropic polarizations of physical constants for black holes, wormholes, black toruses, or cosmological solutions; various types of off-diagonal deformations of horizons, etc. The additional degrees of freedom (related to off-diagonal coefficients) can be used to describe dark energy and dark matter configurations and elaborate locally anisotropic cosmological scenarios. In general, the generic off-diagonal solutions do not involve certain hypersurface or holographic configurations and can't be described in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking thermodynamic paradigm. We argue that generalizing the concept of G. Perelman's entropy for relativistic Ricci flows allows us to define and compute geometric thermodynamic variables for all possible classes of solutions in GR.",
New submissions,Probing phase transitions and microscopic interactions in quasi-topological black holes,"Apurba Tiwari,Randeep Kaur,Aruri Devaraju,Jaya Prakash Kode,Apparao Damarasingu,Silamanthula Hari Krishna,Akshay Gharat",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we examine the thermodynamic geometry of four-dimensional quasi-topological black holes by computing the Ruppeiner scalar curvature R which serves as an empirical tool to describe the nature of interactions among black hole microstructures. In four dimensions, we write novel black hole solutions within the framework of generalized quasi-topological gravity, extended through a fundamental p-form field. Temperature, entropy, and thermodynamic volume are explicitly expressed using the extended first law. The nature of the interactions between the microstructure is then revealed by computing R, where positive curvature indicates repulsion dominant interactions and negative curvature indicates the dominance of attraction. Our approach uses divergences and sign changing nature of R to identify critical points and phase transitions. Further, our analysis reveals a notably streamlined thermodynamic behavior, a single zero-crossing of curvature R, marking a second-order phase transition and offering direct insight into the underlying microstructure interactions.",
New submissions,Quantum-Corrected Thermodynamics and Plasma Lensing in Non-Minimally Coupled Symmetric Teleparallel Black Holes,"Erdem Sucu,İzzet Sakallı,Özcan Sert,Yusuf Sucu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the thermodynamic and optical signatures of electrically charged black holes (BHs) in symmetric teleparallel gravity (STPG) with non-minimal electromagnetic coupling, incorporating quantum corrections and plasma dispersion effects. The BH solution, characterized by a coupling parameter $k$, generalizes the Reissner-Nordström spacetime through power-law modifications to electromagnetic terms in the metric function. We implement exponential corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the form $S = S_0 + e^{-S_0}$ and derive quantum-corrected expressions for fundamental thermodynamic quantities including internal energy, Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies, pressure, enthalpy, and heat capacity. Our analysis reveals rich phase transition structures with second-order transitions occurring at critical horizon radii for specific coupling values, demonstrating enhanced thermodynamic instability under strong non-minimal coupling effects. The quantum-corrected Joule-Thomson expansion analysis identifies distinct cooling and heating regimes separated by inversion points that shift systematically with the coupling parameter $k$. We analyze the efficiency of heat engines operating in Carnot cycles, finding that electromagnetic charge enhances thermodynamic performance with efficiency values approaching 99\% for optimal configurations in this geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we derive analytical expressions for gravitational deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, revealing how non-minimal coupling and plasma dispersion create frequency-dependent lensing signatures that differ substantially from general relativity predictions.",
New submissions,Inference with finite time series II: the window strikes back,"Colm Talbot,Sylvia Biscoveanu,Aaron Zimmerman,Tomasz Baka,Will M. Farr,Jacob Golomb,Charlie Hoy,Andrew Lundgren,Jacopo Tissino,Michael J. Williams,John Veitch,Aditya Vijaykumar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Smooth window functions are often applied to strain data when inferring the parameters describing the astrophysical sources of gravitational-wave transients. Within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, it is conventional to include a term to account for power loss due to this window in the likelihood function. We show that the inclusion of this factor leads to biased inference. The simplest solution to this, omitting the factor, leads to unbiased posteriors and Bayes factor estimates provided the window does not suppress the signal for signal-to-noise ratios $\lesssim O(100)$, but unreliable estimates of the absolute likelihood. Instead, we propose a multi-stage method that yields consistent estimates for the absolute likelihood in addition to unbiased posterior distributions and Bayes factors for signal-to-noise ratios $\lesssim O(1000)$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the commonly held wisdom that using rectangular windows necessarily leads to biased inference is incorrect.",
New submissions,Echoes and quasinormal modes of asymmetric black bounces,"Alana C. L. Santos,Leandro A. Lessa,Roberto V. Maluf,Gonzalo J. Olmo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study quasinormal modes and echoes of symmetric and asymmetric black bounce solutions generated by anisotropic fluids within the framework of general relativity. We derive the effective potential governing massless scalar fields and compute the corresponding quasinormal mode spectra using three independent methods: sixth-order WKB, Pöschl-Teller and time-domain evolution. Our results show that symmetric black bounce configurations with horizons yield a standard single-barrier potential, while horizonless solutions may exhibit multiple potential barriers that generate gravitational wave echoes. These echoes are sensitive to model parameters such as the fluid energy density and the regularizing parameter $a$ that defines the minimal $2$-sphere. The asymmetric models considered recover the Reissner-Nordström solution in their external region but can be bounded or unbounded in the inside, depending on the sign of a parameter. Both cases have similar qualitative properties as far as wave emission is concerned but show no echoes. This makes it very difficult to distinguish them from standard Reissner-Nordström configurations.",
New submissions,Theoretical Detailed Analyses for DC readout and a Fabri-Pérot gravitational-wave detector,Kouji Nakamura,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"The quantum expectation value and the stationary noise spectral density for a Fabri-Pérot gravitational-wave detector with a DC readout scheme are discussed in detail only through the quantum electrodynamics of lasers and the Heisenberg equations of mirrors' motion. We demonstrate that the initial conditions of the mirrors' motion concentrate around the fundamental frequency of the pendulum and are not related to the frequency range of our interest. Although in the ideal case, there is a consensus that the shot noise for the laser in the high-frequency range in the signal-referred noise spectral density decreases if the injected laser power is increased, our obtained noise spectral density shows that the shot noise does not decrease even if the injected laser power is increased. This is due to the leakage of the classical radiation pressure forces from the classical carrier field to the output port, and the classical carrier field is used as the reference in the DC readout scheme. Since the classical radiation pressure forces affect the mirror motion as a classical constant force, this classical constant force changes the equilibrium point of the pendulum of mirrors' motion. To recover the ideal case, we must consider adjusting the interferometer's tuning point to place the mirrors in equilibrium points. We investigate the case where the equilibrium tuning is incomplete and show that the behavior of the above shot noise is due to this incompleteness. We also discuss the maximal deviation of the mirror displacements from the equilibrium point in the incomplete tuning to recover the near ideal case.",
New submissions,Einstein's Equations in Electromagnetic Media,"Eren Erberk Erkul,Ulf Leonhardt",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, Plebanski's 1960 mapping is extended to encode the full Einstein system in an electromagnetic medium. This is achieved by identifying transformation parameters in terms of the ADM constraint and evolution equations, and subsequently applying the mapping to the entire system. These transformed equations are then linearized in vacuum to derive gravitational-wave analogues as perturbations within the optical medium.",
New submissions,ACT inflation and its influence on reheating era in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,"Sergei D. Odintsov,Tanmoy Paul",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the observational viability of non-minimally coupled scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity, during inflation and post-inflationary reheating dynamics, from the perspective of the latest ACT-DR6 combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO data. It turns out that the ACT result considerably affects the inflationary e-fold number compared to the case where only Planck 2018 data is taken into account. The viable parameter spaces corresponding to the inflationary ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO substantially influence the reheating phenomenology via the reheating equation of state ($w_\mathrm{eff}$) and the reheating temperature. In particular, the ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO data seems to disfavor $w_\mathrm{eff} < 1/3$ during the reheating stage, which is unlike to that of only Planck 2018 case. These reveal how the ACT-DR6 data hits the early universe phenomenology from inflation to reheating in the context of higher curvature like scalar-Einstein-GB theory of gravity.",
New submissions,Assessing the stability of ultracompact spinning boson stars with nonlinear evolutions,"Tamara Evstafyeva,Nils Siemonsen,William E. East",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We reinvestigate the stability properties of ultracompact spinning boson stars with a stable light ring using fully nonlinear 3+1 and 2+1 numerical relativity simulations and two different formulations of the Einstein equations. We find no evidence of an instability on timescales of $t \mu \sim 10^4$ (in units of the scalar mass), when allowing the star to be perturbed either solely by discretization error or by imposing various types of perturbations to our initial data. We find that the initially imposed perturbations exhibit slow decay, even for magnitudes just below the order where immediate collapse is induced.",
New submissions,Quest for particles production in the plane gravitational wave spacetime,Nail Khusnutdinov,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Massless vector and scalar Green's functions are obtained in closed form for a plane gravitational wave spacetime using three independent methods: direct solution of the Green-function equation and construction via the DeWitt and Hadamard recursive schemes. The results coincide exactly with the DeWitt--Schwinger expansion, indicating no massless particles production in this background. Contrasting interpretations, based on Bogolyubov coefficient calculations predicting massless particle creation, are also addressed.",

Yelikar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) is a next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) facility on the Moon. By harnessing the Moon's unique environment, LILA fills a critical observational gap in the mid-band GW spectrum ($0.1 - 10$ Hz) between terrestrial detectors (LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA) and the future space mission LISA. Observations enabled by LILA will fundamentally transform multi-messenger astrophysics and GW probes of fundamental physics. LILA will measure the lunar deep interior better than any existing planetary seismic instruments. The LILA mission is designed for phased development aligned with capabilities of the U.S.'s Commercial Lunar Payload Services and Artemis programs. LILA is a unique collaboration between universities, space industries, U.S. government laboratories, and international partners.",
Cross submissions,Inflationary Models with Gauss-Bonnet Coupling in Light of ACT Observations,"Yigan Zhu,Qing Gao,Yungui Gong,Zhu Yi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent analyses combining Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data with other cosmological datasets report a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, creating tension with a wide range of inflationary models. Since a Gauss-Bonnet term with a coupling function $\xi(\phi) = 3\lambda/[4V(\phi)]$ leaves $n_s$ nearly unchanged (up to a field rescaling) while reducing the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by a factor $(1-\lambda)$, so choosing $(1-\lambda)$ sufficiently small effectively removes $r$ as a limiting observable, making it easier for inflationary models to satisfy the latest observational constraints and alleviating this tension. Applying this mechanism to chaotic inflation, E-models, T-models, and hilltop inflation, we find that broad regions of parameter space become consistent with the latest ACT-based CMB constraints. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet couplings can help bring a broad class of inflationary models into agreement with current CMB measurements.",
Cross submissions,Unification of Gravity and Standard Model: Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action,D. M. Ghilencea,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We construct a unified (quantum) description by the gauge principle of gravity and Standard Model (SM), that extends the Dirac-Born-Infeld action to the SM and Weyl geometry in $d$ dimensions, hereafter called Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action (WDBI). This action is a general gauge theory of SM and Weyl group (of dilatations and Poincaré symmetry), in the Weyl gauge covariant (metric) formulation of Weyl geometry. The theory is SM and Weyl gauge invariant in arbitrary $d$ dimensions, hence there is no Weyl anomaly. The action has the unique elegant feature, not present in other gauge theories or even in string theory, that it is mathematically well-defined in $d$ dimensions, with no need to introduce a UV regulator (scale or field). The WDBI action actually {\it predicts} that gravity, through (Weyl covariant) space-time curvature, acts as UV regulator of both SM and gravity in $d=4$. A series expansion of the WDBI action (in dimensionless couplings) recovers in the leading order the Weyl gauge invariant action of SM and Weyl (gauge theory of) quadratic gravity. The SM and Einstein-Hilbert gravity are recovered in the Stueckelberg broken phase of Weyl gauge symmetry, which also restores Riemannian geometry below Planck scale. Sub-leading orders are suppressed by powers of (dimensionless) gravitational coupling ($\xi$) of Weyl quadratic gravity.",
Cross submissions,Towards high-precision inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers in numerical relativity,Kenta Kiuchi,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We report the performance of a newly implemented fourth-order accurate finite-volume HLLC Riemann solver in the adaptive-mesh-refinement numerical relativity code {\tt SACRA-MPI}. First, we validate our implementation in one-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics tests, i.e., a simple wave and shock tube test, which have analytic solutions. We demonstrate that the fourth-order convergence is achieved for the smooth flow, which cannot be achieved in our original second-order accurate finite-volume Riemann solver. We also show that our new solver is robust for the strong shock wave emergence problem. Second, we validate the implementation in a dynamical spacetime by demonstrating that {\tt SACRA-MPI} perfectly preserves the $\pi$-symmetry without imposing the $\pi$-symmetry in a short-term ($\sim 20~{\rm ms}$ in the inspiral and subsequent post-merger phase) non-spinning equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulations. Finally, we quantify the accuracy of $\approx 28$ cycles inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers by conducting a resolution study with $\approx 78, 94$, $118$, and $135$ m. We find that the fourth-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.1\pm{0.05}$--$2.4\pm{0.27}$, i.e., slightly evolving with time, in the inspiral gravitational wave phase, while the second-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.0\pm{0.5}$. The residual phase error towards the continuum limit at the merger is $0.27\pm 0.07$ rad and $0.58\pm 0.22$ rad out of a total phase of $\approx 176$ rad, respectively, for the fourth- and second-order accurate Riemann solver.",
Cross submissions,The On-shell Gravity Action and Linear Dilaton Holography,"Andrea Dei,Kiarash Naderi,Savdeep Sethi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),Computing the Euclidean spacetime action on-shell provides a useful way of both testing holographic proposals and determining the string theory sphere partition function. We consider families of three-dimensional linear dilaton spacetimes for which there are holographic proposals that share features of a $T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT. We extend the holographic renormalization program beyond AdS to this class of geometries by identifying the boundary terms needed for a well-defined variational principle and a finite on-shell action. We show that the spacetime energy or mass determined from the on-shell action matches the $T\overline{T}$-deformed two-dimensional CFT energy. This provides more evidence for the role of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation in this holographic correspondence.,
Cross submissions,"Probes for String-Inspired Foam, Lorentz, and CPT Violations in Astrophysics","Chengyi Li,Bo-Qiang Ma",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Lorentz invariance is such a basic principle in fundamental physics that it must be constantly tested and that any proposal of its violation and breakdown of CPT symmetry, that might characterize some approaches to quantum gravity, should be treated with care. In this review we examine, among other scenarios, such instances in supercritical~(Liouville) string theory, particularly in some brane models for ``quantum foam''. Using the phenomenological formalism introduced here, we analyze the observational hints of Lorentz violation in time-of-flight lags of cosmic photons and neutrinos which fit excellently stringy space-time foam scenarios. We further demonstrate how stringent constraints from other astrophysical data, including the recent first detections of multi-TeV events in $\gamma$-ray burst 221009A and PeV cosmic photons by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO), are satisfied in this context. Such models thus provide a unified framework for all currently observed phenomenologies of space-time symmetry breaking at Planckian scales.",
Cross submissions,Extra-natural production of superheavy Kaluza-Klein particles,Yusuke Yamada,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Gauge fields in extra compact dimensions can drive inflation in the four-dimensional (4D) non-compact spacetime, a scenario known as extra-natural inflation. A time-dependent gauge field configuration generates the electric field along the compact dimension, enabling the production of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles charged under the field via the Schwinger effect. We construct the extra-natural inflation model within a five-dimensional (5D) quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework coupled to gravity including matter fields that generate the inflationary one-loop effective potential. In general, multiple charged fields can exist, and we show that KK particle production occurs under these conditions. Since KK momentum is conserved, the produced KK particles may become superheavy dark matter or dominate the universe, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we show that even when the gauge field acts not as the inflaton but as a spectator field, its post-inflationary oscillations, initiated when the Hubble friction becomes negligible, can also generate superheavy KK modes. This suggests that KK particle production is a generic outcome when gauge potentials along compact dimensions are light.",
Cross submissions,Cut-off scale of quantum gravity,"Asya Aynbund,V.V. Kiselev",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Dynamics of gravity interaction with matter at one-loop level of effective quantum field theory naturally sets the cut-off scale $\Lambda_E$ in a sub-Planckian region through incorporating the gauge coupling constant $\alpha(\Lambda_E)$ and the reduced Planckian mass $\tilde m_\text{pl}$ into relation $ \Lambda_E\sim \tilde m_\text{pl}\,\alpha(\Lambda_E)/(4\pi)$ numerically yielding $\Lambda_E\sim 10^{16}$ GeV. Such two scales are empirically inherent for an inflationary cosmology.",
Cross submissions,Demonstrating the velocity response of a table-top EPR Speedmeter,"S.L. Kranzhoff,S.L. Danilishin,S. Steinlechner,M. Vardaro,T. Zhang,S. Hild",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"The sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers is fundamentally limited by quantum noise, as dictated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, due to their continuous position measurement of the end mirrors. Speedmeter configurations, which measure mirror velocity rather than position, have been proposed as a means to suppress quantum back-action noise, but practical implementations remain at an early stage. In this work, we present a table-top realisation of the Einstein- Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Speedmeter concept, employing an optical readout scheme based on two orthogonal polarisation modes that probe the interferometer with different effective bandwidths. Using a triangular cavity, we demonstrate that the differential optical response between the linear p- and s-polarised modes exhibits a speed-like frequency dependence: vanishing at DC and increasing linearly with signal frequency, up to the bandwidth of the slower mode. With this we show that an optical system equivalent to the EPR Speedmeter indeed performs a velocity readout of the end mirror.",
Cross submissions,$T\bar{T}$ braneworld holography,"Shinji Hirano,Vinayak Raj",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study a constructive gravitational dual of two-dimensional $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs) grounded in their two-dimensional gravity description. This framework can be viewed as a Randall-Sundrum-type braneworld, where two-dimensional gravity localized on the $AdS_3$ boundary is dynamical. Assuming the AdS/CFT correspondence, the holographic dictionary provides a straightforward translation between the $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT and its gravitational dual. In particular, this $T\bar{T}$ braneworld holography remains valid in the presence of matter. To clarify how our framework relates to -- and differs from -- the cutoff AdS proposal, we examine, in the absence of matter, the effect of dynamical boundary gravity on the bulk geometry. In general, semiclassical integration of the boundary two-dimensional gravity -- weighted by the massive gravity action -- leads to a deformation of the two-dimensional metric on constant-radial surfaces. However, we find that the surface commonly interpreted as the cutoff emerges dynamically as a characteristic bulk surface on which the deformation is neutralized. This perspective opens the door to possible extensions of our framework to incorporate matter effects on the bulk surface in future work.",
Cross submissions,Surpassing Carnot efficiency with relativistic motion,"Dimitris Moustos,Obinna Abah",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Relativistic thermal devices offer a unique platform for understanding the interplay between motion, quantum fields, and thermodynamics, revealing phenomena inaccessible to stationary systems. We consider a two-qubit SWAP heat engine whose working medium consists of inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors, each coupled to a scalar quantum field in thermal equilibrium at a distinct temperature. Relativistic motion causes the qubits to perceive frequency-dependent effective temperatures that are either hotter or colder than their respective reservoir temperature. We show that the relativistic temperature shift, perhaps the qubit velocity, can be harnessed as a thermodynamic resource to enhance the work output and the efficiency at maximum power of the heat engine. We derive a generalized second law for a heat engine with a moving working medium and demonstrate that it can exceed the standard Carnot bound defined by rest-frame temperatures.",
Cross submissions,Kinematic flow from the flow of cuts,"Ross Glew,Andrzej Pokraka",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"The wavefunction coefficients of conformally coupled scalars in power-law FRW cosmologies satisfy differential equations governed by a set of simple combinatorial rules known as the kinematic flow. In this paper we derive the kinematic flow, expressed using a set of differential forms referred to as the cut basis, from a geometric perspective, relying solely on the cosmological hyperplane arrangement and without invoking bulk physics. Each element of the cut basis corresponds to the positive geometry associated to an independent cut of the physical FRW-form and can be labeled by decorating (minors of) the truncated Feynman graph with an acyclic orientation. We provide a straightforward prescription to associate a logarithmic differential form to each element of the cut basis by considering its corresponding decorated graph. Moreover, we show that the residues of the physical FRW-form are canonical forms of certain graphical zonotopes labeled by the same set of decorated graphs. These zonotopes control the cut combinatorics -- flow of cuts -- of the physical FRW-form and the cut basis (by construction). Using the theory of relative twisted cohomology and intersection theory, we derive a closed form formula for the differential equations of the cut basis. We also introduce combinatorial rules that compute the kinematic differential of any basis element without explicit calculation. The combinatorics of our differential equations is a natural consequence of the flow of cuts and is equivalent (up to rescaling) to the kinematic flow for the recently studied time integral basis. In particular, our differential equations decouple into exponentially many sectors, one for each way of cutting a subset of edges of the graph.",
Cross submissions,Breaking the Strings: the signatures of Cosmic String Loop Fragmentation,Pierre Auclair,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the impact of fragmentation on the cosmic string loop number density, using an approach inspired by the three-scale model and a Boltzmann equation. We build a new formulation designed to be more amenable to numerical resolution and present two complementary numerical methods to obtain the full loop distribution including the effect of fragmentation and gravitational radiation. We show that fragmentation generically predicts a decay of the loop number density on large scales and a deviation from a pure power-law. We expect fragmentation to be crucial for the calibration of loop distribution models.",
Cross submissions,Bulk viscous cosmological models with cosmological constant: Observational constraints,"R. Noemí Villalobos,Yerko Vásquez,Norman Cruz,Carlos H. López-Caraballo",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate whether viscous cold dark matter (vCDM) in a $\Lambda$-dominated FLRW universe can alleviate the Hubble tension while satisfying thermodynamic constraints, examining both flat and curved geometries. We model vCDM with bulk viscosity $\zeta = \zeta_0\,(\Omega_{vc}/\Omega_{vc0})^m$, where $m$ determines the viscosity evolution and $\Omega_{vc}$ is the density parameter of vCDM. We explore two particular scenarios: constant viscosity ($m=0$), and variable viscosity ($m$ free). Using Bayesian inference, we constrain these models with the latest datasets: the Pantheon+ SN Ia sample (both with SH0ES calibration, PPS, and without it, PP), $H(z)$ measurements from CC and BAO as separate datasets, and a Gaussian prior on $H_0$ from 2022 SH0ES baseline, $H_0=73.04 \pm 1.04$ km/s/Mpc (R22 prior). We compare the models via information criteria such as AIC, BIC, DIC, and Bayesian evidence. Our results reveal that the Hubble tension persists, although it shows partial alleviation ($\sim 1\sigma$ tension) in all investigated scenarios when local measurements are included. For the flat $m=0$ case, the joint analysis yields $H_0 = 71.05^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ km/s/Mpc. Curved model initially favors $\Omega_{K0} > 0$ (at more than $2\sigma$), but this preference shifts toward flatness once the PPS+R22 prior are included. Notably, the current viscosity is constrained to $\zeta_0 \sim 10^6$ Pa s in all scenarios, in agreement with the thermodynamic requirements. Although model selection via BIC and Bayesian evidence favors $\Lambda$CDM, AIC and DIC show mild support for viscous models in some datasets. Bulk viscous models moderately improve fits but neither resolve the Hubble tension nor outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. To achieve more robust constraints, future analyses should incorporate CMB observations, which are expected to break parameter degeneracies involving $m$ and $\tilde{\zeta}_0$.",
