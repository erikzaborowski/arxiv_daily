New submissions,Observational Constraints on a Spinor Field Generalized Chaplygin Gas Model in a Spherically Symmetric FLRW Spacetime,"Mahendra Goray,Bijan Saha",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Despite the remarkable success of the standard LambdaCDM model in describing the evolution of the universe, several unresolved issues remain, such as the true nature of dark energy, fine-tuning problems, and the persistent Hubble tension. Motivated by these shortcomings, we construct a spinor field-based Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model that unifies dark matter and dark energy within a spherically symmetric Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. This framework incorporates a nonlinear spinor field and considers an open universe geometry. We constrain the model parameters using the latest observational datasets, including Type Ia supernovae from the binned Pantheon compilation, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC) and SDSS, including baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques, we obtain best-fit values that indicate the spinor GCG model provides a competitive and viable alternative to the LambdaCDM, particularly in the late-time universe. Furthermore, the model predicts a lower present-day Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. The results highlight the rich phenomenology of spinor fields and their possible role in the dynamics of dark energy through spacetime interaction.",
New submissions,Bianchi-I cosmology with scale dependent $G$ and $Λ$ in asymptotically safe gravity,"Chiang-Mei Chen,Akihiro Ishibashi,Rituparna Mandal,Nobuyoshi Ohta",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study anisotropic Bianchi-I (BI) cosmology, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections into the Einstein equation through the scale-dependent Newton coupling and cosmological term, as determined by the flow equation of the effective action for gravity. For the cosmological term $\Lambda_0=0$, we derive the quantum-corrected power-series solution for a general equation-of-state parameter $w$ in the range $-1<w\leq 1$ in the form of expansions in both inverse cosmic time and the anisotropy parameter. We give a general criterion, valid for any $\Lambda_0$, if the solution becomes isotropic in the late time, which indicates that the universe becomes isotropic for most cases of $-1<w<1$ except $w=1$. By numerical analysis, we show that quantum corrections lead to earlier isotropization compared to the classical case starting from an initially highly anisotropic state. In contrast, for $\Lambda_0 >0$, we obtain the inverse power-series solution in the exponential of the cosmic time. We find that the universe always becomes isotropic in the late time, in accordance with the cosmic no hair theorem, and the quantum corrections make the isotropization faster. We also briefly summarize the Kasner solution and its generalization with quantum corrections.",
New submissions,Gravitational lensing by Lema\^ıtre-Tolman-Bondi wormholes in a Friedmann universe,"Kirill A. Bronnikov,Valeria A. Ishkaeva,Sergey V. Sushkov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Lema\^ıtre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solution to the Einstein equations describes the dynamics of a self-gravitating spherically symmetric dust cloud with an arbitrary density profile and any distribution of initial velocities, encoded in three arbitrary functions $f(R)$, $F(R)$, and $\tau_0(R)$, where $R$ is a radial coordinate in the comoving reference frame. A particular choice of these functions corresponds to a wormhole geometry with a throat defined as a sphere of minimum radius at a fixed time instant. In this paper we explore LTB wormholes and discuss their possible observable appearance studying in detail the effects of gravitational lensing by such objects. For this aim, we study photon motion in wormhole space-time inscribed in a closed Friedmann dustfilled universe and find the wormhole shadow as it could be seen by a distant observer. Since the LTB wormhole is a dynamic object, we analyze the dependence of its shadow size on the observation time and on the initial size of the wormhole region. We reveal that the angular size of the shadow exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the observation time. At early times, the shadow size decreases as photons with smaller angular momentum gradually reach the observer. At later times, the expansion of the Friedmann Universe becomes a dominant factor that leads to an increase in the shadow size.",
New submissions,Plunge spectra as discriminators of black hole mimickers,Sreejith Nair,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This work explores the prospect of using the plunge to identify potential black hole mimickers. We show that the plunge excites two generic spectral features. (i) At low frequencies, there is a comb of sharp resonances at the real parts of the mimicker quasi-normal modes. (ii) Above a threshold $M\omega_{\rm th}\!\approx\!0.39$ (for the dominant mode), the spectrum undergoes a qualitative break: with the black hole mimicker displaying significant deviations from the black hole. Though individual plunge SNRs in extreme mass ratio events are low and detecting them in a sea of noise is difficult, the coherent spectral features identified here may allow for enhancing the SNR by using multiple events.",
New submissions,"Transit dark energy cosmological models in generalized matter-geometry coupling theory using a non-linear form of $f(R,T,L_{m})$ function","Dinesh Chandra Maurya,Rashid Zia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We have investigated the cosmological consequences of the model in the recently developed gravity theory [Haghani and Harko, \textit{Eur. Phys. J. C} \textbf{81} (2021) 615.] using a non-linear form of the $f(R,T,L_{m})$ function and the latest observational datasets. For flat Friedman-Lema\^ıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime and $f(R,T,L_{m})= \alpha\,R+\beta\,RT+\gamma\,RL_{m}-\eta$ with $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\eta$ as coupling constants, we have solved the modified field equations to get the Hubble function $H(z)$ in terms of $H_{0}$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$, $\Omega_{\eta}$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$. To ensure that the model is consistent with the physically observed universe, we constrained the model parameters using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis on joint datasets of cosmic chronometer and Pantheon samples. Using these approximated model parameter values, we investigated the universe's cosmic evolution history, including the deceleration parameter, effective equation of state, dark energy equation of state, total dark energy density parameters, universe age, and so on. In addition, to assess the physical acceptability and stability of the generated model, we conducted the Om diagnostic test, causality test, and energy conditions test.",
New submissions,The Doppler boosted LISA response to gravitational waves,"Tom van der Steen,Henri Inchauspé,Thomas Hertog,Aurélien Hees",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The future space-based gravitational wave observatory LISA is expected to detect massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), ranging up to thousands. Such high-precision observations require accurate modeling of the detector response. However, current derivations of the response function neglect the motion of the spacecraft during light travel time, omitting velocity-dependent terms of order $\beta = v/c \sim 10^{-4}$. In this work, we derive the velocity-dependent corrections to the gravitational wave response. We analyze the contribution of the velocity-terms for MBHBs in the mass range $[10^6,10^8]\:\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ using a modified version of the state-of-the-art response simulator lisagwresponse. We find that corrections introduce residual SNRs up to $\sim 2$ for the loudest events and fractional differences up to $0.04\%$, compared to lisagwresponse. While small, these effects are comparable to current waveform modeling uncertainties and imprint distinctive sky-localization signatures, making them potentially relevant for parameter estimation of high-mass MBHBs and simulation of mock datasets.",
New submissions,Local Expansion Mechanisms for Quantum-Scale Wormholes,"Philipp Dorau,Albert Much",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Models of quantum spacetime that are consistent with quantum energy inequalities potentially enable the formation of Planck scale wormholes. Building on the proposal of Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever that such microscopic spacetime structures might be enlarged to macroscopic size, we revisit Roman's analysis of a wormhole in an inflationary de Sitter background. In this context, we introduce a refined quasi-local toy mechanism, which we call the local inflation bubble. This construction inflates a compact region of spacetime and thereby magnifies the underlying microstructure. Using the Einstein equations we determine the required stress-energy to sustain the bubble and obtain intrinsic lower bounds for the corresponding energy density, while acknowledging the continued reliance on exotic matter.",
New submissions,Quantum fields on self-similar spacetimes,Jochen Zahn,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study (scalar, not necessarily conformal) quantum fields on self-similar spacetimes. It is shown that in states respecting the self-similarity the expectation value of the stress tensor gives rise to a quantum Lyapunov exponent $\omega_q = 2$, with a leading coefficient which is geometric. Two examples for states respecting self-similarity are discussed. Our findings are in contradiction with results obtained via dimensional reduction.",
New submissions,Ten years of gravitational-wave astronomy,Emanuele Berti,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Ten years ago humankind achieved the first direct observation of gravitational waves. I give some personal recollections of that first detection. I also present an incomplete summary of what we have learned since then, and some speculations on what we may learn in the future.",
Cross submissions,GW231109_235456: A Sub-threshold Binary Neutron Star Merger in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a Observing Run?,"Wanting Niu,Chad Hanna,Carl-Johan Haster,Shomik Adhicary,Pratyusava Baral,Amanda Baylor,Bryce Cousins,Jolien D. E. Creighton,Heather Fong,Yun-Jing Huang,Rachael Huxford,Prathamesh Joshi,James Kennington,Alvin K. Y. Li,Ryan Magee,Duncan Meacher,Cody Messick,Soichiro Morisaki,Cort Posnansky,Surabhi Sachdev,Shio Sakon,Urja Shah,Divya Singh,Ron Tapia,Leo Tsukada,Aaron Viets,Zach Yarbrough,Noah Zhang",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a sub-threshold search for gravitational-wave inspirals from binary neutron stars using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model based on radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of about one per 50 years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7, which was first reported by the LVK in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five from the four LVK searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the reported candidate is approximately one per 10 years. If this event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 (+0.38, -0.07) solar masses. The event was localized to a region of 450 square degrees (90 percent probability) at a luminosity distance of 165 (+70, -69) megaparsecs.",
Cross submissions,Observing Spacetime,"Vijay Balasubramanian,Tom Yildirim",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Complex states of quantum gravity in flat and AdS gravity can have features that are inaccessible to classical asymptotic observers. The missing information appears to such observers to be hidden behind a horizon or in a baby universe. Here we use the gravitational path integral to ask whether quantum observables can access the hidden data. We show that generic probes give a universal result and contain no information about the state. However, a probe appropriately fine-tuned to the state can give a large signal because of novel wormhole saddles in the path integral. Thus, in these settings, asymptotic observers cannot easily determine the state of the universe, but can check a proposal for it. Using these fine-tuned probes we show that an asymptotic observer can detect information hidden in a disconnected baby universe. Furthermore we show that the state of a two-boundary black hole can be detected using Lorentzian operators localised on just one of the boundaries.",
Cross submissions,Trends in the Population of Binary Black Holes Following the Fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog: a Data-Driven Analysis,"Nir Guttman,Ethan Payne,Paul D. Lasky,Eric Thrane",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Current population models of binary black hole distributions are difficult to interpret because standard population inferences hinge on modeling choices, which can mask or mimic real structure. The maximum population likelihood ``$\pistroke$ formalism'' provides a means to investigate and interpret features in the distribution of binary black holes using only data -- without specifying a population model. It tells us if features inferred from current population models are truly present in the data or if they arise from model misspecification. It also provides guidance for developing new models by highlighting previously unnoticed features. In this study, we utilize the $\pistroke$ formalism to examine the binary black hole population in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4). Our analysis supports the existence of a gap around $45\,M_\odot$ in the secondary black hole mass distribution and identifies a widening in the distribution of the effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_\text{eff}$ near this mass as recently reported by Tong et al. (2025). Similar to earlier studies, we find support for an anti-correlation between $\chi_\text{eff}$ and mass ratio. However, we argue that this may be a spurious correlation arising from misspecification of the joint distribution of black hole masses. Furthermore, we identify support for dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes at approximately $\chi \approx 0.2$ and $\chi\approx0.7$. The data support the existence of a correlation between the spin magnitudes $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, though subsequent study is required to determine if this feature is statistically significant. The accompanying data release includes $\pistroke$ samples, which can be used to compare theoretical predictions to LVK data and to assess assumptions in parameterised models.",
Cross submissions,Coarse-Grained BCFT Tensor Networks and Holographic Reflected Entropy in 3D Gravity,"Ning Bao,Jinwei Chu,Yikun Jiang,Jacob March",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We use the framework of $\textit{BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.",
Cross submissions,"The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries","Lorenzo Ennoggi,Manuela Campanelli,Julian Krolik,Scott C. Noble,Yosef Zlochower,Maria Chiara de Simone",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph),"Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.",
Cross submissions,Testing the nature of compact objects in the lower mass gap using gravitational wave observations,"N. V. Krishnendu,Frank Ohme,K. G. Arun",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"As the compact binary catalog continues to grow rapidly, developing and refining tests to probe the nature of compact objects is essential for a comprehensive understanding of both the observed data and the underlying astrophysics of the binary population. We investigate the effectiveness of spin-induced multipole moments (SIQM) and tidal deformability measurements in distinguishing lower mass-gap black hole (BH) binaries from non-BH binaries with different mass and spin configurations. We perform model-agnostic tests on binary BH (BBH) simulations using full Bayesian inference, evaluating the independent and joint measurability of SIQM and tidal parameters across the parameter space. We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting spinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and tidal effects and (b) each effect individually. For case (a), recovery is performed using (i) a BBH model, (ii) a model incorporating both SIQM and tidal effects, and (iii) models including either SIQM or tidal effects. For case (b), we employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal effects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform model and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes. We find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to biases in parameter inference. Notably, when analyzing a simulated binary boson star-like signal with component masses $\rm{(4, 4) \, M_{\odot}}$ using a BBH model, the system is incorrectly identified as having masses $\rm{(8, 2) \, M_{\odot}}$. In contrast, using the correct recovery model that includes both SIQM and tidal deformability effects successfully recovers the true masses, highlighting the significance of waveform model accuracy in performing reliable distinguishability tests for compact objects in the low-mass gap.",
