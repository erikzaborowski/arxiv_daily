New submissions,Thermodynamics and shadow of Simpson-Visser black hole with phantom global monopoles,Ahmad Al-Badawi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the thermodynamics and shadow of a non-rotating Simpson Visser black hole with a phantom global monopole. The model is governed by three parameters: the coupling constant $\xi$, the energy scale of symmetry breaking $\eta$, and the bounce parameter $a$, which jointly influence horizon structure and observational signatures. Using specific heat and free-energy analysis, we show that small-horizon configurations are locally thermodynamically stable but never globally favored. Analytical solutions of null geodesics reveal that the photon sphere radius depends on the bounce parameter $a$ and the energy scale of symmetry breaking $\eta$, while the critical impact parameter is still unaffected by $a$. Moreover, the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter, showing that increasing $\eta$ enlarges both quantities for an ordinary global monopole, while reducing them in the phantom case. Our results highlight how the bounce parameter and phantom global monopole significantly alter the black hole's physical and geometric properties.",
New submissions,"Comparative Analysis of Holographic Dark Energy Models in $f(R,T^2)$ Gravity","M. Sharif,M. Zeeshan Gul,I. Hashim",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study investigates the Renyi Holographic dark energy, Sharma-Mittal Holographic dark energy and Generalized Holographic dark energy models in the framework of $f(R,T^2)$ gravity, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T^2$ represents the self-contraction of the stress-energy tensor. For this purpose we employed two horizons as infrared cut-offs, such as Hubble horizon and Ricci horizon. The analysis is conducted for a non-interacting scenario in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By considering a specific form of this modified gravity, we reconstruct the corresponding gravitational models based on these selected dark energy formulations. Additionally, a stability analysis is performed for all cases and the evolution of the equation of state parameter is examined. Our finding indicates that the reconstructed $f(R,T^2)$ models effectively describe both the phantom and quintessence phases of cosmic evolution, aligning with the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. This study highlights the deep interconnections between holographic dark energy models and modified gravity theories, offering valuable insights into the large scale dynamics of the cosmos.",
New submissions,Strong field gravitational lensing of particles by a black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole,"Guansheng He,Jiaxu Huang,Zhongwen Feng,Ghulam Mustafa,Wenbin Lin",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The gravitational lensing of relativistic and nonrelativistic neutral massive particles in the black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole spacetime is investigated in the strong deflection limit. Beginning with the explicit equations of motion of a massive particle in the regular spacetime, we achieve the equation of the particle sphere and thus the radius of the unstable timelike circular orbit. It is interesting to find that the particle sphere equation can reduce to the well-known photon sphere equation, when the particle's initial velocity is equal to the speed of light. We adopt the strong field limit approach to calculate the black-bounce-Schwarzschild deflection angle of the particle subsequently, and obtain the strong-deflection lensing observables of the relativistic images of a pointlike particle source. The observables mainly include the apparent angular particle sphere radius, the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the other ones which are packed together, and the ratio between the particle-flux magnification of the outermost image and that of the packed ones (or equivalently, their resulted magnitudelike difference). The velocity effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the particle from light speed on the corresponding strong-field lensing observables of the images of a pointlike light source in the regular geometry, along with these on the strong deflection limit coefficients and the critical impact parameter of the lightlike case, are then formulated. Serving as an application of the results, we finally concentrate on evaluating the astronomical detectability of the velocity effects on the lensing observables and analyzing their dependence on the parameters, by modeling the Galactic supermassive black hole (i.e., Sgr A$^{\ast}$) as the lens.",
New submissions,Light deflection in the gravimagnetic dipole spacetime,"Clémentine Dassy,Jan Govaerts",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The gravimagnetic dipole is an asymptotically flat, stationary, axisymmetric vacuum solution to Einstein's General Relativity describing two non-extreme black holes with equal masses and opposite NUT charges connected by a Misner string. The string tension's can be set to zero by choosing the black hole separation accordingly, yielding a stable system of oppositely rotating black holes at a fixed distance. Numerical simulations of massless particle geodesics reveal gravitational lensing effects for extended sources at infinity on the equatorial plane or on the vertical axis.",
New submissions,Chaotic Dynamics in Extremal Black Holes: A Challenge to the Chaos Bound,"Surojit Dalui,Chiranjeeb Singha,Krishnakanta Bhattacharya",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD),"We investigate chaotic dynamics in extremal black holes by analyzing the motion of massless particles in both Reissner-Nordström and Kerr geometries. Two complementary approaches (i) taking the extremal limit of non-extremal solutions and (ii) working directly in the extremal background, yield consistent results. We find that, contrary to naive extrapolation of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos bound, the Lyapunov exponent remains positive even at zero temperature. For Reissner-Nordström black holes, chaos diminishes but persists at extremality, while for Kerr black holes it strengthens with increasing spin. These results demonstrate that extremal black holes exhibit residual chaotic dynamics that violate the MSS bound, establishing them as qualitatively distinct dynamical phases of gravity.",
New submissions,Trapped photon region in the phase space of sub-extremal Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen spacetimes,"Carla Cederbaum,Karim Mosani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyse the geometry and topology of the trapped photon region in the domain of outer communication of sub-extremal Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen spacetimes. Specifically, we show that its projection to the (co-)tangent bundle forms a five-dimensional submanifold with topology $SO(3)\times \mathbb{R}^2$ in each setup. The proof adapts the method of Cederbaum and Jahns for sub-extremal Kerr spacetime.",
New submissions,A General Discussion on Photon Spheres in Different Categories of Spacetimes,"Chen-Kai Qiao,Ping Su,Yang Huang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Photon spheres have attracted considerable interest in the studies of black holes and other astrophysical objects. For different categories of spacetimes (or gravitational sources), the existence of photon spheres and their distributions are dramatically influenced by the geometric and topological properties of spacetimes and characteristics of the corresponding gravitational fields. In this work, we carry out a geometric analysis on photon spheres for different categories of spacetime (including black hole spacetime, ultra-compact object's spacetime, regular spacetime, and naked singularity spacetime). Some universal properties and conclusions are obtained for these spacetimes. We mostly focus on the existence of photon spheres, the total number of photon spheres $n = n_{\text{stable}} + n_{\text{unstable}}$, the subtraction of stable photon sphere and unstable photon sphere $w = n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}}$ in different categories of spacetimes. These conclusions are derived solely from geometric properties of optical geometry of spacetimes, irrelevant to the specific spacetime metric forms. Besides, our results successfully recover some important theorems on photon spheres proposed in recent years.",
New submissions,Impact of Higher-Order Modes on Eccentricity Measurement in Binary Black Hole Gravitational Waves,"Honglue Tang,Jinzhao Yang,Baoxiang Wang,Tao Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We investigate the systematic biases in measuring orbital eccentricity for binary black hole (BBH) mergers that arise when higher-order modes (HOMs) of gravitational waves are neglected in waveform modeling. Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($\Delta_e/\sigma > 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\rm det}\gtrsim120M_\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($\theta_\textrm{JN} \gtrsim 30^\circ$), and high SNRs ($\rho^N_\textrm{mf}\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\rm det}\gtrsim140M_\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\rm det}\sim100 M_\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational effects on a dissipative two-level atom in the weak-field regime,"Kaito Kashiwagi,Akira Matsumura",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the dissipative dynamics of a two-level atom in a weak gravitational field. Using the Feynman--Vernon influence functional formalism, we derive a quantum master equation describing the two-level atom interacting with a scalar field in a Newtonian gravitational field, and compute the energy dissipation rate of the atom. We find that the spontaneous emission rate (the dissipation rate in vacuum) is modified by the gravitational field. Specifically, this modification depends on the atom's dipole, the position of the atom relative to the source of the gravitational field, and the frequency of the scalar radiation emitted by the atom. Furthermore, we identify the parameter regimes in which the spontaneous emission rate is enhanced or suppressed by gravity. We also discuss how the modification arises from time dilation and dipole radiation in a weak gravitational field. These findings provide a theoretical basis for exploring gravitational effects in open quantum systems.",
Cross submissions,Electromagnetic Couplings of Dark Domain Walls,Nemanja Kaloper,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We extend Maxwell electrodynamics with a Chern--Simons coupling to a dark sector top form sourced by domain walls. Electromagnetic fields which cross such domain walls exhibit optical activity. We outline the parameter space where the theory satisfies the observational bounds from domain wall nucleation rates and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this regime, the discretely evanescent dark energy walls can produce a polarization rotation of cosmic microwave background by $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3} ~{\rm radians}$.",
Cross submissions,On the importance of radiation-era initial conditions for tensor perturbations,"Dražen Glavan,Juraj Klarić,Philipp Klose,Ignacy Sawicki",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Conservation of super-horizon tensor fluctuations is crucial for connecting inflation to observations. Starting from first principles, recent works have found violations of this conservation if free-streaming radiation is produced during reheating. We show that the non-conservation is sensitive to the radiation initial state, and argue that the physical state should be affected by tensor perturbations that are already present during reheating. The deviation from super-horizon conservation is then negligible, recovering the standard result from kinetic theory. In contrast, a globally homogeneous and isotropic plasma state leads to a large suppression of tensor amplitudes. This difference between the local (physical) and global thermal equilibrium settles the discrepancy between the older and recent literature.",
Cross submissions,A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum,"I. Dalianis,A. Katsis,N. Tetradis",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.",
Cross submissions,Propulsion Trades for a 2035-2040 Solar Gravitational Lens Mission,Slava G. Turyshev,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL) enables multipixel imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy of a nearby terrestrial exoplanet from heliocentric distances $z\simeq 650$-$900$ AU, where solar power is negligible and transportation largely sets time-to-first-science. Reaching 650 AU in 20 yr implies a ballistic lower bound $\bar v_r \simeq 32.5~{\rm AU/yr}\simeq 154$ km/s, motivating propulsion beyond chemical and gravity-assist-only options. We compare close-perihelion solar sailing, fission-powered nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), and Oberth-enabled hybrid injection using simple time-to-distance models that isolate the long outbound leg (i.e., excluding architecture-dependent inner-solar-system injection overhead). For solar sailing, $r_p=0.05$ AU requires $\sigma_{\rm tot}\simeq 4.9~\mathrm{g\,m^{-2}}$ for $v_\infty\simeq 105$ km/s and $\sigma_{\rm tot}\simeq 2.3~\mathrm{g\,m^{-2}}$ for $v_\infty\simeq 155$ km/s, placing sub-20 yr sail-only access in an ultra-low-areal-density, deep-perihelion survivability regime. For NEP, a constant-power stage closure shows that a $m_0=20$ t spacecraft with $m_{\rm pay}=800$ kg and $\eta=0.7$ reaches 650 AU in ~27-33 yr for $\alpha_{\rm tot}=10$-$20~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ (typical optima $P_e\simeq 0.18$-$0.30~\mathrm{MW_e}$, thrust of a few newtons). NEP-only sub-20 yr transfers require extremely aggressive assumptions ($\alpha_{\rm tot}\lesssim 3~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ and very-high-$I_{\rm sp}$, long-life EP), whereas hybrid architectures become plausible for $\alpha_{\rm tot}\sim 10$-$15~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ if an injection stage supplies $v_0\gtrsim 50$-70 km/s prior to NEP cruise. We map these requirements to technology readiness and identify system-level demonstrations needed by the early 2030s for a credible 2035--2040 start.",
Cross submissions,Parametric Resonance and Backreaction Effects in Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Dark Matter,"Nirmalya Brahma,Robert Brandenberger(McGill University)",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We take a more detailed look at the recently proposed magnetogenesis mechanism triggered by ultralight dark matter coupled to electromagnetism. The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects.",
Cross submissions,Restoring Landauer's Principle for Unitarily Transformed Thermal Reservoirs,Hao Xu,Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of quantum information and thermodynamics, appears to be violated when the thermal reservoir is replaced by a squeezed thermal state (STS). We introduce a formal extension of the principle to such unitarily transformed thermal states. By defining an effective Hamiltonian, we rigorously establish a generalized Landauer inequality, which naturally reduces to the standard case for an ordinary thermal reservoir as a special instance. The framework further yields a consistent definition of entropy production and a proof of its non-negativity. We illustrate its utility by studying an arbitrarily moving Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a quantum field initially prepared in the STS. Using perturbation theory, we compute the entropy production explicitly, confirming its positivity. As a result of the symmetry breaking induced by the unitary transformation, it depends on both the proper time interval and the absolute spacetime position. Our work resolves the apparent violation of Landauer's principle with STSs. It also provides a robust tool for analyzing quantum thermodynamics in non-equilibrium and relativistic settings, with potential implications for quantum thermal machines and information protocols.",
Cross submissions,Emergent Hawking Radiation and Quantum Sensing in a Quenched Chiral Spin Chain,"Nitesh Jaiswal,S. Shankaranarayanan",Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the emergence and detection of Hawking radiation (HR) in a 1D chiral spin chain model, where the gravitational collapse is simulated by a sudden quantum quench that triggers a horizon-inducing phase transition. While our previous work Jaiswal [2025] established that this model mimics BH formation conditions even when the Hoop conjecture is seemingly violated, we here focus on the resulting stationary radiation spectrum and its detectability. By mapping the spin chain dynamics to a Dirac fermion in a curved (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime, we analyze the radiation using two complementary approaches: field-theoretic modes and operational quantum sensors. First, using localized Gaussian wave packets to model realistic detectors, we find that the radiation spectrum exhibits deviations from the ideal Planckian form, analogous to frequency-dependent greybody factors, while retaining robust Poissonian statistics that signal the loss of formation-scale information. Second, we introduce a qubit coupled to the chain as a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the qubit functions as a faithful quantum sensor of the Hawking temperature only in the weak-coupling regime, where its population dynamics are governed solely by the bath spectral density. In the strong-coupling limit, the probe thermalizes with the global environment, obscuring the horizon-induced thermal signature. These results provide a clear operational protocol for distinguishing genuine analog HR from environmental noise in quantum simulation platforms.",
