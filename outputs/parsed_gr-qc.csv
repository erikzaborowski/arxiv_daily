New submissions,Interacting Barrow holographic dark energy model in the presence of radiation and matter,"Gopinath Guin,Souvik Paul,Sunandan Gangopadhyay",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We have studied the effect of radiation in the interacting barrow holographic dark energy model for a non-flat universe. For both open and closed universes, we have obtained the evolution equation for the density parameters for dark energy, dark matter and radiation for a specific kind of interaction among the seven possible linear interactions; the analysis with the remaining six interactions will be updated soon in this manuscript. We have then numerically solved those coupled differential equations to show their behaviour with the redshift parameter. We have also found different epochs corresponding to dark energy-dark matter, dark energy-radiation and dark matter-radiation crossings. We have also obtained various observational constraints for our interacting Barrow holographic dark matter model using the Cosmic chronometer data and BAO data. In the upcoming version of the manuscript, we will add the observational constraints of our model using Pantheon data, also several calculations of other interaction scenarios will be added.",
New submissions,Searching for intermediate mass ratio binary black hole mergers in the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA,"Mark Ho-Yeuk Cheung,Digvijay Wadekar,Ajit Kumar Mehta,Tousif Islam,Javier Roulet,Emanuele Berti,Tejaswi Venumadhav,Barak Zackay,Matias Zaldarriaga",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of binary black holes with mass ratios $10^{-4}\lesssim q \lesssim 0.1$ are astrophysically interesting sources of gravitational waves. Mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with stellar-mass black holes would be IMRIs, so their detection can help us probe the formation mechanisms of IMBHs. They can also help us perform precise tests of general relativity due to the presence of strong higher-order mode emission. We perform a search for aligned-spin IMRIs within the data of the two LIGO detectors in the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, including higher modes in the template banks for the first time. We use the IAS-HM pipeline for our search and construct template banks in the range $1/100 < q<1/18$ using the SEOBNRv5HM waveform model. Our banks retain a similar level of effectualness for IMRPhenomXHM and BHPTNRSur2dq1e3 waveforms, making our search results relatively robust against waveform systematics. We show that the sensitivity volume of the search increases by up to $\sim 500\%$ upon inclusion of higher modes. We do not find any significant candidates with inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) $> 1$ year in the O3 data. This gives us upper limits on the IMRI merger rate in the local Universe, ranging from $\sim 30$ to $10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ depending on the masses of the black holes in the binary. These constraints are consistent with rate predictions in the literature. Our projections indicate that we would be able to detect IMRIs or constrain some of their proposed formation channels in the fourth (O4) and fifth (O5) observing runs.",
New submissions,Impact of a complex scalar spectator field on baryon asymmetry within spontaneous baryogenesis,"Mattia Dubbini,Orlando Luongo,Marco Muccino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We extend the framework of spontaneous baryogenesis by investigating the generation of baryon asymmetry when the inflaton, $\theta$, is minimally coupled with a complex spectator scalar field $\phi$, as $\theta^2|\phi|^2$. To do so, we also consider $\phi$ non-minimally coupled with the Ricci scalar curvature $R$ through a Yukawa-like interaction. We do not consider further interactions of the spectator field with the fermions of the Standard Model, considering it \emph{de facto} as a dark scalar field. In evaluating the violation of the baryon-number conservation during the reheating epoch, in a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe, we follow a semiclassical approach, where $\theta$, $\phi$ and gravity are considered as classical fields, whereas the fermions are quantized. We solve the equations of motion for the inflaton and spectator fields, respectively at first and zero-order in perturbation theory, neglecting at first stage the expansion of the universe. Afterwards, we quantify how the spectator field modifies the inflationary dynamics and thus find the baryon asymmetry produced via the inflaton decays into fermion-antifermion pairs by computing the corresponding decay amplitudes. We therefore obtain small first order correction to standard spontaneous baryogenesis and finally discuss the mass-mixing between fermions. Accordingly, the effects of considering the universe expansion are accounted, showing when the coupling between $\phi$ and $R$ becomes noticeable in altering the overall baryon asymmetry.",
New submissions,Parameter estimation of gravitational waves from hyperbolic black hole encounters,"Chad Henshaw,Jacob Lange,Peter Lott,Richard O'Shaughnessy,Laura Cadonati",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Systems of two black holes with unbound orbits can produce a diverse array of gravitational wave signals with rich morphology. This parameter space encompasses both hyperbolic orbit scattering events and dynamical captures, including zoom-whirl orbits with multiple flybys and direct plunge mergers. These signals challenge traditional parameter estimation infrastructure, which is largely optimized for quasicircular inspiral binaries. In this work we discuss the adaptation of the Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) algorithm to this problem using the TEOBResumSDALI waveform model which can simulate generic orbits. We present results from a study of simulated signals emulating a scatter and plunge event, utilizing the design sensitivity of the forthcoming Cosmic Explorer interferometer. Our analysis demonstrates that RIFT accurately recovers the mass, spins, and hyperbolic orbit parameters: the system energy and angular momentum defined at a fiducial initial separation.",
New submissions,A Multimessenger Strategy for Downselecting the Orientations of Galactic Close White Dwarf Binaries,Naoki Seto,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The planned space-based gravitational wave detector, LISA, will provide a fundamentally new means of studying the orbital alignment of close white dwarf binaries. However, due to the inherent symmetry of their gravitational wave signals, a fourfold degeneracy arises in the transverse projections of their angular momentum vectors. In this paper, we demonstrate that by incorporating timing information from electromagnetic observations, such as radial velocity modulations and light curves, this degeneracy can be reduced to twofold.",
New submissions,A Gaussian process framework for testing general relativity with gravitational waves,"Lachlan Passenger,Shun Yin Cheung,Nir Guttman,Nikhil Kannachel,Paul D. Lasky,Eric Thrane",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Gravitational-wave astronomy provides a promising avenue for the discovery of new physics beyond general relativity as it probes extreme curvature and ultra-relativistic dynamics. However, in the absence of a compelling alternative to general relativity, it is difficult to carry out an analysis that allows for a wide range of deviations. To that end, we introduce a Gaussian process framework to search for deviations from general relativity in gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers with minimal assumptions. We employ a kernel that enforces our prior beliefs that - if gravitational waveforms deviate from the predictions of general relativity - the deviation is likely to be localised in time near the merger with some characteristic frequency. We demonstrate this formalism with simulated data and apply it to events from Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3. We find no evidence for a deviation from general relativity. We limit the fractional deviation in gravitational-wave strain to as low as 7% (90% credibility) of the strain of GW190701_203306.",
New submissions,Cosmic Backgrounds in the Gravitational Standard-Model Extension,"C. M. Reyes,C. Riquelme,M. Schreck,A. Soto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We consider background fields within the gravitational sector of the Standard-Model Extension (SME) in a cosmological setting. Our analysis is divided into two parts. The first part addresses the consistency of nondynamical backgrounds in scenarios where diffeomorphism invariance is explicitly broken. Focusing on gravitational systems that admit Killing vector fields and possess a priori symmetries, we demonstrate that potential discrepancies between Riemannian geometry and dynamical equations can be avoided. The second part presents a direct application of various techniques developed by decomposing the modified Einstein equations along normal and tangential directions of the (3+1) decomposition. We show that nondynamical backgrounds can lead to accelerated cosmological expansion without requiring a cosmological constant, thereby opening new avenues for interpreting dark energy.",
New submissions,Structure of Kerr black hole spacetimes in Weyl conformal gravity,"Miguel Yulo Asuncion,Keith Horne,Reinosuke Kusano,Martin Dominik",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We analyze the stationary, uncharged, rotating, vacuum solution to Weyl conformal gravity. We elucidate the causal and ergoregion structure of the spacetimes found in the parameter space of the metric for positive mass. These are then compared to the corollary Kerr, Kerr-de Sitter, and Kerr-Anti-de Sitter solutions to general relativity. Additionally, we investigate and derive the extremal limits for both the horizons and ergosurfaces of the spacetimes.",
New submissions,"The Crossed Product, Modular (Tomita) Dynamics and its Role in the Transition of Type $III$ to Type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann Algebras and Connections to Quantum Gravity",Manfred Requardt,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),We analyse the role of the crossed product and the modular (Tomita) dynamics in the transition of type $III$ to type $II_{\infty}$this http URLalgebras which was recently observed in papers by Witten et al. In a preceding paper we argued that type $II_{\infty}$this http URLalgebras display certain features which we attributed to quantum gravity effects. We claim that the action of the modular evolution on the quantum fluctuations can be understood as an aspect of quantum gravity. We mention in this context the work of Sakharov on induced gravity. Furthermore we analyse the change of the properties of projectors and partial isometries in the transition from type $III$ to type $II_{\infty}$.,
New submissions,Bouncing Bianchi Models with Deformed Commutation Relations,"Gabriele Barca,Steffen Gielen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the anisotropic Bianchi I and Bianchi II models in vacuum in the framework of deformed commutation relations (DCRs). Working in a parametrisation of the spatial metric by a volume and two anisotropy variables, we propose modified Poisson brackets that for the volume alone reproduce the bounce dynamics of effective loop quantum cosmology (LQC), with additional modifications for anisotropy degrees of freedom. We derive effective Friedmann equations and observe cosmological bounces both in Bianchi I and Bianchi II. For Bianchi II, we find that the cosmological bounce now interacts with the usual reflection seen in the Kasner indices in various interesting ways, in close similarity again with what had been seen in LQC. This suggests that the DCR framework could model more general quantum-gravity inspired bounce scenarios in a relatively straightforward way.",
New submissions,Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing,"Panagiotis Dorlis,Nick E. Mavromatos,Sarben Sarkar,Sotirios-Neilos Vlachos",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective.",
New submissions,Quasinormal modes of nonlocal gravity black holes,"Rocco D'Agostino,Vittorio De Falco",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a comprehensive study of the quasinormal modes of a new class of nonlocal static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions within the framework of the revised Deser-Woodard theory of gravity. These solutions are constructed as linear perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime and are characterized by an inverse power-law behavior of the lapse metric function. We derive the radial profiles of the effective potentials corresponding to scalar, electromagnetic and axial gravitational fluctuations on the BH background. Using the WKB method, complemented by Padé approximants to regularize the trend of the effective potential near its peak, we compute the complex quasinormal mode frequencies associated with each type of perturbation. Our results are examined from both mathematical and physical perspectives, and are substantiated with references to existing literature. In particular, we compare the numerical outcomes with the predictions of the Schwarzschild metric to quantify deviations from the framework of general relativity. When all types of perturbations are combined, the relative deviations of the fundamental modes can reach up to $\sim 12\%$. Finally, we discuss the possibility to place observational bounds in the BH parameter space, based on the predicted sensitivities of future gravitational wave detectors.",
New submissions,Locally Rotationally Symmetric Spacetimes in Einstein-Cartan Theory and Their Classification,"Ujjwal Agarwal,Sante Carloni",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We present the complete set of covariant equations that govern the locally rotationally symmetric torsion spacetimes sourced by Weyssenhoff fluid in Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble gravity. Using these equations, we can explore in detail the peculiar relationship between conformal structure and torsion. We develop a comprehensive scheme to categorize these torsional spacetimes into distinct classes. We explicitly analyze the properties of each class and obtain novel analytical solutions to the gravitational field equations.",
New submissions,Gravitational memory effects in Tachyon gravity,"Pouneh Safarzadeh Ilkhchi,Amin Rezaei Akbarieh,Ali Seraj",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we explore how a massless Tachyon field, when non-minimally coupled to gravity, affects gravitational memory, soft theorems, and symmetries near null infinity. We set up the model using both the Jordan and Einstein frames, work out the equations of motion and study the behavior of fields at large distances with the Bondi-Sachs gauge. The Tachyon adds a ``breathing'' polarization mode to the gravitational radiation, which modifies the Bondi mass loss formula and leaves a trace in the displacement memory effect. We also derived the leading and subleading soft factors, involving the radiation of a soft graviton or a soft scalar.",
New submissions,Spacetime reconstruction by order and number,Mathias Braun,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Probability (math.PR),"We show that the random adjacency matrices induced by the chronological relations and i.i.d. samples of two spacetimes coincide in law if and only if the spacetimes in question are smoothly isometric. A similar result holds for weighted spacetimes. In the smooth framework of our article, this relaxes the hypotheses of the recent Gromov reconstruction theorem in Lorentzian signature by Braun-Sämann from a.s. isometry of the respective time separation functions to a.s. order isometry. In a probabilistic way, our result makes a key paradigm of causal set theory rigorous: spacetime can be recovered by only knowing ""order"" and ""number"" of its points. It confirms a weak version of Bombelli's conjecture; therefore, it contributes to recent efforts of formalizing the Hauptvermutung (viz. fundamental conjecture) of causal set theory.",
New submissions,Nonlinearities in Kerr Black Hole Ringdown from the Penrose Limit,"D. Perrone,A. Kehagias,A. Riotto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),We provide a fully analytical approach to calculate the nonlinearities of the gravitational waves in the ringdown of a Kerr black hole in the eikonal limit. The corresponding quasi-normal modes are associated to the orbits of a closed circular null geodesic and the problem can be analyzed by taking the Penrose limit around it. We calculate analytically the amplitude and the phase of the quadratic quasi-normal modes as well as its dependence on the black hole spin.,
New submissions,"Dirty Black Holes, Clean Signals: Near-Horizon vs. Environmental Effects on Grey-Body Factors and Hawking Radiation","Roman A. Konoplya,Thomas D. Pappas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Grey-body factors are not only essential ingredients for computing the intensity of Hawking radiation, but also serve as characteristics of black hole's geometry that are closely related to their quasinormal modes. Importantly, they tend to be more stable under small deformations of the background spacetime. In this work, we carry out a detailed analysis of grey-body factors and Hawking radiation for a spherically symmetric black hole subject to localized deformations which do not alter the Hawking temperature: near-horizon modifications to simulate possible new physics or matter fields, and far-zone perturbations to model environmental or astrophysical effects. We show that environmental deformations have only a minor impact on the grey-body factors and Hawking radiation--unless the additional potential barrier created by the environment becomes comparable in height to the primary peak associated with the black hole itself, a scenario more relevant to nonlinear dynamics. In contrast, near-horizon deformations significantly affect the Hawking spectrum, particularly in the low-frequency regime.",
Cross submissions,New cosmological solutions from type II de-Sitter gaugings in 4D $N=4$ gauged supergravity,H. L. Dao,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, which is a follow-up ofarXiv:2102.06512, we document new cosmological solutions from four-dimensional $N=4$ matter-coupled supergravity. The solutions smoothly interpolate between a $dS_2\times S^2$ spacetime at $t\rightarrow -\infty$ and a $dS_4$ spacetime at $t\rightarrow +\infty$ and arise from the second-order equations of motion. Unlike the previously reported solutions inarXiv:2102.06512that involve the diagonal $U(1)$ subgroup of both the electric and magnetic factors in the gauging, these solutions only require a single $U(1)$ factor from either the electric or magnetic part. Two additional features of these solutions that distinguish them from the previously presented solutions are the nonvanishing value of the dilaton $\phi$ and the fact that they are only admitted by the type II de-Sitter gauged theories.",
Cross submissions,A Mid-Thirties Crisis: Dissecting the Properties of Gravitational Wave Sources Near the 35 Solar Mass Peak,"Soumendra Kishore Roy,Lieke A. C. van Son,Will M. Farr",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1<20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical merger models, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.",
Cross submissions,Effect of symmetry energy on properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars and universal relations,"Pion Sudarshan Yeasin,Stefanos Tsiopelas,Armen Sedrakian,Jia-Jie Li",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"We investigated universal relations for compact stars rotating at the Keplerian (mass-shedding) limit, which ishighly relevant for understanding the rapidly rotating objects formed in the aftermath of a neutron star-neutronstar merger. Our analysis is based on a set of nucleonic EoS featuring systematic variations in the symmetryenergy slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}$ and the isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$, varied within rangesthat are broadly consistent with current laboratory and astrophysical constraints. The global observableproperties of isolated maximally rotating stars are examined, focusing on the mass-radius relation,moment of inertia, quadrupole moment, and the Keplerian (maximum) rotation frequency, as well as theirvariations in the $L_{\rm sym}$-$Q_{\rm sat}$ parameter space. Next, we demonstrate that, in the limit of Keplerianrotation, universal relations remain valid across the same set of EoSs characterized by varying $L_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$.In particular, we present explicit results for the moment of inertia and quadrupole moment as functions of compactness,as well as for the moment of inertia - quadrupole moment relation. All of these relations exhibit excellent universality,with deviations typically within a few percent and rarely exceeding 10\% across a wide range of parameters.These findings support the applicability of $I$-Love-$Q$-type universal relations in observational modelingof maximally rotating compact stars and the gravitational wave emitted by them, when accounting for significantvariation in the symmetry energy and high-density behavior of the nuclear EoS.",
Cross submissions,A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography,"Hayley J. Macpherson,Asta Heinesen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.",
Cross submissions,Entanglement on a Sphere,"Konstantinos Boutivas,Dimitrios Katsinis,Georgios Pastras,Nikolaos Prountzos,Nikolaos Tetradis",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),We study the entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field in the background of the Einstein universe. We determine numerically the structure of the UV-divergent terms. We study analytically the IR term that originates in the long-range correlations arising from the field zero mode on the sphere. We compare with previous results for a scalar field in a dS or AdS background.,
Cross submissions,Characterizing Compact Object Binaries in the Lower Mass Gap with Gravitational Waves,"Jessica Cotturone,Michael Zevin,Sylvia Biscoveanu",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The gravitational wave event GW230529 was the first compact binary merger observation reported in the fourth observing run of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observatory network. The more massive component of the GW230529 source binary was inferred to contain a compact object in the lower mass gap, a purported gap between the most massive neutron stars and least massive black holes based on compact object observations in the Milky Way. However, the properties of the mass-gap object, such as its exact mass and spin, remain unresolved due to statistical uncertainties. To investigate the properties of the GW230529 source binary, we perform parameter estimation on a suite of simulated gravitational wave systems with similar parameters. We vary the intrinsic properties of the simulated systems, the detector noise properties, the signal-to-noise ratios, and the waveform model used in recovery. We find that the low signal-to-noise ratio of GW230529 is the key reason for the ambiguity in determining whether the mass of the primary object in the binary is consistent with a low-mass black hole or a high-mass neutron star, since the priors for the masses and spins have a significant impact on the posterior distribution. The inclusion of tidal effects in the waveform model also contributes to the observed degeneracies in the posteriors. We show that a higher signal-to-noise ratio in future observations of mass-gap gravitational wave sources will increase the precision of the measurements and allow us to determine whether the components are black holes or neutron stars.",
Cross submissions,Radio emission from tidal disruption events produced by the collision between super-Eddington outflows and the circumnuclear medium,"Fangyi(Fitz)Hu,Adelle Goodwin,Daniel J. Price,Ilya Mandel,Re'em Sari,Kimitake Hayasaki",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this Letter, we simulate the collision between outflows from the tidal disruption of a 1M$_\odot$ main sequence star around a $10^6$M$_\odot$ black hole and an initially spherically symmetric circumnuclear cloud. We launch super-Eddington outflows self-consistently by simulating the disruption of stars on both bound and unbound initial orbits using general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find shocks formed as early as $\sim 10~$days after the initial stellar disruption produce prompt radio emission. The shock radius ($\approx~10^{17}$~cm), velocity ($\sim 0.15$c) and total energy ($\sim 10^{51}$ erg) in our simulations match those inferred from radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We ray-trace to produce synthetic radio images and spectra to compare with the observations. While the TDE outflow is quasi-spherical, the synchrotron emitting region is aspherical but with reflection symmetry above and below the initial orbital plane. Our synthetic spectra show continuous decay in peak frequency, matching prompt radio TDE observations. Our model supports the hypothesis that synchrotron radio flares from TDEs result from the collision between outflows and the circumnuclear material.",
Cross submissions,Slow Stable Self-bound Hybrid Star Can Relieve All Tensions,"Chen Zhang,Juan M. Z. Pretel,Renxin Xu",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii at the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event. In this study, we demonstrate that all these anomalous observations and tensions, together with other conventional ones such as recent NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and PSR J0437-4715, can be naturally explained simultaneously by a new general type of hybrid stars that are self-bound and radially stable in the slow phase transition context, and by some subsets even in the rapid phase transition context also. As a proof of concept, we use hybrid quark stars, inverted hybrid stars, and hybrid strangeon stars as benchmark examples to explicitly demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of slow stable self-bound hybrid stars in relieving all tensions related to compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities.",
Cross submissions,Nonlinear reconstruction of general dark energy theories,"Yunhao Gao,Baojiu Li,Jie Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The large variety and number of dark energy (DE) theories make it impractical to perform detailed analyses on a case-by-case basis, which has motivated proposals to ``parameterize"" theories to reduce the size of theory space. The leading approach to do this is the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE), which can describe general Horndeski-type theories with a small number of observationally accessible time-dependent functions. However, the EFTofDE primarily works for linear perturbations, and extending it to obtain a fully non-linear description of DE theories, which is critical for theories with screening mechanisms, is challenging. In this paper, we present a general method for reconstructing the non-linear DE Lagrangian from the background expansion history and certain linear-perturbation quantities, building upon the EFTofDE framework. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this method is applicable to a wide range of single-scalar-field dark energy and modified gravity theories, including quintessence, scalar-tensor theory, $k$-essence, and generalized cubic Galileon with shift symmetry. For each of these theories, we discuss the validity of the method and factors affecting its results. While this method involves solving differential equations, we find that the initial conditions are not important for quintessence, scalar-tensor theory and $k$-essence, while for shift-symmetric cubic Galileon, the generic tracker solution can help transform differential equations into algebraic equations. This offers a useful framework to connect cosmological observations at the background and linear-perturbation levels to the underlying non-linear dynamics of dark energy, and will enable cosmological simulations to analyze and examine DE theories systematically and in much greater detail.",
Cross submissions,The principle of least action for random graphs,"Ioannis Kleftogiannis,Ilias Amanatidis",Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We study the statistical properties of the physical action $S$ for random graphs, by treating the number of neighbors at each vertex of the graph (degree), as a scalar field. For each configuration (run) of the graph we calculate the Lagrangian of the degree field by using a lattice quantum field theory(LQFT) approach. Then the corresponding action is calculated by integrating the Lagrangian over all the vertices of the graph. We implement an evolution mechanism for the graph by removing one edge per a fundamental quantum of time, resulting in different evolution paths based on the run that is chosen at each evolution step. We calculate the action along each of these evolution paths, which allows us to calculate the probability distribution of $S$. We find that the distribution approaches the normal(Gaussian) form as the graph becomes denser, by adding more edges between its vertices. The maximum of the probability distribution of the action corresponds to graph configurations whose spacing between the values of $S$ becomes zero $\Delta S=0$, corresponding to the least-action (Hamilton) principle, which gives the path that the physical system follows classically. In addition, we calculate the fluctuations(variance) of the degree field showing that the graph configurations corresponding to the maximum probability of $S$, which follow the Hamilton's principle, have a balanced structure between regular and irregular graphs.",
Cross submissions,Icarus's Orbit as the Ultimate Test for the Vulcan Hypothesis and General Relativity,Souren Petik Pogossian,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"General Relativity (GR) quantitatively accounts for the anomalous perihelion precession observed in several planets' orbits, with Mercury exhibiting the most significant deviation from Newtonian predictions. In the present work, I carry out an in-depth study comparing methods for calculating perihelion advance of inner planets using two methods, one based on the rotation of the Laplace-Runge-Lentz vector and the other on the evolution of the perihelion longitude. I show that, although the two methods predict almost identical perihelion advances for inner planets according to classical gravitational theory and the general relativity model, they give divergent results for the asteroid Icarus. Comparing numerical calculations of Icarus'perihelion advance with those predicted by Einstein's formula leads to the conclusion that only the method based on the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector offers a consistent explanation for the behavior of Icarus' perihelion advance. By incorporating the hypothetical planet Vulcan into the Newtonian gravitational model and analyzing its influence on the perihelion advances of the inner planets, I find that carefully selecting Vulcan's mass and orbital parameters yields a delicate balance between its semi-major axis and mass necessary to simultaneously match the observed perihelion advances of the inner planets. Vulcan, orbiting at a semi-major axis of 0.545 AU and possessing about one-third the mass of Mercury, could exert gravitational effects on Earth and Mars comparable to those predicted by GR. This Vulcan would cause an effect on Icarus' perihelion advance approximately nine times greater than the relativistic effect. Thus, precise observational data of Icarus's orbital dynamics offers a definitive means to either rule out this specific Vulcan hypothesis or, conversely, indicate the necessity of further refinement of GR's applications.",
Cross submissions,Phases of Tree-decorated Dynamical Triangulations in 3D,"Timothy Budd,Dániel Németh",High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"This work revisits the Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation (DT) approach to non-perturbative quantum gravity in three dimensions. Inspired by a recent combinatorial study by T. Budd and L. Lionni of a subclass of 3-sphere triangulations constructed from trees, called the \emph{triple-tree} class, we present a Monte Carlo investigation of DT decorated with a pair of spanning trees, one spanning the vertices and the other the tetrahedra of the triangulation. The complement of the pair of trees in the triangulation can be viewed as a bipartite graph, called the \emph{middle graph} of the triangulation. In the triple-tree class, the middle graph is restricted to be a tree, and numerical simulations have displayed a qualitatively different phase structure compared to standard DT. Relaxing this restriction, the middle graph comes with two natural invariants, namely the number of connected components and loops. Introducing corresponding coupling constants in the action, allows one to interpolate between the triple-tree class and unrestricted tree-decorated DT. Simulations of this extended model confirm the existence of a new phase, referred to as the \emph{triple-tree phase}, besides the familiar crumpled and branched polymer phases of DT. A statistical analysis of the phase transitions is presented, showing hints that the branched polymer to triple-tree phase transition is continuous.",
Cross submissions,Toward graviton detection via photon-graviton quantum state conversion,"Taiki Ikeda,Youka Kaku,Sugumi Kanno,Jiro Soda",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"A magnetic field enables the interconversion of photons and gravitons, yet the process is usually analysed only at the level of classical wave equations. We revisit photon-graviton conversion in a quantum field theoretic framework, allowing us to track the evolution of arbitrary quantum states. Treating the photons as squeezed coherent states and the gravitons as the squeezed vacuum expected for primordial gravitational waves, we derive analytic expressions for the conversion probability and show that it can be significantly enhanced compared to the conventional estimate. We further demonstrate that the conversion both swaps preexisting entanglement and generates genuinely new entanglement between the electromagnetic and gravitational sectors, which is impossible in any classical description. Detecting such nonclassical correlations would constitute compelling evidence for the quantization of gravity and offers a novel pathway toward graviton detection.",
Cross submissions,Kinetic Fragmentation of the QCD Axion on the Lattice,"Matteo Fasiello,Joanes Lizarraga,Alexandros Papageorgiou,Ander Urio",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Kinetic misalignment, one of the most compelling scenarios for the non-thermal generation of axion dark matter, is generally accompanied by axion fragmentation, a process in which the energy of the axion condensate is transferred to its perturbations. The dynamics of fragmentation, at least in the context of dark matter production, have so far been studied semi-analytically using perturbation theory. In this work, we present the first classical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of dark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our findings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice lead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a sustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller occupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the final dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear approximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction. This broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact on axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic fragmentation.",
Cross submissions,Neutrino mass tension or suppressed growth rate of matter perturbations?,"William Giarè,Olga Mena,Enrico Specogna,Eleonora Di Valentino",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM value ($\gamma \simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\sum m_\nu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$. This preference increases to $\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\sum m_\nu \ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.",
Cross submissions,$E_6$ Unification of Freeze-In Dark Matter and Leptogenesis,"Adeela Afzal,Rishav Roshan",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the possibility of \emph{freeze-in} dark matter production and baryogenesis in an $E_6$ extension of the Standard Model, featuring a residual $U(1)_{\psi'}$ gauge symmetry. This symmetry arises from a linear combination of $U(1)\chi$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$, both of which are subgroups of the $E_6$. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\psi'}$ symmetry governs the dynamics of a singlet fermion, which naturally serves as a freeze-in dark matter candidate. The dark matter mass arises from dimension-five operators, and a discrete symmetry ensures their stability. We show that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic abundance for dark matter masses between few MeV to a few hundred GeV. Simultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.",
Cross submissions,Cosmological Frequency Combs,"Oem Trivedi,Madhurendra Mishra,Adarsh Ganesan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD),"We identify a new class of time periodic attractor solutions in scalar field cosmology, which we term Cosmological Frequency Combs (CFC). These solutions arise in exponential quintessence models with a phantom matter background and exhibit coherent phase-locked oscillations in the scalar field's normalized variables. We demonstrate that such dynamics induce modulations in observables like the Hubble parameter and growth rate, offering a dynamical mechanism to even address the H0 tension exactly. Our results uncover a previously unexplored phase of cosmic acceleration, linking the concept of frequency combs to large scale cosmological evolution.",
