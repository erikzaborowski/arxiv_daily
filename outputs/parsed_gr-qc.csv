New submissions,Lecture Notes in Loop Quantum Gravity. LN4: Hamiltonian framework,"Lorenzo Fatibene,Marco Ferraris,Andrea Orizzonte",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We discuss a covariant setting for Hamiltonian formalism in a relativistic field theory and we use this to obtain again the properties of Hamilton principal functional in Newtonian mechanics, relativistic mechanics, Klein-Gordon, electromagnetism, and Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi gravitational theory.",
New submissions,"Impact on Inferred Neutron Star Equation of State due to Nonlinear Hydrodynamics, Background Spin, and Relativity","Joseph Bretz,Hang Yu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Tidal interaction is a unique, detectable signature in gravitational wave signals from inspiraling binary neutron stars (BNSs), which can be used to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS). The tidal interaction is resonantly amplified as the orbital frequency approaches the NS fundamental mode (f-mode) frequency. It has been shown that the exclusion of tidal resonance in parameter estimation leads to a significant bias in the inferred NS tidal deformability and hence the NS EoS [Pratten et al. PRL 129, 081102 (2022)]. The strength and location of tidal resonance depend sensitively on the f-mode frequency, which is typically modeled using its universal relation with the tidal deformability that is derived for an isolated, non-spinning NS assuming only linear fluid perturbations. In a BNS inspiral, the f-mode frequency can be corrected by at least three known effects: nonlinear hydrodynamics, background spin, and relativity. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the systematic bias on tidal deformability when each frequency correction is ignored. Our study considers both loud, individual events and the stacking of a population of detections. Both scenarios are expected when the next-generation detectors are available with a sensitivity level increased by about an order of magnitude.",
New submissions,"Classification of Oppenheimer-Snyder Collapse: Singular, Bouncing, and Soft-Landing Scenarios","Zhi-Chao Li,H. Khodabakhshi,H. Lu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) gravitational collapse matched to a general static, spherically symmetric exterior spacetime. Unlike the Schwarzschild case, two new features can arise in black holes with two horizons: an apparent-horizon left vertex, a temporary minimum in the apparent-horizon radius during collapse, and a bounce, where the star surface stops collapsing at a nonzero radius and reverses into expansion. We identify the conditions that lead to these two features. For two-horizon exteriors, trapped-region consistency requires that the apparent-horizon turning point occurs no earlier than the surface crossing of the inner horizon. As a concrete example, the OS collapse of the Reissner-Nordström (RN) spacetime shows both effects. In contrast, regular black holes with de Sitter cores show neither: their collapse is smooth and monotonic, and the surface approaches the center only as the proper time goes to infinity. These results naturally classify the OS collapses into three categories: singular, which ends at the center in finite time; bouncing, which reverses at a finite radius; and soft-landing, which reaches the center only asymptotically. We argue that these features are consistent with Penrose's strong cosmic censorship conjecture.",
New submissions,Influence of spatial curvature in cosmological particle production,"Jose A. R. Cembranos,Luis J. Garay,Álvaro Parra-López",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We analyze cosmological particle production driven by spacetime expansion in the early universe for homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies with positive, negative, and zero spatial curvature. We prioritize analytical results to gain a deeper understanding of curvature-induced effects. Specifically, for a conformally coupled scalar field, we model the inflationary epoch as an exact de Sitter phase followed by a transition to a static universe. Both instantaneous and smooth exits from inflation are considered, the latter being implemented via the adiabatic vacuum prescription. Starting from an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum, we derive the associated mode functions carefully adapted to each curvature sign. Using the Bogoliubov formalism, we non-perturbatively compute the number density of produced scalar particles. Our results demonstrate that spatial curvature significantly impacts the resulting particle spectra, particularly for light fields, where the deviation from the flat-space scenario is most prominent and can reach several orders of magnitude",
New submissions,Suppression of Gravitational-Wave Echoes in Diffeomorphism-Invariant Nonlocal Gravity,J. W. Moffat,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Searches for late--time gravitational--wave echoes following compact binary mergers are often interpreted as probes of exotic near--horizon or horizonless physics. We show that a well--motivated class of ultraviolet--finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism--invariant, analytic, entire--function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational--wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley--Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum--gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit.",
New submissions,Transverse expansion of the metric at null infinity,"Marc Mars,Gabriel Sánchez-Pérez",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In this paper we analyze the conformal Einstein equations to all orders at null infinity without imposing any restriction on the spacetime dimension, the topology of $\mathscr{I}$, or fall-off conditions for the Weyl tensor. In particular, we study how the equations constrain the geometry of null infinity when it is assumed to be foliated by cross-sections, not necessarily spheres. Our approach is coordinate-free and treats the conformal factor $\Omega$ as a dynamical variable. After identifying the free data at $\mathscr{I}$, we show that any two asymptotically flat spacetimes sharing the same free data at null infinity are necessarily isometric to infinite order. In addition, we provide a detached definition of null infinity and prove an existence theorem for asymptotically flat spacetimes solving the field equations to infinite order at $\mathscr{I}$ realizing the prescribed initial data.",
New submissions,On the instability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential,"Shui-Fa Shen,Guan-Ru Li,Ramin G. Daghigh,Jodin C. Morey,Michael D. Green,Qiyuan Pan,Cheng-Gang Shao,Wei-Liang Qian",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It was recently pointed out that the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential is unstable against an insignificant Gaussian metric perturbation, which, in turn, might substantially challenge the black hole spectroscopy. This intriguing result has been interpreted by some authors as arising from essentially replacing the black hole's effective potential and its perturbation with two disjoint potential barriers. We argue that such an analysis may have oversimplified the real physical scenario. To be more precise, a metric perturbation planted farther away from the black hole horizon might not always be appropriately approximated by a disjoint minor barrier. Particularly, for the perturbed Pöschl-Teller potential, joint and disjoint metric perturbations might lead to drastically different stability properties for the low-lying modes. Following this line of thought, this study conducts a refined analysis of the stability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential by closely examining a few physically relevant ingredients. While our analysis qualitatively confirms the main findings of previous studies, as the stability of the fundamental mode is primarily determined by the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency, we show that specific features of both the effective potential at spatial infinity and the metric perturbation can have a sizable impact on the instability. In contrast, the spiral period, governed by the real part of the quasinormal frequency, appears largely insensitive to the details of the black hole metric or its perturbations. The analytic estimates are in reasonable agreement with the numerical results.",
New submissions,Effects of nonlinear interactions on the superradiant instability of charged black holes,"Bo-Wen Qin,Yu-Peng Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A Reissner-Nordström black hole (RNBH) enclosed in a cavity is known to be superradiantly unstable to charged scalar perturbations below a critical frequency. Inspired by the emergence of the QCD axion as a prominent dark matter candidate, we construct a model featuring an axion field coupled to an electromagnetic field that undergoes superradiant growth around an RNBH. Utilizing numerical relativity, we achieve stable, long-term evolution of this system and perform a comparative analysis across various parameter spaces. Our comprehensive investigation reveals the formation of a hairy black hole, whose final state is governed by a diverse set of physical parameters. Notably, the decay constant in the axion potential, representing nonlinear interactions, bifurcates the superradiant instability into two distinct behavioral regimes, leading to more significant dynamical shifts than previously reported. Furthermore, we examine the influence of the scalar field's charge and mass, as well as the mirror's position. We investigate the axionic bosenova process and observe a long-term beating pattern of the axion field induced by nonlinear interactions. By fine-tuning these parameter combinations, we demonstrate that the system can evolve toward a variety of distinct physical endpoints.",
New submissions,Modification of Aberration due to the Helicity-Rotation Coupling,Bahram Mashhoon,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We review the physical basis for the assumption of locality in relativistic physics and its connection with the aberration of starlight. As a consequence of the hypothesis of locality, the standard relativistic formulas for the Doppler effect and aberration are independent of the polarization of the incident electromagnetic or gravitational radiation. The modification of these formulas due to the helicity-rotation coupling are discussed. In connection with the aberration of polarized radiation, we note that the helicity of radiation incident on a rotating observer couples to its angular velocity of rotation resulting in a slight helicity-dependent modification of the standard aberration formula. We discuss the physical origin of this effect and estimate the magnitude of the helicity aberration.",
New submissions,Detecting gravitational wave background with equivalent configurations in the network of space based optical lattice clocks,"Mingzhi Lou,Hong Su,Tao Yang,Yun-Long Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"The network of space based optical lattice clocks (OLCs) has been proposed to detect the stochastic gravitational wave background. We investigate the overlap reduction function (ORF) of the OLC detector network and analytically derive a transformation that leaves the ORF invariant. This transformation is applicable to configurations with two OLC detectors, each equipped with a one-way link. It can map a configuration with small separation and high noise correlation to another configuration with larger separation and reduced noise correlation. Using this transformation, we obtain a favourable OLC detector network configuration with high cross-correlation response, and compare its sensitivity to that of space-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors.",
New submissions,"""Waveforms"" at the Horizon","Andrea Cipriani,Francesco Fucito,Carlo Heissenberg,Jose Francisco Morales,Rodolfo Russo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study perturbations induced by a light particle scattering off a Schwarzschild black hole. Exploiting recent results for the wave propagation in this geometry, we derive the fields that this process induces on the horizon to leading order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) regime, when the light probe is far from the black hole. We then use these results to calculate the fluxes of energy and angular momentum that enter the black hole. We consider the effects due to gravitational, electromagnetic and scalar radiation, finding agreement with recent computations of the absorbed energy, while the absorbed angular momentum provides a new PM result.",
New submissions,Horizon Multipole Moments of a Kerr Black Hole,"Eric Gourgoulhon,Alexandre Le Tiec,Marc Casals",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The horizon multipole moments of a Kerr black hole are computed from two distinct definitions that have been proposed in the literature. The first one [Ashtekar et al., Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 2549 (2004)] regards axisymmetric isolated horizons, while the second one [Ashtekar et al., J. High Energ. Phys. 2022, 28 (2022)] applies to generic (i.e., not necessarily axisymmetric) non-expanding horizons. We review these definitions in a common frame and perform a detailed study of the resulting multipole moments for the Kerr event horizon. The horizon multipoles are found to share several properties with the (Hansen) field multipoles, including parity constraints and the leading scaling behavior with respect to the Kerr spin parameter a in the regime of small a. For the axisymmetry-based definition, we have obtained a closed-form expression of the multipole moments in terms of a and the spherical harmonic degree l. For the generic definition, we have established closed-form expressions for the conformal unit round metric, the `electric' and `magnetic' potentials related to the multipoles, and the values of the multipoles in the small a limit. We show that the two definitions lead to different values of the Kerr horizon multipoles as soon as l >= 1 (generic nonzero value of a) or l >= 2 (small a limit).",

Cross submissions,Scattering Gravitons off General Spinning Compact Objects to $\mathcal{O}(G^2 S^4)$,Dogan Akpinar,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We compute the classical one-loop gravitational Compton amplitude describing the scattering of a graviton off a massive spinning compact object at the second post-Minkowskian order, including terms through the quartic order in spin. Our analysis includes spin-induced finite-size effects up to the hexadecapolar order, and extends recent results obtained for minimal couplings at the quadratic order in spin. From the amplitude, we determine the scattering phase in momentum space, applicable in both the eikonal and wave regimes. In the eikonal limit, we then isolate the spin-independent contribution of the graviton field, explicitly linking it to the dynamics of a massless scalar probe in a Kerr background. This constitutes the first complete description of classical one-loop Compton scattering for generic spinning compact objects at the second post-Minkowskian and hexadecapolar orders.",
Cross submissions,"Black Hole Thermodynamic Ensembles, Euclidean Action and Legendre Transformation",Liang Ma,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In thermodynamics, a Legendre transformation of the free energy provides a mapping between different statistical ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate that performing a Legendre transformation of the black hole on-shell action is equivalent to imposing different boundary conditions on the fields. Consequently, the choice of ensemble must be consistent with, and cannot contradict, the imposed boundary conditions. From this perspective, it follows that for four-dimensional dyonic black holes, the on-shell action can only be expressed either as a function of the electric charge and the magnetic potential, or alternatively as a function of the magnetic charge and the electric potential. Inspired by the Legendre transformation of the Maxwell field, we argue that for purely gravitational theories whose metric geometries admit a \(U(1)\) fiber bundle structure, i.e.\ rotating, boosted, or Kaluza-Klein monopole configurations, one can similarly introduce appropriate Legendre terms, in the sense of dimensional reduction, to modify the thermodynamic ensemble of the black hole. Within the dimensional reduction framework, we study the on-shell action of black holes in five-dimensional minimal supergravity with a Chern-Simons term, analyze the corresponding Legendre transformation procedure, and show how the resulting formulation remains consistent with the Wald formalism.",
Cross submissions,Testing black hole space-times with the S2 star orbit: a Bayesian comparison,"César Navarrete,Fernando Vázquez-Chávez,Alejandro Cruz-Osorio,Néstor Ortiz",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to obtain posterior probability distributions for the parameters of the S2 star orbit around Sagittarius A*, for seven representative non-rotating black hole space-time solutions. In particular, we consider the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, and Bardeen black hole space-times from General Relativity, as well as a black hole solution from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, a hairy black hole solution from Horndeski theory, and a Yukawa-like black hole from $f(\mathscr{R})$ gravity. To constrain model parameters, we use the most recent publicly available observational data of the S2 star orbit, namely astrometric measurements, spectroscopic data, and the pericentre advance measured by the GRAVITY Collaboration. We further perform a consistent Bayesian comparison of models, calculating the log-Bayes factor of each space-time with respect to the Schwarzschild solution. Our results show that the currently available data indicate no statistically significant preference among the space-times considered. The Bardeen and Yukawa-like models are indistinguishable from Schwarzschild within current uncertainties, while the Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, Horndeski and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton geometries show at most weak and non-decisive strength of evidence under the adopted priors and likelihood choices.",
Cross submissions,Intereses convergentes: los años previos a la visita de Einstein a la Argentina en 1925,Alejandro Gangui,History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze in some detail the years leading up to Albert Einstein's visit to Argentina, from the moment he rose to fame after the publication of the results of the 1919 solar eclipse, until his arrival at the port of Buenos Aires in March 1925. We will see that this major event in the country's cultural life did not arise from a vacuum but was the product of diverse interests and unique international and local circumstances. The social and political situation surrounding the eminent scientist and the impetus provided by individuals and institutions in Buenos Aires played a decisive role, ultimately converging in the ""successful"" reception of this extraordinary figure in a country on the scientific periphery of the first quarter of the 20th century. We also review the written references and knowledge circulating in the local milieu on topics related to the theory of relativity in the years prior to his arrival in the country.",
Cross submissions,Holographic pressure and volume for black holes,"Silvester Borsboom,Manus R. Visser",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We advocate for a holographic definition of thermodynamic pressure and volume for black holes based on quasi-local gravitational thermodynamics. When a black hole is enclosed by a finite timelike boundary, York's quasi-local first law includes a surface pressure conjugate to the boundary area. Assuming the existence of a holographically dual theory living on this boundary, these geometric quantities correspond to the pressure and volume of the dual thermal system. In this work we focus on static, spherically symmetric black holes, for which these quantities reduce to global thermodynamic variables. The holographic volume provides a notion of system size, allowing extensivity to be defined in standard thermodynamic terms, and it yields a definition of the large-system limit. For the asymptotically flat case, we show that, in the canonical thermodynamic representation, small Schwarzschild black holes are non-extensive, whereas large black holes become extensive in the large-system limit. A similar conclusion applies to Anti-de-Sitter Schwarzschild black holes, with the difference that the quasi-local energy of the large black hole also becomes extensive in the large-system limit. Before this limit, the energy decomposes into subextensive and extensive contributions, and we derive an explicit expression for the extensive part as a function of the finite volume and entropy.",
Cross submissions,Searching for gravitational waves from compact binary mergers powering long gamma-ray bursts during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O3 run,"Mallika R. Sinha,Teagan A. Clarke,Qifang Zhang,Nikhil Sarin,Eric Thrane,Paul D. Lasky",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Neutron star binary mergers are often associated with short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but the recent detection of kilonovae coincident with long GRBs suggest that some mergers may produce long GRBs. Motivated by these developments, we perform a search for binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole gravitational-wave signals coincident with long GRBs using data from the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) observing run. We analyze LVK data coincident with long GRBs detected by Fermi's GRB Monitor and Swift's Burst Alert Telescope when at least two gravitational-wave observatories were running. We find no evidence of a coincident gravitational-wave signal and set limits on the luminosity distance to each of these long GRBs under the assumption that they were powered by binary mergers.",
Cross submissions,Ersatz gravity and black-hole thermodynamics from Manin gauge theory with noncompact gauge group,"Leron Borsten,Dimitri Kanakaris,Hyungrok Kim",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We show that a three-dimensional Manin gauge theory with gauge group $\operatorname{SL}(2;\mathbb R)$ (i.e. Yang-Mills theory, the third-way theory, or the imaginary third-way theory) minimally coupled to Einstein gravity admits a dual interpretation as Einstein gravity with an exotic coupling to a Manin gauge theory, where the roles of dreibein/spin connection and field strength/gauge potential are interchanged. The dual, or ersatz, gravitational metric $\hat g_{\mu\nu}\sim\operatorname{tr}((\star F)_\mu (\star F)_\nu)$ is a classical double copy of the gauge field strength $F_{\mu\nu}$ (as opposed to the usual double copy of the gauge potential $A_\mu$). If matter exclusively couples to $\hat g$ (for example, in a gravitational decoupling limit), then one can formulate black-hole thermodynamics with regards to the ersatz metric. In particular, a black-hole solution for the ersatz metric $\hat g_{\mu\nu}$ (made of Yang-Mills fields) radiates ersatz Hawking radiation and obeys the laws of black-hole thermodynamics.",
Cross submissions,Dimensional structure of thermodynamic topology in ultraspinning Kerr-AdS black holes,"Min Tian,Ying Chen,Di Wu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we apply the thermodynamic topology framework to ultraspinning Kerr-AdS black holes in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. By constructing the off-shell Helmholtz free energy and the associated vector field, black hole states are characterized as topological defects, and their phase structures are described through zero points, winding numbers, and asymptotic thermodynamic behavior. Analyses of the four- and five-dimensional cases highlight the differences between even- and odd-dimensional configurations, while representative higher-dimensional cases confirm that no additional topological classes or subclasses emerge. We find that only two thermodynamic topological structures appear: the standard class $W^{1+}$ for most configurations, and the distinct subclass $\tilde{W}^{1+}$ for odd-dimensional black holes with maximal rotations. These results establish a unified, dimension-independent classification scheme for ultraspinning Kerr-AdS black holes.",
Cross submissions,"Dark Energy After DESI DR2: Observational Status, Reconstructions, and Physical Models",Slava G. Turyshev,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We review late-time cosmic acceleration after DESI Data Release~2 (DR2), emphasizing the interplay between Type~Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), anisotropic BAO, CMB calibration, and perturbation-sensitive probes (RSD and weak lensing). DESI DR2 delivers percent-level BAO distance ratios over $0\lesssim z\lesssim2.5$, including a Ly$\alpha$-forest anchor at $z_{\rm eff}=2.33$. In CMB-calibrated combinations, flat $\Lambda$CDM exhibits a mild parameter mismatch, while allowing evolving dark energy (e.g.\ CPL $w_0$--$w_a$) can improve the fit; the preference is dataset-dependent and is particularly sensitive to redshift-dependent SN calibration/selection residuals at the few$\times10^{-2}$\,mag level. To sharpen likelihood-level interpretation, we provide two diagnostics: (i) an $r_d$-independent BAO-shape observable, $F_{\rm AP}(z)\equiv D_{\rm M}(z)/D_{\rm H}(z)$, constructed directly from published $(D_{\rm M}/r_d,\,D_{\rm H}/r_d)$ with covariance propagation; and (ii) a linear-response map from SN Hubble-diagram systematics $\delta\mu(z)$ to induced biases in $(w_0,w_a)$, yielding an explicit calibration requirement for DESI-era claims of evolving $w(z)$. We synthesize parametric and non-parametric reconstructions of $w(z)$ and $\rho_{\rm DE}(z)$ and map the resulting phenomenology to microphysical dark-energy and modified-gravity models subject to perturbation stability and gravitational-wave propagation constraints.",
Cross submissions,Reconstructing cosmological correlators via dispersion: from cutting to dressing rules,"Shibam Das,Debanjan Karan,Babli Khatun,Nilay Kundu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we investigate how cosmological correlators can be reconstructed by applying the momentum-space dispersion formula to their discontinuities, treating them as functions of momentum variables associated with the corresponding de Sitter Witten diagrams. We focus on conformally coupled and massless polynomial scalar interactions (both IR-divergent and IR-convergent), and consider tree-level de Sitter Witten diagrams. We explicitly utilize the single-cut discontinuity relations, or cutting rules, involving the cosmological correlators recently constructed inarXiv:2512.20720. For diagrams with multiple interaction vertices, we apply the dispersion formula by cutting all internal lines in the diagram one by one, successively, thereby allowing us to reconstruct the full correlator using only lower-point contact-level objects and their discontinuity data, up to contact diagram ambiguities. We also rediscover how the cosmological correlators on the late-time slice of de Sitter space can be obtained from flat-space Feynman diagrams via a set of dressing rules. Our starting point, being the cutting rules for the cosmological correlators, also emphasizes how basic principles, such as unitarity for in-in correlators, can lead us to the dressing rules, which were previously derived in literature following a different method.",
Cross submissions,Bound States in Lee's Complex Ghost Model,Ichiro Oda,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Quantum field theories (QFTs) including fourth-derivative terms such as the Lee-Wick finite QED and quadratic gravity have a better ultra-violet behavior compared to standard theories with second-derivative ones, but the existence of ghost with negative norm endangers unitarity. Such a ghost in general acquires a pair of complex conjugate masses from radiative corrections whose features are concisely described by the so-called Lee model. Working with the canonical operator formalism of QFTs, we investigate the issue of bound states in the Lee model. We find that the bound states cannot be created from ghosts by contributions of a complex delta function, which is a complex generalization of the well-known Dirac delta function. Since the cause of unitarity violation in the Lee-Wick model is the existence of the complex delta function instead of the Dirac delta function, it is of interest to notice that the violation of the unitarity is also connected to the non-existence of bound states. Finally, the problem of amelioration of the unitarity in quadratic gravity is briefly discussed.",
Cross submissions,Forecast on $f(R)$ Gravity with HI 21cm Intensity Mapping Surveys,"Yanling Song,Yu Sang,Linfeng Xiao,Boyu Zhang,Bin Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Modified gravity theories offer a well-motivated extension of General Relativity and provide a possible explanation for the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. Among them, $f(R)$ gravity represents a minimal and theoretically appealing class, characterized by the Compton wavelength parameter $B_0$, which quantifies deviations from General Relativity. In this work, we explore the capability of future neutral hydrogen (HI) 21 cm intensity mapping (IM) observations to constrain $f(R)$ gravity at low redshifts. We perform Fisher-matrix forecasts for $B_0$ and standard cosmological parameters using upcoming 21 cm IM experiments, including BINGO and SKA1-MID (Band 1 and Band 2), both individually and in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors. We find that even near-term experiments such as BINGO are able to place nontrivial bounds on $B_0$, $\sigma(B_0)\simeq 2.27\times 10^{-6}$, while SKA1-MID yields substantially tighter constraints, with SKA Band 2 providing the strongest sensitivity among the considered configurations, $\sigma(B_0)\simeq 6.37\times 10^{-8}$. We further demonstrate that the combination of low-redshift 21 cm IM data with CMB observations efficiently breaks degeneracies with background cosmological parameters and leads to a significant improvement in the constraints on $B_0$. These results highlight the potential of future HI intensity mapping surveys, in combination with CMB measurements, to provide stringent tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales.",
Cross submissions,Coalescence Forensics: Weighing the Hosts of Hierarchical Binary Black Hole Mergers,"Avinash Tiwari,Shasvath J. Kapadia",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a novel framework to infer the mass of clusters that host hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected with gravitational-waves (GWs), on a single event basis. We show that the requirement that a second-generation (2G) remnant be retained, and subsequently undergo a dynamical encounter, places strong constraints on the mass of the cluster. Using a Plummer model as a readily interpretable baseline, we derive analytic scaling relations between the peak of the inferred host mass posterior, the GW-driven recoil velocity of the remnant, and the parameters that determine the structure of the host. We then perform exact numerical marginalization over thermal and recoil velocities, angles, and cluster structure parameters, to infer the host-mass posterior. We apply our framework to putative hierarchical mergers GW241011 and GW241110, and infer the masses of their hosts on a single-event basis. We find that these are consistent with either heavy globular clusters or nuclear star clusters, with inferred masses spanning $10^{5.7 - 7.7} M_{\odot}$ at $68\%$ confidence depending on the 2G recoil velocity distribution used.",
Cross submissions,Relativistic Dynamics and Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton Accretion onto Rotating Embedded Black Hole Models,"Asifa Ashraf,Orhan Donmez,Abdelmalek Bouzenada,Chengxun Yuan,Aylin Caliskan,Gulzoda Rakhimova,Ahmadjon Abdujabbarov",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we examine the motion of test particles and relativistic accretion mechanisms within the spacetime of a rotating and embedded BH. In this case, the geometric properties of the metric and their dynamical consequences for particle trajectories are systematically studied, with a specific focus on circular orbits together with their existence criteria and stability constraints. Also, the effective potential and the corresponding effective force are constructed to quantify the influence of rotation and embedding parameters on the attractive and repulsive sectors of the gravitational interaction. Closed-form expressions for orbital frequencies as measured by a distant observer are derived, enabling a quantitative analysis of relativistic precession phenomena, including periastron advance and Lense-Thirring precession. Furthermore, we conduct general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of BHL accretion onto rotating embedded BHs. In addition, within the framework of the BHL accretion mechanism, the numerical solution of the GRH equations shows that the embedding parameter \alpha systematically modifies the morphology of the shock cone formed around embedded BHs compared to the Kerr model. In particular, a wider opening angle of the cone is produced, the compression of matter in the post-shock region is weakened, and the dynamical variability of the flow is enhanced. The time-dependent mass accretion rate exhibits increasing oscillation amplitudes and long-term variations with increasing \alpha, while these amplitudes are found to be suppressed by the frame-dragging effect associated with the BH spin parameter. At the same time, increasing values of $\alpha$ lead to a strengthening of the QPO frequencies formed around embedded BHs in the LFQPO regime, enhancing their observability and increasing the likelihood of detecting commensurate frequency ratios such as 3:2.",

Shankar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent results from combined cosmological probes indicate that the Dark Energy component of the Universe could be dynamical. The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $\Omega_{DE}=\Omega_{\Lambda}+\Omega_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and the scalar field energy $\Omega_{x}$. Provided that $\Omega_{DE}\approx 0.7$, negative values of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z> 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $\Lambda CDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\gtrsim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ observed at $z\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M_{seed}\sim 10^2\,M_{\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $\Omega_{\Lambda}\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin.",
Cross submissions,"""It from Bit"": The Hartle-Hawking state and quantum mechanics for de Sitter observers",Ying Zhao,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"The one-state statement for closed universes has sparked considerable discussion. In this paper we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires neither mixing of alpha sectors nor any modification of the rules of the gravitational path integral. The apparent tension is resolved by sharply distinguishing the baby-universe Hilbert space, namely the space of closed universes viewed from the outside, from the bulk Hilbert space that governs quantum mechanics for an observer inside a single de Sitter universe. The baby-universe Hilbert space, together with its commutative operator algebra, is not a quantum-mechanical Hilbert space: it is merely a mathematical repackaging of classical probability theory and does not carry any quantum-mechanical structure at all, a direct consequence of the one-state property of closed universes. Accordingly, attempting to formulate quantum mechanics directly on the baby-universe Hilbert space conflates classical ensemble data with the quantum mechanics experienced by bulk observers and leads to physically incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the quantum mechanics experienced by an observer inside de Sitter space emerges from the classical statistics encoded in the baby-universe Hilbert space, providing a concrete realization of Wheeler's idea of ""It from Bit"". We demonstrate these features by completely solving a topological toy model of one-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Along the way we clarify the physical meaning of de Sitter entropy, showing that it corresponds to the coarse-grained entropy of the underlying state.",
Cross submissions,Cosmographic parameters from current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors,"Jonathan Morais,Rodrigo Gonçalves,Jailson Alcaniz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We evaluate the capability of current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, Einstein Telescope and DECIGO, to constrain cosmographic parameters using electromagnetically bright standard sirens. By adopting a third-order Taylor expansion, we analyze how signal-to-noise ratios and the number of events impact the estimates of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk ($j_0$) parameters. Our results show that while Advanced LIGO provides a calibration-free measurement of $H_0$ at the few-percent level, it remains insensitive to higher-order parameters. In contrast, the Einstein Telescope and DECIGO reach sub-percent accuracy for $H_0$. Notably, DECIGO achieves a precision better than 10\% for the deceleration parameter $q_0$ and a few tens of percent for the jerk parameter $j_0$.",
Cross submissions,Does Cosmology require Hermiticity in Quantum Mechanics?,"Oem Trivedi,Alfredo Gurrola",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We explore the consequences of allowing non-Hermitian structures in quantum cosmology by extending the Wheeler DeWitt framework beyond strictly Hermitian dynamics. Using a controlled semiclassical reduction, we show how anti Hermitian contributions propagate into both early universe primordial fluctuations and late-time structure growth as effective damping or gain terms. Confronting this framework with inflationary observables, growth of structure and the observed near flatness of the universe, we derive strong infrared constraints that suppress non Hermiticity across cosmic history. We demonstrate that these bounds are mutually consistent between early and late-time probes and can be partially relaxed in theories beyond General Relativity. Our results establish cosmology as a novel arena for testing foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and suggest that Hermiticity may emerge dynamically along the semiclassical branch describing our universe.",
Cross submissions,Holographic Aspects of Non-minimal $R^3 F^{(a)}_{μα}F^{(a)μα} $ Black Brane,Mehdi Sadeghi,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work investigates a modified theory of gravity where the Einstein-Hilbert action, including a cosmological constant, is non-minimally coupled to a Yang-Mills field via an $R^3 F^{(a)}_{\mu \alpha }F^{(a)\mu \alpha}$ interaction term. We derive a black brane solution for this model, accurate to the first order in the coupling parameter. Using gauge/gravity duality techniques, we then compute two key holographic transport coefficients: the color non-abelian direct current (DC) conductivity and the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density. Our analysis reveals that both transport coefficients are modified by the non-minimal coupling, with the conductivity bound violated for positive $q_2$ and the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound for shear viscosity violated for negative $q_2$. In the limit where the non-minimal coupling vanishes, our results consistently reduce to those of the standard Yang-Mills Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black brane.",
