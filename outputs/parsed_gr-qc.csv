New submissions,"Evolution of Wormholes under f(R, T) Theory, the Karmarkar Condition and the Casimir Energy",Murat Metehan Turkoglu,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this study, both the evolution of wormholes (by examining both the energy conditions and using the TOV equations) and the effects of the Karmarkar condition on the solutions obtained under certain specific cases were examined in the light of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory, using two $f(R,T)$ functions predicted to describe the accelerated expansion of the universe. In this context, for the first time in the literature, a generalized shape function was obtained using the Karmarkar condition. It was observed that solutions of the type $R-a_{1}^2/R+a_{2}g(T)$ satisfy the energy conditions (with the dominant energy condition being partially satisfied), whereas solutions of the type $R+a_{1}^2R^2+a_{2}g(T)$ require the presence of exotic matter. In both cases, stable, static, and traversable wormhole solutions were obtained. By applying the Karmarkar condition to the $R+a_{1}^2R^2+a_{2}g(T)$ type solutions, which violate the energy conditions, the relationship between wormhole geometry and energy conditions was investigated. The study examined whether the Karmarkar condition eliminates the need for exotic matter, and it was found that the solutions do not remove the necessity of exotic matter. Additionally, it was demonstrated that a specific value of the parameter, ${\beta}$, which determines the radial variation of the shape function, could ensure the stability of the wormhole throat with the aid of Casimir energy. In other words, it is considered possible that the geometric evolution of the wormhole throat could trigger the transition from positive energy (baryonic matter) to negative energy (dark matter, dark energy, or other exotic matter) by inducing Casimir forces.",
New submissions,Optimizing NN reduction in an atom interferometer network for GW detection,"Q. Cojean Palassoé,A. Bertoldi,A. Landragin,B. Canuel",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"The sensitivity of an atom gradiometer aiming to detect gravitational waves (GW) is impacted by fluctuations of Earth's gravity field also called Newtonian Noise (NN). Sensor arrays have proved to be a promising technique for NN reduction. In our study, we further investigate the benefits of Atom Interferometer (AI) networks by improving their geometry and the extraction of the GW signal. We focus on Seismic Newtonian Noise in the frequency band from 0.1 to 10 Hz. On one hand, we show that using a specific detector geometry, a better NN rejection can occur optimizing the number of gradiometers in the network. On the other hand, we show that carrying out optimization in sub frequency bands - which results in using various detector geometries from a common network - allows even higher NN rejection while keeping a similar number of interferometers.",
New submissions,The error budget of binary neutron star merger simulations for configurations with high spin,"Hao-Jui Kuan,Ivan Markin,Maximiliano Ujevic,Tim Dietrich,Kenta Kiuchi,Masaru Shibata,Wolfgang Tichy",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Numerical-relativity simulations offer a unique approach to investigating the dynamics of binary neutron star mergers and provide the most accurate predictions of waveforms in the late inspiral phase. However, the numerical predictions are prone to systematic biases originating from the construction of initial quasi-circular binary configurations, the numerical methods used to evolve them, and to extract gravitational signals. To assess uncertainties arising from these aspects, we analyze mergers of highly spinning neutron stars with dimensionless spin parameter $\chi=0.5$. The initial data are prepared by two solvers, \textsc{FUKA} and \textsc{SGRID}, which are then evolved by two independent codes, \textsc{SACRA} and \textsc{BAM}. We assess the impact of numerical discretizations, finite extraction radii, and differences in numerical frameworks on the resulting gravitational waveforms. Our analysis reveals that the primary source of uncertainty in numerical waveforms is the evolution code, while the initial data solver has a smaller impact. We also compare our numerical-relativity waveforms with state-of-the-art analytical models, finding that the discrepancies between them exceed the estimated numerical uncertainties. Few suggestions are offered: (i) the analytic waveform becomes an inadequate approximation after the two neutron stars come into contact and the binary enters the essentially-one-body phase, (ii) the analytical models may not capture finite-size effects beyond quadrupole moment, and (iii) the inconsistent use of the binary black hole baseline in the analytical models may also be contributing to these discrepancies. The presented results benchmark the error budget for numerical waveforms of binary neutron star mergers, and provide information for the analytic models to explore further the high spin parameter space of binary neutron star mergers.",
New submissions,Self-force framework for merger-ringdown waveforms,"Lorenzo Küchler,Geoffrey Compère,Adam Pound",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The prospect of observing asymmetric compact binaries with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors has motivated the development of fast and accurate waveform models in gravitational self-force theory. These models are based on a two-stage process: in a (slow) offline stage, waveform ingredients are pre-computed as functions on the orbital phase space; in a (fast) online stage, the waveform is generated by evolving through the phase space. While this framework has traditionally been restricted to the inspiral stage of a binary, we recently extended it across the transition to plunge, where the small companion crosses the innermost stable circular orbit around the primary black hole. In this paper, for the special case of quasicircular, nonspinning binaries, we show how the ""offline/online"" phase-space paradigm also extends through the final plunge, which generates the binary's merger-ringdown signal. We implement the method at leading, geodesic order in the plunge. The resulting plunge waveform agrees well with a stationary-phase approximation at early times and with a (self-consistently calculated) quasinormal mode sum at late times, but we highlight that neither of the two approximations reaches the peak of the full plunge waveform. Finally, we compare the plunge waveform to numerical relativity simulations. Our framework offers the prospect of fast, accurate inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform models for asymmetric binaries.",
New submissions,Performance of multiple filter-cavity schemes for frequency-dependent squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors,"Jacques Ding,Eleonora Capocasa,Isander Ahrend,Fangfei Liu,Yuhang Zhao,Matteo Barsuglia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Optics (physics.optics),"Gravitational-wave detectors use state-of-the-art quantum technologies to circumvent vacuum fluctuations via squeezed states of light. Future detectors such as Einstein Telescope may require the use of two filter cavities or a 3-mirror, coupled filter cavity to achieve a complex rotation of the squeezing ellipse in order to reduce the quantum noise over the whole detector bandwidth. In this work, we compare the theoretical feasibility and performances of these two systems and their resilience with respect to different degradation sources (optical losses, mismatching, locking precision). We provide both analytical models and numerical insights. We extend previous analysis on squeezing degradation and find that the coupled cavity scheme provides similar or better performances than the two-cavity option, in terms of resilience with respect to imperfections and optical losses. We propose a possible two-step implementation scheme for Einstein Telescope using a single filter cavity that can be possibly upgraded into a coupled filter cavity.",
New submissions,Coherent electrically-charged quantum black holes,"Tommaso Antonelli,Marco Sebastianutti,Andrea Giusti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We improve upon the results presented in [R. Casadio, et al., Phys. Rev. D 105 (2022) 124026] deriving a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordström geometry containing an integrable singularity at its center while being devoid of spurious oscillations around the classical configuration. We further investigate some relevant physical observables, related to geodesics and quasinormal modes of scalar perturbations, associated with this geometry to complement our theoretical analysis.",
New submissions,Dynamical Dark Energy from $F(R)$ Gravity Models Unifying Inflation with Dark Energy: Confronting the Latest Observational Data,"S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou,G.S. Sharov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"A class of viable $F(R)$ gravity models which can provide a unified description of inflation with the dark energy era is confronted with the latest observational data on the dark energy era. These models have the unique characteristic that the de Sitter scalaron mass in the Einstein frame counterpart theory is a monotonic function of the curvature, which renders them viable descriptions for both the inflationary and the late-time acceleration eras. We also compare these models with other well-known viable $F(R)$ gravity models and with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. As we show, the most phenomenologically successful models are those which deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. Also some of the models presented, provide a statistically favorable description of the dark energy eras, compared with the exponential $F(R)$ gravity model and of course compared with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. All the models we present in this article are confronted with the observational data from the Planck collaboration, the Pantheon plus data from Type Ia supernovae, the two rounds of observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, data from baryon acoustic oscillations and the Hubble constant measurements by SH0ES group. As we show, two of the models are statistically favorable by the data.",
New submissions,Targeted searches for gravitational waves from SN 2023ixf and SGR 1935+2154,Marek J. Szczepańczyk,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"The fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA has provided so far over 200 new gravitational-wave candidates, and it is still ongoing. A few results from this run are published and in this proceeding, we summarize the latest targeted search for GWs from SN 2023ixf and consider predictions for future searches. We also summarize the targeted search for GWs from a fast radio burst source SGR 1935+2154.",
New submissions,`Translation invariant' black hole: autoparallels and complete integrability,Jens Boos,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider the autoparallel motion of test bodies in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes with torsion. We prove complete integrability of such motion for a wide range of off-shell geometries via four commuting autoparallel Killing vectors. Since these vectors reduce to translation generators in a certain limit, we refer to these geometries as `translation invariant.' Invoking the field equations of quadratic Poincaré gauge gravity we re-derive an exact Schwarzschild black hole solution endowed with a non-trivial torsion field scaling as $GM/r^2$, where $M$ denotes the ADM mass of the black hole. Studying the qualitative orbital dynamics via effective potentials we find notable discrepancies between autoparallels (straightest possible paths) and geodesics (shortest possible paths).",
New submissions,Quantum light and radiation in Rindler spacetime: from uncertainty relations to the cosmological implications,"Fujin Wang,Syed Masood,L.G. Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Optics (physics.optics),"Based on an analogy between diffraction integral formalism of classical field propagation and Feynman path integral approach to quantum field theory, we develop a quantum model for light and radiation in Rindler spacetime. The framework helps to reveal acceleration-induced contributions to the traditional Heisenberg position-momentum uncertainty relation. A modified Planck energy density distribution of radiation is established and reveals equivalence between temperature and Rindler acceleration as advocated by standard Unruh and anti-Unruh effects. Later, by defining an equivalent acceleration, we investigate some cosmological implications of the model with regards to redshift and expansion of the Universe. In this context, we contend that the accelerated expansion of the Universe, in addition to possessing some well-defined limits corresponding to early and local Universe epochs, may also hint towards dynamical nature of dark energy. The findings provide glimpse into future table-top experiments aimed at emulating gravitational and other cosmological phenomena in terrestrial lab setups.",
New submissions,On the Phase-Magnitude Relation in Gravitational Lensing: Reformulation and Applications of the Kramers-Kronig relation,"Teruaki Suyama,Shasvath J. Kapadia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"It is known that the amplification factor, defined as the ratio of the lensed to the unlensed waveform in the frequency domain, satisfies the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relation, which connects the real and imaginary parts of the amplification factor for any lensing signal. In this work, we reformulate the KK relation in terms of the magnitude and phase of the amplification factor. Unlike the original formulation, the phase cannot be uniquely determined from the magnitude alone due to the possible presence of a Blaschke product. While this ambiguity does not arise in the case of a point-mass lens, it can appear in more complex lens models, such as those with an NFW lens profile. As an application of our formulation, we demonstrate that the leading-order behavior of the phase in the low-frequency regime is completely determined by the leading-order behavior of the magnitude in the same regime. This reproduces known results from the literature, derived via low-frequency expansions for specific lens models. Importantly, our result does not rely on any particular lens model, highlighting a universal feature that the low-frequency behavior of the amplification factor is tightly constrained by the KK relation. As a further application, we present two examples in which the phase is constructed from a given analytic form of the magnitude using the newly derived KK relation. In particular, the second example allows for an analytic evaluation of the KK integral, yielding an explicit expression for the phase. This study offers a potentially powerful method for applying the KK relation in model-agnostic searches for lensing signals.",
New submissions,Novel black holes with scalar hair in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar Theory with positive coupling,"Hong Guo,Wei-Liang Qian,Bean Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we find a new branch of hairy black hole solutions in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) theory in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes. Different from spontaneous scalarization induced by tachyonic instabilities in Reissner-Nordström (RN) black holes with a negative coupling parameter, these scalar-hairy black hole solutions arise when the coupling parameter is positive, where nonlinear coupling plays the dominant role, meaning that the coupling is positively correlated with the degree of deviation from the trivial state. Our numerical analysis reveals that the scalar field grows monotonically with the radial coordinate and asymptotically approaches a finite constant, exhibiting behavior that is qualitatively similar to that of the Maxwell potential. In these solutions, an increase in the charge $q$ causes the scalar-hairy solutions to deviate further from the RN state, while excessive charging drives the system back towards hairless solutions. Strengthening the coupling parameter compresses the existence domain of the scalar-hairy state, which lies entirely within the parameter region of RN black holes. Moreover, by evaluating the quasinormal modes, we show that the obtained scalar-hairy solutions are stable against linearized scalar perturbations.",
New submissions,Quintessence dark energy model in non-linear $f(Q)$ theory with bulk-viscosity,Dinesh Chandra Maurya,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we investigate a locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type-I cosmological model in non-linear form of $f(Q)$ gravity with observational constraints. We solved the modified Einstein's field equations with a viscous fluid source and got a hyperbolic solution. First, we apply MCMC analysis to the cosmic chronometer (CC) and Pantheon datasets to place observational constraints on model parameters. Using approximated model parameters, we study the cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble parameter $H$, the deceleration parameter $q$, and the equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{v}$ with the skewness parameter $\delta_{v}$ for the viscous fluid. In addition, we examined Om diagnostics and statefinder analysis to categorize dark energy models. We estimated the age of the current universe as $t_{0}\approx13.8$ Gyrs. We obtained a quintessential and ever-accelerating model with bulk viscosity fluid.",
New submissions,Thermodynamics and Shadows of Kerr black holes endowed with a global monopole charge,"Balendra Pratap Singh,Md Sabir Ali",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this article, we present the thermodynamic and shadow properties of rotating black holes with global monopole charge. The angular diameter of Sgr A$^{*}$ black hole is 48.7 $\pm$ 7 $\mu as$, which is 8 $kps$ far away having a mass of $M = 4.0_{-0.6}^{+1.1} \times 10^6 M\odot$ as observed by Event Horizon Telescope and for the M87 black hole, the observed angular diameter is $\theta_d = 42 \pm 3 \mu$as, which is almost $16$ $Mpc$ far away with a mass of $M = (6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 M_\odot$. The global monopole charge parameter $\alpha$ strongly affects the shape and size of the black hole shadow. We derived all the necessary equations to obtain the angular diameter of the rotating black hole shadow with the effect of the global monopole charge parameter $\alpha$. For $\alpha$$\in$ (0, 0.08) with $a$ $\in$ $(0.7 M, 0.99 M)$, the angular diameter of M87 black hole shadow varies from $39$ $\mu as$ to $51$ $\mu as$. The angular diameter of Sgr A$^{*}$ black hole with global monopole charge parameter $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 0.04) and $a$ $\in$ $(0.7 M, 0.99 M)$, varies from $50$ $\mu as$ to $55$ $\mu as$. For bound values of $\alpha$ and $a$, our results are consistent with the EHT observations.",
New submissions,Expansion-contraction duality breaking in a Planck-scale sensitive cosmological quantum simulator,"S. Mahesh Chandran,Uwe R. Fischer",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas),"We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.",
New submissions,Generalized Brans-Dicke theory from Verlinde's entropic gravity,"Salih Kibaroğlu,Mustafa Senay",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we develop a q-deformed scalar-tensor theory of gravitation by combining Verlinde's entropic gravity paradigm with statistical deformation effects. The resulting model modifies the Brans-Dicke framework through a deformation function, treated as a constant rescaling factor for the effective gravitational coupling. We derive the corresponding q-deformed field equations and analyze their theoretical consistency including the recovery of standard gravitational models in specific limits. While the present formulation preserves key symmetries and provides a generalized description of gravitational dynamics, it does not yield a significant deviation from Brans-Dicke theory. The study concludes with prospects for future research, including the exploration of cosmological solutions arising from the q-deformed field equations.",
New submissions,Realistic assessment of a single gravitational wave source localization taking into account precise pulsar distances with pulsar timing arrays,"Ryo Kato,Keitaro Takahashi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are anticipated to detect continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the near future. To identify the host galaxy of a GW source, PTAs require significantly improved angular resolution beyond the typical range of 100-1000 square degrees achieved by recent continuous GW searches. In this study, we investigate how precise pulsar distance measurements can enhance the localization of a single GW source. Accurate distance information, comparable to or better than the GW wavelength (typically 1~pc) can refine GW source localization. In the near future, with the advent of Square Kilometre Array (SKA), such high-precision distance measurements will be feasible for a few nearby pulsars. We focus on the relatively nearby pulsars J0437-4715 (156 pc) and J0030+0451 (331 pc), incorporating their actual distance uncertainties based on current VLBI measurements and the anticipated precision of the SKA-era. By simulating 87 pulsars with the GW signal and Gaussian white noise in the timing residuals, we assess the impact of the pulsar distance information on GW source localization. Our results show that without precise distance information, localization remains insufficient to identify host galaxies under 10 ns noise. However, incorporating SKA-era distance precision for nearby pulsars J0437-4715 and J0030+0451 can reduce localization uncertainties to the required level of $10^{-3}$ $\rm deg^{2}$. Localization accuracy strongly depends on the geometric configuration of pulsars with well-measured distances and improves notably near and between such pulsars. The improvement of the localization will greatly aid in identifying the host galaxy of a GW source and constructing an SMBHB catalog. It will further enable follow-up electromagnetic observations to investigate the SMBHB in greater detail.",
New submissions,Test Gravitational-Wave Polarizations with Space-Based Detectors,"Jun-Shuai Wang,Chang Liu,Ju Chen,Jibo He",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"In this work, we systematically investigate the capability of space-based gravitational wave detectors in constraining parameters of non-tensor polarization modes. Using Bayesian inference and Fisher Information Matrix methods, we analyze gravitational wave signals from the inspiral phase of supermassive binary black hole mergers. By starting with time-domain signals and applying Fourier transforms, we avoid the use of the stationary phase approximation. We found an asymmetry in the estimation of the vector-mode parameter $\alpha_x$ at inclination angles $\iota = 0$ and $\iota = \pi$, which has not been explicitly pointed out in previous studies. We also observe strong correlations between scalar-mode parameters, $\alpha_b$ and $\alpha_l$, which currently limit their independent estimation. These findings underscore the importance of using complete inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms to enhance the ability to distinguish the non-tensor polarization modes. Finally, we employ a new LISA-Taiji network configuration, in which the orientation of spacecrafts of Taiji maintains a fixed phase offset relative to these of LISA. Under the adiabatic approximation and the assumption of equal arms, this phase is found to have no significant effect on data analysis.",
New submissions,Interior of a black hole in the framework of the scalar quasiparticle model,"Sergey Bondarenko,Dima Cheskis,Raghvendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We have developed an effective thermodynamic model for a black hole's interior composed of scalar quasiparticles. The proposed interior consists of a core and a crust; the properties of both depend on the kinetics of the quasiparticles. In the core, the quasiparticles possess zero classical kinetic energy; the total potential energy $U(N)$ of the core depends only on the number $N$ of quasiparticles inside it. The thermodynamic description of this state of matter requires the introduction of an inverse temperature $\beta$ inversely proportional to $U(N)$ that supplants the standard temperature in every thermodynamic relation inside the core, driving both the energy density and the pressure negative. The different states of the core, correspondingly, can be parametrized by an additional parameter, which is a mean occupation number $\eta$ of the quasiparticles in the core. Concerning the crust, there are quasiparticles in it that remain trapped by the gravitational potential at finite temperature. The no-escape condition for the quasiparticles in the crust is imposed through a truncation of the phase-space integrals, yielding a direct and analytical coupling between thermodynamics and gravity. The resulting framework unifies core and crust within a single quasiparticle description, highlights the role of negative energy and pressure in black hole interiors, and provides testable predictions for any semiclassical theory that aims to resolve the singularity problem.",
New submissions,Constraints on Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy from DESI DR2 BAO data,"Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano,Andronikos Paliathanasis,Emmanuel N. Saridakis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) are two recently proposed extensions of the standard HDE framework, incorporating generalized corrections to horizon entropy through the use of Barrow and Tsallis entropies. Tsallis entropy arises from non-extensive statistical phenomena which account for long-range correlations and deviations from additivity, while Barrow entropy emerges from quantum-gravitational effects on the horizon geometry, associated with fractal modifications and deformations. At the cosmological level, both scenarios lead to the same equations, nevertheless the involved parameters obey different theoretical bounds. In this work, we use observational data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), including the recently released DESI DR2 dataset, to place constraints on both scenaria. We show that both can be in agreement with observations, although they cannot alleviate the $H_0$ tension. However, applying information criteria we deduce that both of them are not favoured comparing to $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmological paradigm.",
New submissions,Strong hyperboloidal compactification for the spherical DF-GHG formulation of GR,"Christian Peterson,David Hilditch",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The use of compactified hyperboloidal coordinates for metric formulations of the Einstein field Equations introduces formally singular terms in the equations of motion whose numerical treatment requires care. In this paper we study a particular choice of constraint addition, choice of gauge and reduction fields in order to minimize the number of these terms in a spherically symmetric reduction of the Dual-Foliation Generalized Harmonic Gauge formulation of General Relativity. We proceed to the numerical implementation of a more aggressive compactification, as compared to our previous work. With the present setup there is a direct analogy with conformal compactification used in other approaches to the use of hyperboloidal coordinates. We present numerical results of constraints violating and satisfying perturbations on top of a Schwarzschild black hole. For small perturbations we recover the expected physics from linear theory, corresponding to quasi normal mode ringing and tail decay for a scalar field, both extracted directly at future null infinity from our numerical data.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Bremsstrahlung in Black-Hole Scattering at $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$: Quadratic-in-Spin Effects,"Lara Bohnenblust,Harald Ita,Manfred Kraus,Johannes Schlenk",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We are employing a supersymmetric variant of the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) formalism to compute the far-field momentum-space gravitational waveform emitted during the scattering of two spinning black holes at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the post-Minkowskian expansion. Our results are accurate up to quadratic-in-spin contributions, which means we report for the very first time the waveform observable at the order $\mathcal{O}(G^3\mathcal{S}^2)$. Our computation is based on mapping $n$-body tree-level amplitudes in such a way that we can obtain the $(n-2)$-loop two-body waveform integrand. We discuss in detail this procedure and highlight the similarity of the resulting structures with those obtained in the scattering-amplitude approach. As a by product of our computational approach, we also obtain, for the first time, the leading-order waveform for three-body scattering of spinning black holes. We validated our results in various ways but most notably, we find exact agreement for the NLO waveform integrand obtained from the WQFT and the classical limit of scattering amplitudes in QFT.",
Cross submissions,On-shell recursion relations for higher-spin Compton amplitudes,"Yohei Ema,Ting Gao,Wenqi Ke,Zhen Liu,Ishmam Mahbub",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We recursively construct tree-level electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes of higher-spin massive particles by the all-line transverse momentum shift. With three-point amplitude as input, we demonstrate that higher-point electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes are on-shell constructible up to spin $s = 3/2$ and $s = 5/2$, respectively, under the all-line transverse shift after imposing the current constraint condition. We unambiguously derive the four-point electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes for $s \leq 3/2$ and $s \leq 5/2$, which are uniquely determined by the on-shell recursion relation and are free from unphysical spurious poles. In addition, we explore amplitudes of spin-$3/2$ particles with non-minimal three-point interactions with photon, as well as $s > 3/2$ particles, and comment on their notable features. Our work furthers the understanding of on-shell methods for massive amplitudes, with hopes to shed light on physical observables in particle physics and higher-spin amplitudes relevant for Kerr black-hole scattering.",
Cross submissions,Towards a microscopic description of de Sitter dynamics,Vladimir Narovlansky,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Describing dynamics in a gravitational universe with positive cosmological constant, such as de Sitter space, is a conceptually challenging problem. We propose a principle for constructing a quantum system that can potentially be used to study this question. This quantum system describes a heavy object in such a universe interacting with its environment, to which gauge invariant dynamical observables can be anchored. In order to describe gravity with positive cosmological constant, the proposed quantum system needs to agree with all known semiclassical results. We investigate this with a particular microscopic realization constructed using SYK. We first find that correlators match the classical limit of gravity, given by quantum fields in rigid de Sitter space. In particular, the usual UV behavior of quantum fields is surprisingly reproduced by the quantum mechanical system. In order to probe small effects in the gravitational constant, we also consider the intrinsically dynamical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). These correspond to gravitational scattering in the bulk away from the worldline associated with the quantum system. Such OTOCs have highly non-trivial features in de Sitter space, including a Lyapunov exponent which is twice as big as the maximal chaos exponent from the bound on chaos, as well as an unusual behavior of the coefficients in various OTOCs. Interestingly, we find that these features are reproduced by the quantum system.",
Cross submissions,The particle spectra of parity-violating theories: A less radical approach and an upgrade of PSALTer,"Will Barker,Georgios K. Karananas,Haochen Tu",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Due to computational barriers, the effects of parity violation have so far been grossly neglected in gravitational model-building, leading to a serious gap in the space of prior models. We present a new algorithm for efficiently computing the particle spectrum for any parity-violating tensorial field theory. It allows to extract conditions for the absence of massive ghosts without resorting to any manipulation of radicals in cases where the particle masses are irrational functions of the Lagrangian coupling coefficients. We test it against several examples, among which is the most general parity-indefinite Einstein-Cartan/Poincaré gravity that propagates two healthy massive scalars (in addition to the massless graviton). Importantly, we upgrade the PSALTer software in the Wolfram Language to accommodate parity-violating theories. PSALTer is a contribution to the xAct project.",
Cross submissions,Quantum correlation beyond entanglement: Holographic discord and multipartite generalizations,Takato Mori,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of discord, including a holography-inspired one based on multi-entropy. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.",
Cross submissions,Gravitons on Nariai Edges,"Y.T. Albert Law,Varun Lochab",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that, for any $d\geq 3$, the one-loop graviton path integral on $S^2\times S^{d-1}$ factorizes into bulk and edge parts. The bulk equals the thermal partition function of an ideal graviton gas in the Lorentzian Nariai geometry. The edge factor is the inverse of the path integral over two identical copies, each containing one shift-symmetric vector and three shift-symmetric scalars on $S^{d-1}$. Unlike the round $S^{d+1}$ case, all scalars are massless, indicating that graviton edge partition functions probe beyond the horizon's intrinsic geometry - in contrast to $p$-form gauge theories. In the course of this work, we obtain a compact formula for the one-loop Euclidean graviton path integral on any $\Lambda >0$ Einstein manifold.",
Cross submissions,Towards a gravitational network: Bridging metric-affine gravity and no-scale supergravity,"Ioannis D. Gialamas,Theodoros Katsoulas,Kyriakos Tamvakis",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider a class of models in the framework of metric-affine gravity and establish their correspondence to the bosonic sector of a class of no-scale supergravity models. The excellent inflationary behavior of the gravitational models considered is carried over to the corresponding supergravity ones, thus, enriching the landscape of inflation-compatible models.",
Cross submissions,Mixed Solutions to the Liouville Equation,"Sujay K. Ashok,Jan Troost",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),We enlarge the set of explicit classical solutions to the Liouville equation with three singularities to the cases with mixed hyperbolic and elliptic monodromies. We analyze the large hyperbolic monodromy limit of the solutions and the farthest geodesics looping one hyperbolic singularity. These two-dimensional geometries describe a time-symmetric spatial slice of a solution to three-dimensional general relativity. The geodesics are reinterpreted as snapshots of horizons of evolving black holes. We study the spatial slice with three horizons of very heavy black holes in some detail. We use uniform saddle point integration to present the Liouville and heavy black hole geometries in terms of simpler special functions. These make a detailed analysis of mixed particle and black hole geometries possible.,
Cross submissions,A Bayesian PINN Framework for Barrow-Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy with Neutrinos: Toward a Resolution of the Hubble Tension,"Muhammad Yarahmadi,Amin Salehi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the Barrow-Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (BTHDE) model using both traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework, employing a range of cosmological observations. Our analysis incorporates data from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), CMB lensing, Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation. We focus on constraining the Hubble constant $ H_0 $, the nonextensive entropy index $ q $, the Barrow exponent $ \Delta $, and the Granda-Oliveros parameters $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $, along with the total neutrino mass $ \Sigma m_\nu $. The Bayesian PINN approach yields more precise constraints than MCMC, particularly for $ \beta $, and tighter upper bounds on $ \Sigma m_\nu $. The inferred values of $ H_0 $ from both methods lie between those from Planck 2018 and SH$_0$ES (R22), alleviating the Hubble tension to within $ 1.3\sigma $-$2.1\sigma $ depending on the dataset combination. Notably, the Bayesian PINN achieves consistent results across CC and Pantheon+ datasets, while maintaining physical consistency via embedded differential constraints. The combination of CMB and late-time probes leads to the most stringent constraints, with $ \Sigma m_\nu < 0.114 $ eV and $ H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.35 $ km/s/Mpc. These findings suggest that the BTHDE model provides a viable framework for addressing cosmological tensions and probing modified entropy scenarios, while highlighting the complementary strengths of machine learning and traditional Bayesian inference in cosmological modeling.",
Cross submissions,Wheeler-DeWitt equation and Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) symmetry,Marc Henneaux,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Hamiltonian formulation of the BMS symmetry on spacelike hypersurfaces enables one to define its action on solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Using the BRST reformulation of the theory, we provide operator expressions for the matrix elements of the BMS operators between Wheeler-DeWitt states. To that end, we construct the BRST-invariant extensions of the BMS generators, which form a BRST-extension of the BMS algebra.",
Cross submissions,Seeking Spinning Subpopulations of Black Hole Binaries via Iterative Density Estimation,"Jam Sadiq,Thomas Dent,Ana Lorenzo-Medina",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Attempts to understand the formation of binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational wave (GW) emission are affected by many unknowns and uncertainties, from both the observational and theoretical (astrophysical modelling) sides. Binary component spins have been proposed as a means to investigate formation channels, however obtaining clear inferences is challenging, given the apparently low magnitude of almost all merging BH spins and their high measurement uncertainties. Even for the effective aligned spin $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ which is more precisely measured than component spins, specific model assumptions have been required to identify any clear trends. Here, we reconstruct the joint component mass and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distribution of BBH mergers with minimal assumptions using the GWTC-3 catalog, using an iterative kernel density estimation (KDE)-based method. We reproduce some features seen in previous analyses, for instance a small but preferentially positive $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ for low-mass mergers; we also identify a possible subpopulation of higher-spin BBH with $|\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}|$ up to $\sim\! 0.75$ for primary masses $m_1 \gtrsim 40\,M_\odot$, in addition to the bulk of the distribution with $|\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}| \lesssim 0.2$. This finding is consistent with previous studies indicating a broader spin distribution at high mass, suggesting a distinct origin for the high-spin systems. We also identify a previously-unnoticed trend at lower masses: the population mean of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ increases (decreases) with $m_1$ ($m_2$) \emph{within} the overdensity around $m_1 \sim 10 M_\odot$. This ``spin fine structure'' may partly explain a previously reported anticorrelation between mass ratio and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$.",
Cross submissions,Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation,"Hing-Tong Cho,Kin-Wang Ng",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.",
Cross submissions,A short overview on the Black Hole-Tower Correspondence and Species Thermodynamics,"Alvaro Herráez,Dieter Lüst,Joaquin Masias,Carmine Montella",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The breakdown of gravitational effective field theories is intimately connected to the emergence of infinite towers of light states near infinite-distance limits in field space. In string theory, up to duality frame, such towers arise from Kaluza-Klein or weakly-coupled critical string oscillator modes. Motivated by the Black Hole-String Correspondence, we review a broader mechanism whereby black holes undergo a transition into a tower of light states, governed by the Quantum Gravity cutoff -- known as the Species Scale. Building on these developments, the Black Hole-Tower correspondence aims to provide a unified thermodynamic framework that describes black hole entropy in terms of the spectrum of the lightest degrees of freedom across various perturbative regimes of quantum gravity theories. In those regimes, thermodynamic consistency of such transition imposes stringent constraints on the spectrum, in agreement with string theory predictions. This defines the basis of the so-called Species Thermodynamics.In this review, we emphasize these recent advances and synthesize their implications, offering an overview of how the outlined correspondence, the species scale and related thermodynamic principles enhance our understanding of black hole entropy within the effective field theory framework.",
Cross submissions,$\mathcal{N}=1$ Jackiw -Teitelboim supergravity beyond the Schwarzian regime,"H.T. Özer,Aytül Filiz",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We investigate the asymptotic symmetry structure of two--dimensional dilaton gravity in its $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric extension based on the $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ Lie superalgebra. Within the BF theoretical framework, we analyze affine and superconformal boundary conditions for each case and systematically derive the associated asymptotic symmetry algebras. While the classical theory recovers the Virasoro algebra or its affine enhancement, the supersymmetric extension yields a classical $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal algebra, subject to dynamical symmetry breaking mechanisms induced by the dilaton supermultiplet. We find that the boundary behavior of the dilaton not only leads to a reduction of the full affine $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)_k$ symmetry down to $\tt{O} \tt{S} p(1|2)$, but also introduces an abelian extension through commuting modes. These results reveal a novel interplay between symmetry breaking and symmetry extension in low-dimensional supergravity. Our construction generalizes previous analyses of $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ dilaton gravity to the supersymmetric domain and offers a consistent foundation for investigating boundary dynamics beyond the Schwarzian regime.",
Cross submissions,A generalization of the ADM mass for asymptotically Euclidean manifolds of weak regularity,"Stig Lundgren,Benjamin Meco",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a new definition of the ADM mass for asymptotically Euclidean manifolds inspired by the definition of mass for weakly regular asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds by Gicquaud and Sakovich. This version of the mass allows one to work with metrics of local Sobolev regularity $ W^{1,2}_\text{loc} \cap L^\infty $ and we show, under suitable asymptotic assumptions, that the mass is finite, invariant under a change of coordinates at infinity and that it agrees with the classical ADM mass in the smooth setting. We also provide an expression in terms of the Ricci tensor that agrees with the Ricci version of the ADM mass studied by Herzlich.",
Cross submissions,Generalized cones admitting a curvature-dimension condition,"Matteo Calisti,Christian Ketterer,Clemens Sämann",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Metric Geometry (math.MG),"We study (generalized) cones over metric spaces, both in Riemannian and Lorentzian signature. In particular, we establish synthetic lower Ricci curvature bounds à la Lott-Villani-Sturm and Ohta in the metric measure case, and à la Cavalletti-Mondino in Lorentzian signature. Here, a generalized cone is a warped product of a one-dimensional base space, which will be positive or negative definite, over a fiber that is a metric space. We prove that Riemannian or Lorentzian generalized cones over $\mathsf{CD}$-spaces satisfy the (timelike) measure contraction property $\mathsf{(T)MCP}$ - a weaker version of a (timelike) curvature-dimension condition $\mathsf{(T)CD}$. Conversely, if the generalized cone is a $\mathsf{(T)CD}$-space, then the fiber is a $\mathsf{CD}$-space with the appropriate bounds on Ricci curvature and dimension. In proving these results we develop a novel and powerful two-dimensional localization technique, which we expect to be interesting in its own right and useful in other circumstances. We conclude by giving several applications including synthetic singularity and splitting theorems for generalized cones. The final application is that we propose a new definition for lower curvature bounds for metric and metric measure spaces via lower curvature bounds for generalized cones over the given space.",
Cross submissions,Bulk/boundary Modular Quintessence and DESI,"Luis A. Anchordoqui,Ignatios Antoniadis,Niccolò Cribiori,Arda Hasar,Dieter Lust,Joaquin Masias,Marco Scalisi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The latest DESI DR2 results, when combined with other independent cosmological data on the Cosmic Microwave Background and supernovas, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy.We propose a novel cosmological scenario, which features two distinct scalar fields. One governs the magnitude of the present-day dark energy density and is related to the size of extra-dimensions. Accounting for the observed smallness of this energy density requires the scalar to reside near the boundary of field space.The second field, responsible for the time evolution of dark energy and associated with the string coupling, must instead lie in the bulk to remain consistent with the non-observation of light string states. We show that a natural candidate for such dark energy dynamics is a quintessence modular-invariant potential, in which the second scalar field rolls down a negatively curved slope, starting from a self-dual critical point. We find that this scenario is in good agreement with the latest findings by DESI.",

Cross submissions,ModMax Electrodynamics and Holographic Magnetotransport,"José Barrientos,Nicolás Cáceres,Felipe Diaz,Ulises Hernandez-Vera",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study magnetotransport in a holographic model where ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics is coupled to Einstein AdS gravity. To incorporate momentum relaxation, we introduce spatially linear axion fields that break translational symmetry, resulting in an anisotropic medium. Using linear response theory, we compute the DC conductivity matrix in the presence of an external magnetic field, expressing the conductivities in terms of horizon data. Our results demonstrate how the nonlinear ModMax parameter modifies charge transport, particularly influencing the Hall angle and Nernst signal. The nonlinear corrections introduce distinct deviations in both longitudinal and Hall conductivities while preserving the characteristic temperature scaling of strange metals, offering new insights into strongly coupled systems with nonlinear electromagnetic interactions. Notably, the Nernst signal reproduces that of high$-T_c$ cuprate superconductors showing a superconducting dome and a normal phase, with the ModMax deformation parameter tuning critical and onset temperatures. In the strongly nonlinear regime, we find evidence of an exotic state dominated by quasiparticle excitations in the dual material.",
Cross submissions,Probing Dark Matter Spike with Gravitational Waves from Early EMRIs in the Milky Way Center,"Chen Feng,Yong Tang,Yue-Liang Wu",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Cold dark matter may form dense structures around supermassive black holes (SMBHs), significantly influencing their local environments. These dense regions are ideal sites for the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which stellar-mass compact objects gradually spiral into SMBH, emitting gravitational waves (GWs). Space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories such as LISA and Taiji will be sensitive to these signals, including early-stage EMRIs (E-EMRIs) that persist in the low-frequency band for extended periods. In this work, we investigate the impact of dark matter-induced dynamical friction on E-EMRIs in the Milky Way Center, model its effect on the trajectory, and calculate the resulting modifications to the GW spectrum. Our analysis suggests that this influence might be sizable and lead to detectable deviations in the spectrum, namely suppression at low frequencies and enhancement at high frequencies, therefore providing a potential probe for dark matter with future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.",
Cross submissions,Euclid preparation. Constraining parameterised models of modifications of gravity with the spectroscopic and photometric primary probes,Euclid Collaboration,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The Euclid mission has the potential to understand the fundamental physical nature of late-time cosmic acceleration and, as such, of deviations from the standard cosmological model, LCDM. In this paper, we focus on model-independent methods to modify the evolution of scalar perturbations at linear scales. We consider two approaches: the first is based on the two phenomenological modified gravity (PMG) parameters, $\mu_{\rm mg}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm mg}$, which are phenomenologically connected to the clustering of matter and weak lensing, respectively; and the second is the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy and modified gravity, which we use to parameterise the braiding function, $\alpha_{\rm B}$, which defines the mixing between the metric and the dark energy field. We discuss the predictions from spectroscopic and photometric primary probes by Euclid on the cosmological parameters and a given set of additional parameters featuring the PMG and EFT models. We use the Fisher matrix method applied to spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp), weak lensing (WL), photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), and cross-correlation (XC) between GCph and WL. For the modelling of photometric predictions on nonlinear scales, we use the halo model to cover two limits for the screening mechanism: the unscreened (US) case, for which the screening mechanism is not present; and the super-screened (SS) case, which assumes strong screening. We also assume scale cuts to account for our uncertainties in the modelling of nonlinear perturbation evolution. We choose a time-dependent form for $\{\mu_{\rm mg},\Sigma_{\rm mg}\}$, with two fiducial sets of values for the corresponding model parameters at the present time, $\{\bar{\mu}_0,\bar{\Sigma}_0\}$, and two forms for $\alpha_{\rm B}$, with one fiducial set of values for each of the model parameters, $\alpha_{\rm B,0}$ and $\{\alpha_{\rm B,0},m\}$.

Cross submissions,A Complete Survey from the $\texttt{CompactObject}$ Perspective on Equation of State Cross-Comparison Using Observational and Nuclear Experimental Constraints,"João Cartaxo,Chun Huang,Tuhin Malik,Shashwat Sourav,Wen-Li Yuan,Tianzhe Zhou,Xuezhi Liu,Constança Providência",Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This extensive survey seeks to analyze and contrast different phenomenological methods used to model the nuclear equation of state (EOS) for neutron star matter based on covariant energy density functionals (CEDF). Using two complementary methodologies, we seek to capture a comprehensive picture of the potential behaviors of ultra-dense nucleonic matter and identify the most plausible models based on current observational and experimental constraints. Observational data from radio pulsar timing, gravitational wave detection of GW170817, and X-ray timing provide critical benchmarks for testing the models. We have derived the EOS posteriors for various CEDF models within the $\texttt{CompactObject}$ package, utilizing recent observational data on neutron stars, state-of-the-art theoretical constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) calculations for pure neutron matter at low densities, and pQCD-derived constraints at approximately $7 \times 0.16$ $ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$. Our analysis has demonstrated that while all considered CEDF models broadly reproduce current astrophysical and theoretical constraints, subtle yet important differences persist among them, with each framework exhibiting distinct characteristics at supra-nuclear density. This is in particular true for the proton fraction inside neutron stars, but also supported by the models' behavior with respect to the pure neutron matter EOS and the density dependence of the speed of sound. Our study highlights the sensitivity of dense matter predictions to the underlying EOS parameterizations and the priors considered.",
Cross submissions,Self-Dual Electrodynamics via the Characteristic Method: Relativistic and Carrollian Perspectives,"Bin Chen,Song He,Jue Hou",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Electric-magnetic duality plays a pivotal role in understanding the structure of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The Gaillard-Zumino (GZ) criterion provides a powerful constraint for identifying self-dual theories. In this work, we systematically explore solutions to the GZ self-duality condition by applying the method of characteristics, a robust tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach enables the construction of new classes of Lagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and Carrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover well-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify novel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and construct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic models. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an attractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be self-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings broaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for exploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.",
