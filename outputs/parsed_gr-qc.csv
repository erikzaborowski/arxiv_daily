New submissions,On the stability of de Sitter inflationary solution in the Starobinsky-Bel-Robinson gravity,Tuan Q. Do,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We will present the way to derive a de Sitter inflationary solution within the so-called Starobinsky-Bel-Robinson gravity. Then, we will show by using the dynamical system method whether the obtained solution is stable or not. According to the stability of the de Sitter inflationary solution, we could judge which phase of our universe, among the two early and late-time phases, is more appropriate for this solution.",
New submissions,Canonical Electrodynamics in Ashtekar-Barbero variables,"Federica Fragomeno,Saeed Rastgoo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present the full Hamiltonian analysis of electrodynamics, including fermions, photons, and their interaction, on a general curved spacetime in Ashtekar-Barbero variables. No gauge fixing is performed and the theory is background independent. The details of the constraints of the theory for both Weyl and Dirac fermions are presented. Moreover, the equations of motion are derived and it is shown that they reduce to the equations of motion of the standard QFT in curved or flat spacetime in the appropriate limits. Finally, the behavior of the theory under parity transformation is analyzed.",
New submissions,Kilohertz Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Full Spectrum Analyses and High-density Constraints on Neutron Star Matter,"Giulia Huez,Sebastiano Bernuzzi,Matteo Breschi,Rossella Gamba",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We demonstrate Bayesian analyses of the complete gravitational-wave spectrum of binary neutron star mergers events with the next-generation detector Einstein Telescope. Our mock analyses are performed for 20 different signals using the TEOBResumSPA_NRPMw waveform that models gravitational-waves from the inspiral to the postmerger phase. They are employed to validate a pipeline for neutron star's extreme matter constraints with prospective detections and under minimal hypotheses on the equation of state. The proposed analysis stack delivers inferences for the mass-radius curve, the mass dependence of the quadrupolar tidal polarizability parameter, the neutron star's maximum density, the maximum mass and the relative radius, and the pressure-density relation itself. We show that a single event at a signal-to-noise ratio close to the minimum threshold for postmerger detection is sufficient to tightly constrain all the above relations as well as quantities like the maximum mass (maximum density) to precision of ${\sim}6$% (${\sim}10$%) at 90% credibility level. We also revisit inferences of prompt black hole formation with full spectrum signals and find that the latter can be robustly identified, even when the postmerger is not detectable due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. New results on the impact of the initial signal frequency and of the detector configuration (triangular vs. two-L) on the source's parameters estimation are also reported. An improvement of approximately one order of magnitude in the precision of the chirp mass and mass ratio can be achieved by lowering the initial frequency from 20 Hz to 2 Hz. The two-L configuration shows instead significant improvements on the inference of the source declination, due to geographical separation of the two detectors.",
New submissions,"A flexible, GPU-accelerated approach for the joint characterization of LISA instrumental noise and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds","Alessandro Santini,Martina Muratore,Jonathan Gair,Olaf Hartwig",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"LISA data analysis represents one of the most challenging tasks ahead for the future of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Characterizing the instrument's noise properties while fitting for all the other detectable sources is a key requirement of any robust inference pipeline. Noise estimation will also play a crucial role in searches and parameter estimation of cosmological and astrophysical stochastic signals. Previous studies have tackled this topic by assuming perfect knowledge of the spectral shape of the instrumental noise and of different possible types of GW Stochastic Backgrounds (SGWBs), usually resorting to parametrized templates. Recently, various works that employ template-agnostic methods have been presented. In this work, we take an additional step further, introducing flexible spectral shapes in both the instrumental noise and the stochastic signals. We account for the lack of knowledge of the exact shape of the individual contributions to the overall power spectral density by using splines to represent arbitrary perturbations of the noise and signal spectral densities. We implement a data-driven Reversible Jump MCMC algorithm to fit different components simultaneously and to infer the level of flexibility required under different scenarios. We test this approach on simulated LISA data produced under different assumptions. We investigate the impact of this increased flexibility on the reconstruction of both the injected signal and the noise level, and we discuss the prospects for claiming a successful SGWB detection.",
New submissions,A Breathing Universe is Consistent,Samuel Blitz,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider a toy FRW universe with the exotic topology $S^1 \times S^3$. We show that for a specific choice of quantum field content, the semi-classical Friedman equations are consistent with temporal periodicity as required by the $S^1$ timelike factor. A straightforward consequence is that entropy reversals occur during each cycle, consistent with Hawking's proposed connection between the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time.",
New submissions,Electrodynamics in curved spacetime: Gravitationally-induced constitutive equations and the spacetime index of refraction,"F. Masghatian,M. Esfandiar,M. Nouri-Zonoz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Previous studies on spacetime index of refraction are mostly restricted to the static spacetimes. In this study we fill this gap by introducing the refractive index for full stationary spacetimes, employing three different approaches. These include applying Fermat's principle, employing the classical definition of refractive index, and using gravitationally-induced constitutive equations. These calculations are carried out in both threading and slicing spacetime decomposition formalisms, and their equivalence is stablished. We discuss possible applications of the spacetime index of refraction, specially in the study of light trajectories and their characteristics in stationary spacetimes. More specifically we show that there is a gravitational analog of a toroidal moment, and discuss possible gravitational analog of nonreciprocal refraction in materials with a toroidal domain wall.",
New submissions,A proposal for the role of higher spin fields in Conformal Cyclic Cosmology,Anders K. H. Bengtsson,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This paper proposes a research program into how the special properties of the cubic chiral higher spin gravity theory may play a role in conformal cyclic cosmology and black hole physics, in particular for the black hole information paradox. The paper is qualitative, raising a number of questions and connections, that may be interesting to pursue in more detail. The proposal is based on a new -- at least not so commonly expressed -- view on the presumptive role of higher spin gauge fields in fundamental physics. In short, it is proposed that the non-unitary time evolution of the cubic chiral higher spin gravity theory is precisely what is needed for bridging the very large entropy gap between aeons in Roger Penrose's cosmological theory CCC.",
New submissions,On the third law of black hole mechanics for supersymmetric black holes,"Aidan M. McSharry,Harvey S. Reall",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recently it has been shown that the third law of black hole mechanics can be violated: an exactly extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole can form in finite time in gravitational collapse of matter with a large charge to mass ratio. However, it has also been proved that this cannot happen if the matter satisfies a ``supersymmetric'' lower bound on its energy in terms of its charge. This paper proves an analogous result for black holes with a negative cosmological constant. The result states that a supersymmetric Kerr-Newman-anti de Sitter black hole cannot form in gravitational collapse of charged matter satisfying the supersymmetric bound. The results for zero or negative cosmological constant are extended to apply to two-sided black holes: it is proved that an initially non-extremal black hole cannot evolve to a supersymmetric black hole in finite time, irrespective of whether or not the initial black hole was formed in gravitational collapse.",
New submissions,Post-adiabatic waveforms from extreme mass ratio inspirals in the presence of dark matter,"Mostafizur Rahman,Takuya Takahashi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a solar mass compact object is whirling around a supermassive black hole, act as precise tracers of the spacetime geometry and astrophysical environment around the supermassive black hole. These systems are highly sensitive to even the smallest deviations from the vacuum general relativity scenario. However, detecting these signals requires highly accurate waveform modeling up to the first post-adiabatic order, incorporating self-force effects, system parameters, and environmental influences. In this paper, we focus on the impact of dark matter on gravitational waveforms. Cold dark matter in galactic centers can be redistributed by the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, forming a dense, spike-like profile. When an EMRI evolves in such an environment, the interaction between the binary and the surrounding dark matter can leave distinctive imprints on the emitted waveform, and thus offer a novel way to probe the nature and distribution of dark matter. We specifically examine how dark matter modifies the background spacetime. By treating these modifications perturbatively, we present a framework to incorporate dark matter environmental effects into gravitational waveform modeling at the first post-adiabatic order.",
New submissions,Homothetic expansion of polyhedra in the two-vertex model: emergence of FLRW,"Iñaki Garay,Sergio Rodríguez-González,Raül Vera",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The cosmological behavior associated to a U(N)-symmetry reduced sector of the loop-quantum-gravity truncation known as the two-vertex model is further explored in this work. We construct convenient frame bases that encode the whole classical phase space of the twisted geometry associated to the graph. We show that the polyhedra of the twisted geometry suffer under evolution an homothetic expansion, which strengthens the correspondence to the Robertson-Walker geometry.",
New submissions,Early Warning From Eccentric Compact Binaries: Template Initialization And Sub-dominant Mode Effects,"Priyanka Sinha,R. Prasad,Mukesh Kumar Singh,Prayush Kumar,Akash Maurya,Kaushik Paul",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Early warning of gravitational waves (GWs) is essential for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star merger events. In this study, we investigate early warning prospects from eccentric compact binaries, whose mergers are expected to comprise a significant fraction of detected GW events in the future. Eccentric binaries exhibit oscillatory frequency evolution, causing GW frequencies to recur multiple times through their coalescence. Consequently, generating eccentric waveform templates for early warning requires specification of initial conditions. While the standard approach involves initiating waveform generation when the orbit-averaged frequency enters the detector band, we compare this with an alternative approach that uses the periastron frequency as the starting point. Our analysis shows that initializing at the periastron frequency yields an improved signal-to-noise ratio and sky localization. Additionally, including subdominant modes alongside the dominant $(2,2)$ mode leads to further improvements in sky localization. We explore the parameter space of primary mass $m_1 \in [1.4, 15] \, M_\odot$, spin $\chi_1 \in [0, 0.8]$, and eccentricity $e \leq 0.4$ across three detector configurations: O5, Voyager, and 3G. We find that in the O5 (Voyager) configuration, including eccentricity and subdominant modes, the sky localization area can be reduced by $2-80\% (2-85\%)$ at 1000 sq. deg. with increasing eccentricity from $e_5 = 0.1$ to $e_5 = 0.4$, yielding up to $41$ seconds (1 minute) of extra early warning time. For NSBH systems, subdominant modes contribute up to $70$ $(94)\%$ reduction for O5 (Voyager) scenario. In the 3G detector scenario, the sky area reduction due to eccentricity reaches $80\%$ (from $e_{2.5} = 0.1$ to $e_{2.5} = 0.4$) at 100 sq. deg., and subdominant modes enhance the reduction up to $98\%$ for NSBH systems.",
Cross submissions,BV Pushforward of Palatini-Cartan gravity,"Giovanni Canepa,Alberto S. Cattaneo",Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The goal of this note is to show that the standard BV formulation of gravity in the Palatini-Cartan formalism is equivalent, using a BV pushforward, to an AKSZ-like version compatible with BFV data on the boundary.",
Cross submissions,Illuminating Dark Energy with Bright Standard Sirens from Future Detectors,"Samsuzzaman Afroz,Suvodip Mukherjee,Gianmassimo Tasinato",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Understanding the nature and evolution of dark energy (DE) is a central challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the constraining power of bright standard sirens -- gravitational wave (GW) events with electromagnetic counterparts - for probing the DE equation of state as function of redshift. Focusing on future GW observations from next-generation ground-based GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, we perform a comprehensive analysis using simulated binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) events over five years of observation with a $75\%$ duty cycle. We consider three broad classes of DE models: (i) phenomenological parametrizations, specifically the Barboza-Alcaniz extension to the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model; (ii) physically motivated scalar field scenarios, specifically hilltop quintessence; and (iii) evolving dark matter setup in which the matter density evolves as $(1+z)^{3+\alpha}$. For each case, we jointly infer the Hubble constant $H_0$ and model-specific DE parameters from the observed GW luminosity distances and spectroscopic redshifts. Our results demonstrate that bright sirens alone can yield competitive and independent constraints on the time evolution of DE indicating that multi-messenger cosmology has the potential to test a wide range of DE theories, bridging phenomenological and physically motivated models, and paving the way for precision cosmology in the era of GW astronomy.",
Cross submissions,A Lorentzian splitting theorem for continuously differentiable metrics and weights,"Mathias Braun,Nicola Gigli,Robert J. McCann,Argam Ohanyan,Clemens Sämann",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Metric Geometry (math.MG),"We prove a splitting theorem for globally hyperbolic, weighted spacetimes with metrics and weights of regularity $C^1$ by combining elliptic techniques for the negative homogeneity $p$-d'Alembert operator from our recent work in the smooth setting with the concept of line-adapted curves introduced here. Our results extend the Lorentzian splitting theorem proved for smooth globally hyperbolic spacetimes by Galloway -- and variants of its weighted counterparts by Case and Woolgar--Wylie -- to this low regularity setting.",
Cross submissions,Measuring cosmic baryon density with FRB and GW data,"Ji-Guo Zhang,Ji-Yu Song,Ze-Wei Zhao,Wan-Peng Sun,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The dispersion measure (DM) analysis of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) has accounted for all cosmic baryons but remains limited by systematic uncertainties from various parameter degeneracies. We show that the prominent degeneracy between the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) and the Hubble constant ($H_0$) can be disentangled through an independent $H_0$ value uniquely inferred from the absolute luminosity distance measurements of gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain a robust, late-Universe measurement of \ob $=0.0488\pm0.0064$ ($1\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN. Notably, incorporating GW data helps not only avoid biases induced by the $H_0$ tension, but also mitigate those from the parameters of diffuse baryon fraction and DM distribution models. Although the current precision ($\sim 13\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of both FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift cosmology.",
Cross submissions,Constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy,"Sai Wang,Zhi-Chao Zhao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, by combining \emph{Planck} \& ACT \& SPT CMB data with DESI BAO data. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). We also project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \& CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 0.9 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.",
