New submissions,Tidal deformation of black holes in Lovelock gravity,"Chiranjeeb Singha,Sumanta Chakraborty",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It is well established that black holes in four-dimensional, vacuum, general relativity exhibit vanishing static tidal Love numbers, indicating no multipolar response to the external tidal fields in the static limit. This intriguing feature does not extend to higher-dimensional spacetimes within general relativity, where static black holes can possess non-zero static tidal Love numbers (TLNs). In this work, we have examined the tidal deformation of black holes in Lovelock gravity. We find that, in certain cases within pure Lovelock gravity, the static TLN vanishes, extending the four-dimensional result to specific higher-dimensional settings. On the other hand, black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity consistently exhibit non-zero static TLNs, with their magnitude depending on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. Exceptions occur only in certain special cases associated with axial perturbations. These results highlight the sensitivity of the multipolar response of a black hole under tidal field, to the underlying theory of gravity and the spacetime dimensions.",
New submissions,Infrared Extended Uncertainty Principle Corrections and Quintessence-Induced Topology of Reissner-Nordström AdS Black Holes,"Y. Sekhmani,G.G.Luciano,S.N.Gashti,A.Baruah",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a unified topological and geometric analysis of charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes immersed in a quintessence field, incorporating infrared gravitational corrections arising from the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). The latter modifies the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation by introducing a minimal momentum/maximal length scale, which effectively captures long-wavelength quantum gravitational effects relevant to black hole thermodynamics in curved spacetimes. We derive analytic expressions for the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity in terms of the EUP deformation parameter. Furthermore, the inclusion of quintessence, characterized by barotropic indices \(\omega_q = -\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\omega_q = -\frac{1}{3}\), modifies the black hole metric function. By studying the relaxation-time function $\tau(r_h)$, we identify a number of inflection points that depends sensitively on the equation of state parameter of quintessence, indicating a nontrivial impact of the latter on the black hole phase structure. Applying Duan's topological current method to the off-shell free energy, we compute integer-valued winding numbers associated with each thermodynamic critical point. A parallel topological analysis of the photon sphere assigns charges \( \pm 1 \) to individual light rings, showing that quintessence effects can trigger the splitting or merging of photon spheres, while preserving the total exterior topological charge of $-1$.",
New submissions,The non-orientable spacetime of the eternal black hole,Ovidiu Racorean,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We derive the metric of the BTZ black hole for the special case of interchanging the characteristics of space and time coordinates. We maximally extend the geometry of this interior solution and show that the line element is similar to its exterior solution counterpart. Thus, we assign the thermofield double state dual to this interior geometric construction. As a result, we have two independent thermofield double states corresponding to the BTZ metric: one dual to the exterior solution and one dual to the interior solution. In this scenario, considering both thermofield double states as dual to the full BTZ black hole, we evaluate the partition function of the bulk. The partition function represents a non-orientable spacetime. Additionally, we derive a thermofield double-like state that connects in the gravity dual the regions of spacetime with opposite orientations of space and time.",
New submissions,"Exploration of Parameters in f(R,T) Gravity and Comparison with Type Ia Supernovae Data","Vincent R. Siggia,Eric D. Carlson,P. Lee Pryor",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The expansion of the Universe in $f(R,T)$ gravity is studied. We consider functions of the form $f(R,T)=R+\lambda T^\epsilon$ where $\epsilon<1$. We find that for all models with $\epsilon<0$, the Universe transitions to exponential growth at late times, just as it does in the standard cosmological model, which corresponds to $\epsilon=0$. It also fits the type Ia supernova data slightly better than the standard cosmological model, without increasing the number of parameters of the theory. In contrast, the fits for $\epsilon >0$ rapidly become worse than the standard cosmological model.",
New submissions,Future Stability of Tilted Two-Fluid Bianchi I Spacetimes,"Grigorios Fournodavlos,Elliot Marshall,Todd A. Oliynyk",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP),"We establish the nonlinear stability to the future of tilted two-fluid Bianchi I solutions to the Einstein-Euler equations with positive cosmological constant and linear equations of state $p_{(\mathfrak{a})}=K_{(\mathfrak{a})}\rho_{(\mathfrak{a})}$, $\mathfrak{a}\in\{1,2\}$, where $\frac{1}{3}<K_{(\mathfrak{a})}<\frac{5}{7}$.",
New submissions,Semi-analytical Study on the Polarized Images of Black Hole due to Frame Dragging,"Xinyu Wang,Songbai Chen,Minyong Guo,Bin Chen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"An initially retrograde accretion flow is transformed into a prograde configuration before plunging into the black hole, as a result of the frame-dragging effect induced by the black hole's rotation. The polarized image of a black hole shaped by such an accretion flow manifests three distinctive critical locations: the turning point of the flow's primary image, the polarization-flip location on the image plane, and the position of the primary image corresponding to the flow's actual turning point in spacetime. Due to the influences of gravitational lensing and gravitational Faraday rotation, these three positions generally do not coincide. In this work, we examine a thin equatorial accretion disk composed of initially retrograde, geodesically moving flows, and conduct a systematic investigation into the interrelations and discrepancies among these critical locations. We elucidate the spatial hierarchy among the three, and for an on-axis observer, we derive approximate analytic expressions characterizing their positions.",
New submissions,Future stability of solutions of the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field system with decelerated expansion,Louie Bernhardt,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"We study solutions to the Einstein equations coupled to a nonlinear scalar field with exponential potential. This system admits Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker solutions undergoing decelerated expansion, with $\mathbb{T}^3$ spatial topology and scale factor $a(t) = t^p$ for $1/3 < p < 1$. For each $p \in (2/3,1)$, we prove that the corresponding FLRW spacetime is future-stable as a solution to the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field system. Given initial data on a spacelike hypersurface that is sufficiently close to the FLRW data, we show the resulting solution is future-causal geodesically complete, and remains close to the FLRW solution for all time. Moreover, we show the perturbed metric components and scalar field converge to spatially homogeneous functions as $t \rightarrow \infty$. A key feature of our analysis is the decomposition of the metric and scalar field perturbations into their spatial averages and oscillatory remainders with zero average.",
New submissions,More on Bianchi I spacetimes and f(T) gravity,"Alexey Golovnev,Mustafa M. Hemida",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Bianchi I cosmological solutions in f(T) gravity are discussed. We start from diagonal metrics and tetrads and show that their dynamical equations are pretty much tractable analytically, with a possible arena for physical applications. Then we derive a very bad unpredictability of the teleparallel connection in these configurations. Namely, even for the simple isotropic Friedmann universes, one might apply an arbitrary time-dependent spatial rotation to the standard tetrad without changing anything in the cosmological equations.",
New submissions,Binary black hole population inference combining confident and marginal events from the $\tt{IAS\text{-}HM}$ search pipeline,"Ajit Kumar Mehta,Digvijay Wadekar,Isha Anantpurkar,Javier Roulet,Tejaswi Venumadhav,Tousif Islam,Jonathan Mushkin,Barak Zackay,Matias Zaldarriaga",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present the population properties of binary black hole mergers identified by the $\tt{IAS\text{-}HM}$ pipeline (which incorporates higher-order modes in the search templates) during the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) detectors. In our population inference analysis, instead of only using events above a sharp cut based on a particular detection threshold (e.g., false alarm rate), we use a Bayesian framework to consistently include both marginal and confident events. We find that our inference based solely on highly significant events ($p_{\mathrm{astro}} \sim 1$) is broadly consistent with the GWTC-3 population analysis performed by the LVK collaboration. However, incorporating marginal events into the analysis leads to a preference for stronger redshift evolution in the merger rate and an increased density of asymmetric mass-ratio mergers relative to the GWTC-3 analysis, while remaining within its allowed parameter ranges. Using simple parametric models to describe the binary black hole population, we estimate a merger rate density of $32.4^{+18.5}_{-12.2}\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at redshift $z = 0.2$, and a redshift evolution parameter of $\kappa = 4.4^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$. Assuming a power-law form for the mass ratio distribution ($\propto q^{\beta}$), we infer $\beta = 0.1^{+1.9}_{-1.4}$, indicating a relatively flat distribution. These results highlight the potential impact of marginal events on population inferences and motivate future analyses with data from upcoming observing runs.",
New submissions,Husain-Kuchař model as the Carrollian limit of the Holst term,"J. Fernando Barbero G.,Juan Margalef-Bentabol,Aitor Vicente-Cano,Eduardo J.S. Villaseñor",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),We show how the Husain-Kuchař model can be understood as a Carrollian limit of the Holst term in the context of background-independent field theories described in terms of coframes and spin connections. We also discuss the footprint of the Carrollian symmetry in the Hamiltonian formulation of the Husain-Kuchař action.,
New submissions,Thermodynamics of the Reissner-Nordström black hole with quintessence matter on the EGUP framework,"Hao Chen,Bekir Can Lütfüoğlu,Hassan Hassanabadi,Zheng-Wen Long",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we investigate the quantum correction on thermodynamics of the Reissner-Nordström black hole in the presence of the quintessence matter associated with dark energy. To this end, the modified Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and entropy functions of the black hole are derived. { Investigation reveals that the modified uncertainty principles and normalization factor $\alpha$ restrict the lower bound value of horizon radius to affect the Hawking temperature and the parameter $\eta_{0}$ have a non-negligible effect on the heat capacity threshold.} {Furthermore}, the correction of entropy does not depend on the quintessence matter. It is also examined the equation of state associated with the pressure and the volume in this framework. In addition, we employ graphical methods to compare and discuss the findings within the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and extended uncertainty principle (EUP).",
New submissions,Radial Oscillations of Scalar Hair in Black Hole Bombs,"Lang Zhao,Lin Chen,Cheng-Yong Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent research has revealed a novel nonlinear mechanism, distinct from the linear superradiant instability, which triggers the black hole bomb phenomenon. Introducing a massive complex scalar field with nonlinear self-interactions drives the Reissner-Nordström black hole to shed substantial energy, thereby triggering a black hole bomb. Radial oscillations in the scalar hair profile are observed during this process. In this paper, we further reveal that physical quantities associated with scalar hair exhibit identical oscillation patterns during the evolution of the black hole-scalar field system. Moreover, the oscillation frequency exhibits a linear dependence on the gauge coupling constant of the scalar field with other parameters fixed. Meanwhile, the horizon radius of hairy black holes and the mass within the horizon increase monotonically with the gauge coupling constant. We have also identified a critical initial charge value that distinguishes hairy solutions that trigger black hole bombs from those that do not.",
New submissions,Black hole spectroscopy of collapsing and merging neutron stars,"Oliver Steppohn,Sebastian H. Völkel,Tim Dietrich",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Black hole spectroscopy is an important pillar when studying gravitational waves from black holes and enables tests of general relativity. Most of the gravitational-wave signals observed over the last decade originate from binary black hole systems. Binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star systems are rarer but of particular interest for the next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. These events offer the exciting possibility of studying matter effects on the ringdown of ""dirty black holes"". In this work, we ask the question: Does matter matter? Using numerical-relativity, we simulate a wide range of collapsing neutron stars producing matter environments, both in isolated scenarios and in binary mergers. Qualitatively, the resulting ringdown signals can be classified into ""clean"", ""modified"", and ""distorted"" cases, depending on the amount of matter that is present. We apply standard strategies for extracting quasinormal modes of clean signals, using both theory-agnostic and theory-specific assumptions. Even in the presence of matter, possible modifications of quasinormal modes seem to be dominated by ringdown modeling systematics. We find that incorporating multiple quasinormal modes allows one to drastically reduce mismatches and errors in estimating the final black hole mass at early times. If not treated carefully, deviations in the fundamental quasinormal mode might artificially be overestimated and falsely attributed to the presence of matter or violations of general relativity.",
New submissions,Constraints on the Sen black hole mass and charge from quasi-periodic oscillations,"Kuantay Boshkayev,Marco Muccino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze quasi-periodic oscillation data from selected X-ray binary systems hosting black holes. To model the spacetime geometry, we resort the static Sen solution -- originally derived in the framework of heterotic string theory -- which reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime for vanishing electric charge. By fitting the observed frequencies within the relativistic precession model, we constrain the mass and charge parameters of the Sen black hole and discuss their astrophysical implications, particularly in distinguishing classical black holes from their string-inspired counterparts.",
New submissions,Energy conditions for regular black holes in EFT of gravity,"Ziyue Zhu,Alexey S. Koshelev,Yang Liu,Anna Tokareva",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"As Einstein's gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, it can be a good description of physics only at the scales of energy or spacetime curvature below the Planck mass. Moreover, it requires the presence of an infinite tower of higher-derivative corrections, as required in the framework of effective field theory (EFT). Black holes, known to be vacuum solutions in Einstein's gravity, necessarily have singularities in the center, where both Einstein's gravity and low-energy EFT expansions break down. In this work, we address the question of whether, in the presence of matter, regular solutions looking like black holes from outside do exist. We show that the matter distribution supporting the regular black hole solution in the presence of Riemann tensor cube and Riemann tensor to the fourth power EFT corrections satisfies positivity of energy (also called weak energy condition, WEC) and null energy condition (NEC) everywhere outside the horizon. Unlike the case of singular solutions, the EFT description is also valid in the interior of such an object, given that the maximal curvature is bounded and does not exceed the cut-off scale. We found that in a wide range of parameters, WEC is satisfied inside the horizon, but NEC is violated inside the horizon in all cases.",
Cross submissions,Classical constant electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter,"Mar Bastero-Gil,Paulo B. Ferraz,António Torres Manso,Lorenzo Ubaldi,Roberto Vega-Morales",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study constant classical electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter space, with potential implications for magnetogenesis and inflationary dark matter production. Treating the photon as a dynamical field, we show that sustaining a constant electric field in de Sitter requires a tachyonic photon mass of order the Hubble scale. This observation has physical implications, as it alters the infrared behaviour of the induced Schwinger current. Using an on-shell renormalization condition consistent with a tachyonic photon, we recompute the current for charged fermions and scalars, finding it to be finite and positive even in the massless limit of the charge carriers-contrary to earlier results predicting a puzzling negative IR divergence. For scalars, we include a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci curvature, enabling us to analyze the conformal limit, where the current closely matches that of charged fermions.",
Cross submissions,Contextuality from the vacuum,"Caroline Lima,María Rosa Preciado-Rivas,Sanchit Srivastava",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, is a phenomenon where the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, violating the premise of classical hidden variable descriptions of the theory. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information, highlighting it as a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum.",
Cross submissions,Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $ΔN_{eff}$ Bounds,"Ido Ben-Dayan,Utkarsh Kumar,Amresh Verma",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $>3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.",
Cross submissions,Interaction of polytropic dark energy in cosmological model: Constraints from observational data,"Elangbam Chingkheinganba Meetei,S. Surendra Singh",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate an interacting polytropic dark energy (PDE) model characterised by the equation of state $p_{d} = \alpha \rho_{d}^{\,1+\frac{1}{\beta}}$, where the interaction between dark energy and pressureless matter is modelled via a linear coupling term $Q = 3\eta H\rho_{d}$. The background dynamics are formulated by deriving the Hubble parameter in the interacting scenario, and the model parameters are constrained through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three joint observational data sets: Hubble77+BAO26, Hubble77+Pantheon$^+$, and Hubble77+BAO26+DESI DR2. The resulting best-fit values of $(H_0, \Omega_{d0}, \eta) $ are $(69.22^{+1.27}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.22^{+0.10}_{-0.12})$, $(69.23^{+1.27}_{-1.22},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.34^{+0.15}_{-0.17})$, and $(67.77^{+1.26}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,\\-0.02^{+0.10}_{-0.11})$ respectively for the respective data combinations. Our results indicate a positive energy density and negative pressure over the full redshift range, with the evolution of the equation-of-state parameter and state finder parameters placing the model firmly within the Quintessence regime. The study of the deceleration parameter also reveals a shift from a decelerating to an accelerating cosmic expansion. The estimated present age of the Universe is $14\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, consistent with recent observational data. Furthermore, the sign of $Q$ implies a current energy transfer from dark energy to matter. These findings support the interacting PDE framework as a viable candidate for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration and related large-scale dynamics.",
Cross submissions,Lorentzian Cheeger-Gromov convergence and temporal functions,"Saúl Burgos,José L. Flores,Miguel Sánchez",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Uniqueness (up to isometries) and existence of limits are analyzed in the context of Cheeger-Gromov convergence of spacetimes. To face the non-compactness of the vector isometry group in the semi-Riemanian setting, standard \em{pointed} convergence is strenghtened to \em{anchored} convergence (which requires the convergence of a timelike direction in the Lorenzian case). Then, a local isometry between the neighborhoods of the basepoints is found, and extended globally under geodesic completeness and simple connectedness. In spacetimes, by using Cauchy temporal functions as both strengthenings of the anchor and tools to ``Wick rotate'' metrics, a new notion of convergence for globally hyperbolic spacetimes (including the case of timelike boundaries) is introduced. The machinery of Riemannian Cheeger-Gromov theory becomes applicable after revisiting the tools related to time functions and studying their connections with Sormani-Vega null distance. In particular, several results with interest on its own right are obtained such as: time functions are locally Lipschitz up to rescaling, global and local characterizations of $h$-steep functions, independence of steepness and $h$-steepness for temporal functions, compatibility of both conditions for Cauchy temporal functions, and the stability of the latter.",
Cross submissions,Emergent classical gravity as stress-tensor deformed field theories,"Yun-Ze Li,Yunfei Xie,Song He",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We introduce a framework in which classical gravity arises from stress-tensor deformations of quantum field theories (QFTs). By expressing the deformed partition function as a gravitational path integral, we propose an equivalent description between a seed QFT coupled to gravity and an effective field theory defined on a deformation-induced metric. This approach, which does not rely on holography or extra dimensions, applies to a variety of gravitational models, including Einstein and Palatini gravity. The deformation parameter acts as a coupling to the emergent geometry, linking stress-energy dynamics to spacetime curvature. The framework provides a calculable, dimension-independent method for studying gravitational theories resulting from QFT deformations.",

The combined spectrophotometry is dominated by features due to water ice absorption and CO2 gas emission. A bright, 3 arcmin radius CO2 gas coma was clearly resolved, corresponding to Qgas,CO2 = 9.4 x 10{^26} molec/sec. From the SPHEREx photometry, we put conservative, preliminary 3sigma upper limits on the gas production rates for H2O and CO of 1.5 x 10{^26} and 2.8 x 10{^26} molec/sec. No obvious jet, tail, or trail structures were found in SPHEREx images. Assuming all observed 1-um flux is scattered light from an pv = 0.04 albedo spherical nucleus, its radius would be 23 km. Compared to the nucleus size limit r = 2.8km of Jewitt+ 2025, this suggests that greater than 99 percent of the measured SPHEREx continuum flux is from coma dust.",

Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here we present our work on quantum control of a nitrogen-vacancy spin system in bulk diamonds and in levitated diamonds as a step towards Stern-Gerlach interferometry with levitated nanodiamonds. Our simulations show that the current state of the art for spin coherence time in nanodiamonds of a few tens of microseconds, is good enough to enable an SGI spatial splitting on the order of nanometers for an ND composed of 10^7 atoms.

Cross submissions,Using gravitational wave dark sirens to choose between host galaxy weighting models,"Zhuotao Li,Rachel Gray,Ik Siong Heng",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Binary black hole (BBH) mergers,, an important source of gravitational-waves(GWs), are assumed to be hosted in galaxies. The probability of a galaxy to host a BBH is related to its properties, for example stellar mass and star formation rate. These properties can be estimated from observables, such as the luminosity in certain observation bands. We refer to this description of host galaxy properties as host galaxy weighting models. However, the host galaxy weighting model for BBHs has yet to be accurately determined. Population synthesis has provided a variety of host galaxy weighting models. Here we investigate whether it is possible to distinguish different host galaxy weighting models using a data driven approach. We use the GW cosmology tool gwcosmo with a simulated IGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) fifth observing run (O5)-like observing scenario. We also construct a mock spectroscopic galaxy catalogue from MICECATv2. Our analysis compares the Bayes factors among three simple luminosity weighting models, r-band, g-band, and uniform weighting. The Bayes factors among different host galaxy weighting models show a minor preference for the true model for a ~200-detection case, and a decisive preference for the true model over the uniform model for a ~1000-detection case, which is strongly driven by a small number of well-localised events.",
Cross submissions,"Cosmological pole-skipping, shock waves and quantum chaotic dynamics of de Sitter horizons","Yongjun Ahn,Sašo Grozdanov,Hyun-Sik Jeong,Juan F. Pedraza",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a systematic analysis of pole-skipping for scalar, Maxwell, and gravitational waves in cosmological spacetimes. Specifically, working in empty de Sitter space and in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole geometries, we locate the tower of pole-skipping points of such fields and show that they impose nontrivial constraints on the corresponding bulk two-point functions. Focusing on the gravitational sound channel, we then extract the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocities that characterize hypothetical dual many-body quantum chaos at each horizon. These chaotic data precisely match the outcome of a gravitational shock wave calculation, confirming that the relevant pole-skipping points encode high-energy scattering of horizon quanta. Interestingly, the butterfly velocities can become superluminal or imaginary, with the latter signaling a spatially modulated propagation of chaos. Assuming that a holographic dual exists, we translate our results into field theory language and propose that the dual theory can be divided into two entangled sectors that capture the black hole and cosmological horizon degrees of freedom. Our results suggest that the black hole sector becomes increasingly nonlocal as the black hole shrinks and that the cosmological horizon sector exhibits behavior compatible with violations of Hermiticity. Finally, we outline simple microscopic toy models, built from long-range and non-Hermitian deformations of the Double Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK)-type chains, that realize these features, providing a concrete arena for future exploration.",
Cross submissions,Extrapolating the massive fields to future timelike infinity,"Wen-Bin Liu,Jiang Long",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It is well-known that future timelike infinity ($i^+$) in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is conformal to the unit three-dimensional hyperboloid ($H^3$). We asymptotically expand massive fields with spin $0,1,2$ near $i^+$ and extrapolate them onto this hyperboloid. These fields oscillate with a frequency equal to their mass and exhibit a universal asymptotic decay $\tau^{-3/2}$. The fundamental fields are free and encode the outgoing scattering data. They are local operators defined on the boundary $H^3$ with which we construct the Poincaré charges. The Poincaré algebra can be extended to $\text{MDiff}(H^3)\ltimes C^{\infty}(H^3)$ using smeared operators associated with energy and angular momentum densities. For spinning fields, a spin operator must be included to close the algebra. The extended algebra shares the same form as the five-dimensional intertwined Carrollian diffeomorphism and reduces to the BMS algebra at $i^+$ by restricting the choice of test functions and vectors.",
Cross submissions,Formation of heavy double neutron stars I: Eddington-limited accretion for a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star at solar metallicity,"Ashwathi Nair,Simon Stevenson",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"More than 30 Galactic double neutron star (DNS) binaries have now been identified through radio pulsar timing. The 24 DNSs in the Galactic field with measured total masses lie in the narrow range of 2.3--2.9 $M_{\odot}$. In contrast, gravitational-wave observations have detected two DNS mergers: GW170817, with a total mass of 2.7 $M_{\odot}$, and GW190425, with a significantly higher mass of 3.4 $M_{\odot}$. The unusually high mass of GW190425 suggests a non-standard formation channel not represented in the known Galactic population. To investigate the origin of such a massive DNS system, we model the late evolutionary stages of helium stars with initial masses between 2.5 and 9.8 $M_{\odot}$ in binaries with 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star companions, using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA at solar metallicity. We test alternative formation pathways and calibrate our models to reproduce the observed Galactic DNS mass and orbital distributions. By incorporating a modified natal kick prescription, our population synthesis results are broadly consistent with the observed total mass distribution of known DNS systems. Only a small fraction of DNSs of our model have total masses $\geq$ 3 $M_{\odot}$, insufficient to explain the high rate of massive DNS mergers inferred from GW observations. However, our model rules out the formation of heavy DNS systems like GW190425 via the second unstable mass transfer.",

We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community.In this work we demonstrate the neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds using ultraviolet photoemission, and characterize the dependence of this process on both the illumination wavelength and particle size. Furthermore, we demonstrate discrete, single-electron charge manipulation of levitated nanodiamond in a needle Paul trap at a pressure of 0.5\,Torr. Finally, we demonstrate fast neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds, achieving a neutralization rate much faster than the state of the art. As neutralization is crucial to avoid spatial decoherence, this constitutes a significant step towards the realization of a nanodiamond spatial interferometer. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.",
