New submissions,Canonical Quantization of Spherically Symmetric Einstein-Scalar Field Solutions,Jiří Černý,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate canonical quantization of a general spherically symmetric spacetimes with a massless scalar-field source and examine the associated constraint algebra. The spacetimes are quantized using Dirac's quantization method for constrained systems, producing a set of Wheeler-DeWitt equations. A general solution for some of these equations, specifically the momentum constraint, is found and discussed. A complete solution to the whole set of equations (namely the Hamiltonian constraint) remains yet to be found, however. A full solution can be recovered for a static version of these spacetimes.",
New submissions,Strong lensing by GUP-improved black holes,"Javier Chagoya,I. Díaz-Saldaña,Benito Rodríguez,Wilfredo Yunpanqui",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We employ Bozza's method to calculate the deflection angle of light in the presence of the strong gravitational field generated by an improved Schwarzschild-like black hole whose metric, regular throughout the entire spacetime, was derived using the improved Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). This framework incorporates effective quantum gravity corrections that resolve the physical singularity inside the black hole, quantified by a model parameter $\vert \tilde{Q}_{c}\vert$. In addition, the event horizon, the photon sphere, and the shadow radius receive modifications characterized by a second model parameter $\tilde{Q}_{b}$. Using observational properties of the supermassive black holes Messier~87$\ast$ and Sagittarius~A$\ast$ reported by the Event Horizon Telescope, we derive constraints on the parameter $\vert \tilde{Q}_{b}\vert$, namely $0 \leq \vert \tilde{Q}_{b}\vert \leq 0.3$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first constraints reported in the literature for this improved GUP parameter. Since $\vert \tilde{Q}_{c}\vert$ does not play a significant role in the correction of the shadow radius, it was not possible to impose restrictions on its allowed values. However, it is important to consider a non-zero $\vert \tilde{Q}_{c}\vert$ in order to avoid a black hole singularity.",
New submissions,Error quantification and comparison of binary neutron star gravitational waveforms from numerical relativity codes,"Sarah Habib,Elias R. Most,Nils Deppe,Francois Foucart,Mark A. Scheel,Saul Teukolsky,Michael Boyle,Matthew Duez,Larry Kidder,Jordan Moxon,Kyle C. Nelli,Harald Pfeiffer,William Throwe,Nils Vu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Future gravitational wave detections of merging binary neutron star systems have the possibility to tightly constrain the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. In order to extract such constraints, gravitational waveform models need to be calibrated to accurate numerical relativity simulations of the late inspiral and merger. In this work, we take an essential step toward classifying the error and potential systematics in current generation numerical relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars. To this end, we perform a direct comparison of two codes (FIL, SpEC), which differ in many aspects, including the numerical methods and discretizations used and equations solved. We find that despite these different approaches, the codes are -- within current numerical resolution bounds -- fully consistent, and broadly comparable in cost for a given accuracy level. Our results indicate that the error in the waveforms is primarily dominated by the hydrodynamic evolution, consistent with earlier findings in the literature. We also discuss current limitations and cost estimates for numerical relativity simulations to reach the accuracies required in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.",
New submissions,Mass and distance of AGN black holes from warped accretion disks,"Adriana González-Juárez,Alfredo Herrera-Aguilar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Along the last ten years, a general relativistic method has been developed to generate analytical expressions for the black hole (BH) parameters in terms of observations, namely the frequency shift of photons emitted by orbiting test particles and their positions on the sky. Applications of the method to astrophysical systems such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), in particular to megamaser systems orbiting the central BH on their flat accretion disks, showed a coupling behavior in the mass-to-distance ratio $M/D$. Estimates for the ratio $M/D$ of a sample of BHs hosted at the core of several AGNs have been performed in recent years with the help of this method. However, both analytical expressions and statistical estimations depend only on the $M/D$ ratio rather than on independent parameters. It is of current general interest to work with decoupled parameters in order to safeguard the intrinsic physical information encoded in each of them, given their high scientific relevance in understanding the structure of our Universe. The purpose of this work is to find analytical expressions for the mass and distance of a Schwarzschild BH in terms of astrophysical observations by introducing a slight warping in the accretion disk of the orbiting megamasers. As a result, independent analytical formulas for the mass and distance of AGN supermassive BHs are presented in terms of astrophysical observations: maser frequency shifts, disk parameters, and the galaxy's peculiar redshift.",
New submissions,Vector Horndeski black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics,"Che-Yu Chen,Antonio De Felice,Shinji Tsujikawa,Taishi Sano",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"On a spherically symmetric and static background, we study the existence of linearly stable black hole (BH) solutions in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) with a Horndeski vector-tensor (HVT) coupling, with and without curvature singularities at the center ($r=0$). Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$ and the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist only if $q_M = 0$. We then study the stability of purely electric BHs by analyzing the behavior of perturbations in the metric and the vector field. Nonsingular electric BHs are unstable due to a Laplacian instability in the vector perturbation near the regular center. In the absence of the HVT coupling ($\beta=0$), singular BHs in power-law NED theories can be consistent with all linear stability conditions, while Born-Infeld BHs encounter strong coupling due to a vanishing propagation speed as $r \to 0$. In power-law NED and Born-Infeld theories with $\beta \neq 0$, the electric fields for singular BHs are regular near $r=0$, while the metric functions behave as $\propto r^{-1}$. Nevertheless, we show that Laplacian instabilities occur for regions inside the outer horizon $r_h$, unless the HVT coupling constant $\beta$ is significantly smaller than $r_h^2$. For $\beta \neq 0$, we also reconstruct the NED Lagrangian so that one of the metric functions takes the Reissner-Nordström form. In this case, there exists a branch where all squared propagation speeds are positive, but the ghost and strong coupling problems are present around the BH center. Thus, the dominance of the HVT coupling generally leads to BH instability in the high-curvature regime.",
New submissions,The characteristics of circular motion and quasiperiodic oscillations around accelerating black hole,"Tao-Tao Sui,Xin-Yang Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"{This study explores the motion of massive test particles and associated quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) around an accelerating black hole. The acceleration factor $A$ suppresses the radial effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}$, thereby lowering the energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$ required for stable circular orbits. Stability demands $\partial_r^2 V_{\text{eff}} \geq 0$, setting an upper bound $AM$ $\leq 0.0161$. As $A$ increases, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius grows, while $L_{\text{ISCO}}$ and $E_{\text{ISCO}}$ decrease. Radiative efficiency $\epsilon$ rises with $A$, peaking at $6.9\%$. Fundamental frequencies show that $A$ accelerates the decay of the Keplerian $\Omega_{\phi}$ and vertical $\Omega_{\theta}$ frequencies, while suppressing the radial frequency. The divergence between $\Omega_{\theta}$ and $\Omega_{\phi}$ increases with $A$, differing from spherical black hole behavior. Using the RP, ER3, ER4, and WD QPO models, the WD model predicts the highest frequencies. The resonant radius of ER4 model remains fixed across frequency ratios, unlike ER3. Although $A$ suppresses twin-peak QPO frequencies, it enhances the nodal precession frequency $\nu_{\text{nod}}$. Fitting observational data from GRO J1655-40 and XTE J1859+226 and applying the TOV limit, the ER4 model uniquely fits GRO J1655-40 with $(10^3A, M, r/M) \approx (4.31, 3.43 M_\odot, 8.08)$. For XTE J1859+226, three models yield $10^3A \approx 1.4$, excluding ER3, suggesting stronger acceleration in GRO J1655-40.}",
New submissions,Echoes from the Minkowski-core spacetime,"Dan Zhang,Qin Tan,Guoyang Fu,Huajie Gong,Jian-Pin Wu,Qiyuan Pan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this study, we construct a class of horizonless exotic compact objects (ECOs) with Minkowski core, classifying them as either photon sphere ECOs (PS ECOs) or photon sphere lacking ECOs (PL ECOs) based on photon sphere topology. Time domain analysis reveals that the dynamical evolution can be divided into three phases: the initial ringdown, the echo phase, and the final ringdown. The echo signals exhibit the periodic damping, with quantum effects significantly accelerating the echo dissipation and prompting an earlier transition to the long lived mode dominated phase. Furthermore, the QNM spectrum of the PS ECO exhibits fundamentally different behavior from that of BHs including the presence of long lived modes and the absence of overtone outbursts providing a clear spectroscopic signature distinguishing PS ECOs from BHs. This work is significant in providing new theoretical foundations and waveform features for identifying such quantum corrected ECOs, contributing critically to the understanding of quantum gravity effects.",
New submissions,Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a novel regular black hole,"Huajie Gong,Sheng Long,Xi-Jing Wang,Zhongwu Xia,Jian-Pin Wu,Qiyuan Pan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO and Virgo has ushered in a new era of strong-field tests of general relativity. We explore potential quantum gravity signatures by studying periodic orbits and their GW emissions around a novel regular black hole featuring a Minkowski core. Using a rational number $q$, periodic orbits are classified, revealing that the deviation parameter $\alpha_0$ reshapes the bound-orbit region while preserving characteristic ""zoom-whirl"" structures. Numerical kludge waveforms reveal detectable phase shifts and amplitude modulations induced by quantum gravity effects. Faithfulness analysis demonstrates that larger $\alpha_0$ and $q$ enhance distinguishability from the Schwarzschild case, suggesting that large-$q$ periodic orbits in extreme mass ratio inspirals serve as sensitive probes for quantum gravity effects.",
New submissions,ACT Constraints on Marginally Deformed Starobinsky Inflation,"Jureeporn Yuennan,Farruh Atamurotov,Phongpichit Channuie",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the inflationary phenomenology of a marginally deformed Starobinsky model, motivated by quantum corrections to the $R^{2}$ term, in light of the latest cosmological observations. In this framework, the inflationary potential acquires a small deformation parameter, $\gamma$, which shifts predictions away from the exact Starobinsky limit. Using the slow-roll formalism, we derive analytic expressions for the spectral index $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and confront them with constraints from Planck, ACT, and DESI data. Our analysis shows that nonzero values of $\gamma$ raise both $n_{s}$ and $r$, thereby alleviating the $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ tension between the Starobinsky $R^{2}$ scenario and the ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) measurements, which favor $n_{s} \simeq 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$. For $N \sim 60$ $e$-foldings, the model consistently reproduces the observed amplitude of primordial perturbations while predicting tensor contributions within current observational bounds. We also demonstrate that the deformation softens the otherwise severe fine-tuning of the quartic self-coupling in minimally coupled inflation. The parameter range $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$-$\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ emerges as phenomenologically viable, providing a natural extension of Starobinsky inflation compatible with present data. We conclude that marginally deformed $R^{2}$ inflation remains a compelling and testable candidate for the primordial dynamics of the Universe, with future CMB and gravitational-wave observations expected to further probe its parameter space.",
New submissions,Black hole spectral instability triggered by deterministic and random metric perturbations,"Shui-Fa Shen,Guan-Ru Li,Ramin G. Daghigh,Jodin C. Morey,Michael D. Green,Wei-Liang Qian,Rui-Hong Yue",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Owing to its substantial implications for black hole spectroscopy, spectral instability has attracted considerable attention in the literature. While the emergence of such instability is attributed to the non-Hermitian nature of the gravitational system, it remains sensitive to various factors. About the spatial scale of the metric deformation, spectral instability is particularly susceptible to ``ultraviolet'' metric perturbations. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of black hole spectral instability triggered by random and deterministic metric perturbations. We investigate the dependence on the magnitude, spatial scale, and localization of the metric perturbations in the Pöschl-Teller effective potential, and discuss the underlying physical interpretations. It is observed that small metric perturbations initially have a limited impact on the less damped black hole quasinormal modes, and deviations typically around their unperturbed values, a phenomenon first derived by Skakala and Visser in a more restrictive context. In the higher overtone region, the deformation propagates, amplifies, and eventually gives rise to spectral instability and, inclusively, bifurcation in the quasinormal mode spectrum. While deterministic metric perturbations give rise to a deformed but well-defined quasinormal spectrum, random perturbations lead to uncertainties in the resulting spectrum. Nonetheless, the primary trend of the spectral instability remains consistent, being sensitive to both the strength and location of the perturbation. However, we demonstrate that the observed spectral instability might be suppressed for metric perturbations that are physically appropriate.",
New submissions,Adiabatic and point-splitting regularization of spin-1/2 field in de Sitter space,"Xuan Ye,Yang Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the regularization of a spin-1/2 fieldin the vacuum state in de Sitter space. We find that the 2nd order adiabatic regularization is sufficient to remove all UV divergences for the spectral stress tensor, as well as for the power spectrum. The regularized vacuum stress tensors of the massive field is maximally symmetric with the energy density remaining negative, and behaves as a ``negative"" cosmological constant. In the massless limit it reduces smoothly to the zero stress tensor of the massless field, and there is no trace anomaly. We also perform the point-splitting regularization in coordinate space, and obtain the analytical, regularized correlation function and stress tensor, which agree with those from the adiabatic regularization. In contrast, the 4th order regularization is an oversubtraction, and changes the sign of the vacuum energy density. In the massless limit the 4th order regularized auto-correlation becomes singular and the regularized stress tensor does not reduce to the zero stress tensor of the massless field. These difficulties tell that the 4th order regularization is inadequate for the spin-1/2 massive field.",
New submissions,Null integrability and photon phenomenology in the accelerated Schwarzschild black hole,"Shokoufe Faraji,Eva Hackmann",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this study we analyse null geodesics in an accelerated Schwarzschild black hole sustained by a cosmic string/strut (C-metric) in the sub-extremal regime. Using dimensionless variables and a Mino-type parameter we cast the equations into a complete first order form. For photons the conformal Hamilton-Jacobi equation separates and the radial and polar motion reduce to Bierman-Weierstrass form, yielding new closed analytic solutions. This provides a clean classification of photon trajectories, identifies a fixed photon cone that replaces equatorial symmetry when the acceleration is nonzero, and locates a single spherical photon surface shared by all latitudes. On the observational side, we prove that the shadow seen by any static observer is an exact circle: its screen radius depends on the acceleration and observer location but not on the conicity, so the local shadow cannot bound the string tension. We provide compact expressions for the photon ring orbital frequency and Lyapunov exponent and use them to obtain eikonal quasinormal estimates; we also show how a single shadow measurement at known position uniquely infers the dimensionless acceleration. As diagnostics of the background, we compute the (generally unequal) surface gravities of the black hole and acceleration horizons and derive an exact redshift law between static worldlines.",
New submissions,"The mechanism for creating""dynamical gravastar'' black hole mimickers can also explain formation of ""little red dots''",Stephen L. Adler,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We argue that a high pressure phase transition of relativistic matter to a state with negative energy density, which leads to the formation of horizonless black hole mimickers, can also give rise to the appearance of ``little red dots''. The energy source for the dots is the release of latent energy from the phase transition, and their redness is a result of this release taking place in a central region of exponentially small positive $g_{00}$, and hence very high gravitational redshift.",
New submissions,Geodesic deviation to all orders via a tangent bundle formalism,Joon-Hwi Kim,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We establish an in-in formalism for geodesic deviation as an alternative to Synge calculus, based on a covariant calculus of differential forms in tangent bundle. This derives the exact Lagrangian and equations governing the finite geodesic deviation between a free-falling test particle and an arbitrary observer, in terms of infinite sums whose coefficients are products of binomial coefficients. Explicit expressions are provided up to tenth order, finding agreements with the previous fourth-order result.",
New submissions,Quasinormal modes of an electrically charged Kalb-Ramond black hole,"Yun-Tao Gu,Wen-Di Guo,Yu-Xiao Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Lorentz violation serves as a significant feature in many modified theories of gravity. In particular, spontaneous Lorentz violation induced by the Kalb-Ramond field has attracted considerable attention. Recently, an electrically charged black hole solution within the Kalb-Ramond framework was proposed. In this study, we investigate the quasinormal modes of the resulting ``undecouplable'' system using both the matrix-valued continued fraction method and the matrix-valued direct integration method. Additionally, we develop a new approach to distinguish between different modes in such ``undecouplable'' systems. An error analysis is performed, and the influence of Lorentz violation on the fundamental quasinormal modes is systematically analyzed within a suitable parameter range.",
New submissions,"Thermoelectric conduction in General Relativity: a causal, stable, and well-posed theory",Lorenzo Gavassino,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"We present a covariantly stable first-order framework for describing charge and heat transport in isotropic rigid solids embedded in curved spacetime. Working in the Lorenz gauge, we show that the associated initial value problem is both causal and locally well-posed in the fully nonlinear regime. We then apply such framework to explore a range of gravitothermoelectric effects in metals undergoing relativistic acceleration. These include (1) the separation of charge through acceleration, (2) the non-uniformity of Joule heating across accelerating circuits due to time dilation, and (3) the effect of redshift on magnetic diffusion. As an astrophysical application, we derive a relativistic Thomas-Fermi equation governing the charge distribution inside a compact object, also accounting for Seebeck charge displacements driven by cooling.",
New submissions,Quasibound States and Superradiant Instability of Black Hole in Analog Gravity,"Hang Liu,Hong Guo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we adopt continued fraction method (CFM) associated with VBK approach, which is recently developed by Vieira, Bezerra and Kokkotas, to investigate the spectrum of quasibound states (QBS) and superradiant instability of massive scalar perturbation imposed on analog rotating black hole in photon-fluid model. We analyze the effects of black hole angular velocity $\Omega_H$ and scalar field mass $\mu$ on QBS spectrum with positive and negative winding number $m=\pm1$, respectively. In addition to the fundamental frequency, we also investigate the overtones in order to disclose more distinctions of spectrum between the states of $m=\pm 1$. We show that the sign of winding number can produce notable impacts on the spectrum, particularly to the imaginary part of the spectrum. We study the superradiant instability and find that the maximum instability for a given $\Omega_H$ is not in monotonic relationship with angular velocity, which is in contrast to the case in Kerr black hole spacetime. As expected, the strength of superradiant instability can be significantly weakened by increasing the winding number. These findings imply that there exists a critical angular velocity under which the instability is strongest in parameter space, and we are supposed to find it out at $m=1$. Indeed, this max instability is found to be $\omega_{Imax}\approx 1.13374\times 10^{-5}$ related to the critical angular velocity $\Omega_H\approx1.22$.",
New submissions,Inflation from entropy,"Udaykrishna Thattarampilly,Yunlong Zheng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate cosmological solutions for the modified gravity theory obtained from quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the geometry and matter fields. The vacuum equations admit inflationary solutions, hinting at an entropic origin for inflation. Equations also admit a regime of phantom like behavior. Assuming that the relation between slow roll parameters and CMB observables holds for entropic gravity, the theory predicts a viable spectrum.",
New submissions,Interaction of exact gravitational waves with matter,"Morteza Mohseni,Saurya Das",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider interactions of exact (i.e., solutions of full nonlinear field equations) gravitational waves with matter by using the Einstein-Boltzmann equation. For a gravitational wave interacting with a system of massless particles, we compute the perturbed energy-momentum tensor and obtain explicit form of a set of Einstein-Boltzmann equations. We find solution to this system of equations to obtain the gravitational wave profile. The interaction superposes a static term on the gravitational wave profile which depends on the difference between square of the temperatures of the system in the absence and in the presence of the wave. We compute this perturbed term when the states of the system obey Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac, and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, respectively. The relative strength of this term is roughly half for the Fermi-Dirac, and one-third for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions compared with that of the Bose-Einstein distribution. We consider both Minkowski and flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker backgrounds.",
New submissions,Regular Bardeen black holes within non-minimal scalar-linear electrodynamic couplings,"Daniela S. J. Cordeiro,Ednaldo L. B. Junior,José Tarciso S. S. Junior,Francisco S. N. Lobo,Jorde A. A. Ramos,Manuel E. Rodrigues,Diego Rubiera-Garcia,Luís F. Dias da Silva,Henrique A. Vieira",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we demonstrate that a linear electromagnetic matter source can be constructed for regular black hole solutions, illustrated by the case of the Bardeen black hole. Our method relies on coupling a scalar field and its potential to General Relativity (GR) alongside electrodynamics. Both fields are minimally coupled to GR but interact with each other. We validate this approach by interpreting the Bardeen solution either as a purely magnetic or as a purely electric configuration for a spherically symmetric metric with an arbitrary electrodynamics Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(F)$ and a coupling function $W(\varphi)$. By choosing an appropriate form of $W$, the electromagnetic Lagrangian can be rendered linear. We then analyze the behavior of the coupling function and the scalar field potential, emphasizing their relation to the magnetic or electric charge. Finally, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of this framework with the conventional formalism, in which regular charged black holes are supported solely by nonlinear electrodynamics.",
New submissions,Black bounce solutions via nonminimal scalar-electrodynamic couplings,"Daniela S. J. Cordeiro,Ednaldo L. B. Junior,José Tarciso S. S. Junior,Francisco S. N. Lobo,Jorde A. A. Ramos,Manuel E. Rodrigues,Luís F. Dias da Silva,Henrique A. Vieira",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Black-bounce (BB) solutions generalize the spacetimes of black holes, regular black holes, and wormholes, depending on the values of certain characteristic parameters. In this work, we investigate such solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), assuming spherical symmetry and static geometry. It is well established in the literature that, in order to sustain such geometries, the source of Einstein's equations in the BB context can be composed of a scalar field $\varphi$ and a nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). In our model, in addition to the Lagrangian associated with the scalar field in the action, we also include an interaction term of the form $W(\varphi)\mathcal{L}(F)$, which introduces a nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and the electromagnetic sector. Notably, the usual minimal coupling configuration is recovered by setting $W(\varphi)=1$. In contrast to approaches where the function $W(\varphi)$ is assumed a priori, here we determine its functional form by modeling the radial dependence of the derivative of the electromagnetic Lagrangian as a power law, namely $\mathcal{L}_F(r) \sim F^n$. This approach enables us to determine $W(r)$ directly from the obtained solutions. We apply this procedure to two specific geometries: the Simpson-Visser-type BB solution and the Bardeen-type BB solution, both analyzed in the purely magnetic ($q_m \neq 0$, $q_e=0$) and purely electric ($q_m=0$, $q_e \neq 0$) cases. In all scenarios, we find that these BB spacetime solutions can be described with a linear electrodynamics, which is a noteworthy result. Furthermore, we examine the regularity of the spacetime through the Kretschmann scalar and briefly discuss the associated energy conditions for the solutions obtained.",
New submissions,Scalarizations of qOS-extremal black hole and Aretakis instability,Yun Soo Myung,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study scalarization of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS)-extremal black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory.This black hole is described by mass ($M=4\sqrt{\alpha}/3\sqrt{3}$) with $\alpha$ quantum parameter. From studying onset of scalarization, we find the appearance of the single branch of scalarized qOS-extremal black holes. To obtain the tachyonic scalar cloud being a seed to generate the single branch of scalarized qOS-extremal black holes, we consider the near-horizon geometry of the Bertotti-Bobinson (BR) spacetime. In this case, we find that the appearance of a large scalar cloud at the horizon ($\rho=0$) is a new feature to represent onset scalarization of extremal black holes for tachyon with negative mass, but it is not related to the Aretakis instability of a propagating scalar with standard mass around the BR spacetime, showing polynomial instability of the ingoing time $v$. The Aretakis instability is connected to the scalar cloud with standard mass, indicating the blow-up at the horizon.",
New submissions,Telling apart black holes and naked singularities with trajectories of massive particles,"Angelos Karakonstantakis,Włodek Kluźniak,Maciek Wielgus",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We performed a numerical study of the dynamics of massive particles orbiting black holes and naked singularities in the Reissner-Nordström geometry. We modeled a stream of particles with a constant angular momentum and with a range of energies. We then solved the geodesic equation of motion and compared the trajectories around black holes and naked singularities by tuning the charge parameter of the metric. The setup that we used can approximate astrophysical scenarios such as tidal disruption events. We discussed differences and similarities in the orbital dynamics and deflection angles. We found that particles reflected by a black hole follow a stream-like family of orbits within a narrow range of deflection angles, whereas in case of naked singularities particles are scattered in all directions on the plain of motion. We explained this behavior as an interplay between the presence of a centrifugal barrier at the location of the unstable circular orbit and an absorbing event horizon in case of a black hole or a reflective zero-gravity sphere in case of a naked singularity. These qualitative differences are expected to impact the observable signatures of tidal disruption events.",
New submissions,de Sitter Corrections to Gravitational Wave Memory,"Anthi Voulgari Revof,Shubhanshu Tiwari",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we compute the gravitational wave displacement and spin memory effects in de Sitter spacetime. Gravitational waves in asymptotically flat spacetimes are described by the Bondi-Sachs framework, where radiation at null infinity is tied to the BMS group, and memory appears as permanent changes in the geometry. This formalism becomes more complicated when asymptotic flatness is not guaranteed. With a positive cosmological constant, future infinity is spacelike rather than null, and the decay of the fields differs qualitatively from the flat case. The Bondi-Sachs methods adapted to a positive cosmological constant show that the asymptotic symmetry algebra reduces to time translations and rotations, and that the balance equations for charges and fluxes take a modified form. Our calculation at leading order yields flux-balance relations for displacement and spin memory directly in terms of the cosmological constant Lambda and Bondi-Sachs data. We also find that the cosmological constant mixes spherical-harmonic modes of the memory potentials, producing a (3,0) component in displacement memory and a (2,0) component in spin memory.",
New submissions,Non-perturbative results for a massive scalar field during de Sitter inflation,G. Karakaya,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider an infrared truncated massive minimally coupled scalar field with an asymmetric self-interaction $\frac{m^2}{2}\varphi^2\!+\!\frac{\lambda\varphi^4}{4!}\!+\!\frac{\beta\varphi^3}{3!}(\lambda\!>\!0)$ during a cosmological constant driven de Sitter inflation with a constant expansion rate, $H$. The Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of the massive scalar field is obtained and solved for this asymmetric potential. Firstly we compute the vacuum expectation values of $\varphi$ and $\varphi^2$ using the normalized late-time probability distribution $\rho(\varphi,t)$. Secondly, we evaluate the two-point correlation function and the vacuum expectation value of the massive scalar field at tree and one-loop order following Starobinsky's approach and applying the techniques of perturbative quantum field theory. Lastly, we compare the results obtained via these two different methods. Although these results give consistent qualitative behavior at tree and one-loop order, they differ numerically.",
New submissions,The causal structure of the c-completion of warped spacetimes,"Luis Aké Hau,Saul Burgos,Didier A. Solis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Metric Geometry (math.MG),"In this work we study the structure of the future causal completion $\hat{M}$ of a globally hyperbolic GRW spacetime $\mathbb{R}\times_\alpha M$ using the novel notion of Lorentzian pre-length spaces.

New submissions,Accounting for Tidal Deformability in Binary Neutron Star Template Banks,"Lorenzo Piccari,Francesco Pannarale",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Modelled searches for gravitational waves emitted by compact binary coalescences currently filter the data with template signals that ignore all effects related to the physics of dense-matter in neutron stars interiors, even when the masses in the template are compatible with a binary neutron star or a neutron star-black hole binary source. The leading neutron star finite-size effect is an additional phase contribution due to tidal deformations induced by the gravitational coupling between the two inspiralling objects in the binary. We show how neglecting this effect in the templates reduces the search sensitivity close to the detection threshold. This is particularly true for binary neutron stars systems, where tidal effects are larger. In this work we therefore propose a new technique for the construction of binary neutron star template banks that accounts for neutron star tidal deformabilities as degrees of freedom of the parameter space to be searched over. A first attempt in this direction was carried out by Harry & Lundgren [Physical Review D 104, 043008 (2021)], who proposed to extract randomly the tidal deformabilities of the stars over a uniform interval, regardless of the binary neutron star component masses. We show that this approach yields 33% additional templates with respect to the equivalent point-like template bank. Our proposed approach, instead, adopts a more physically motivated tidal deformability prior with a support that is informed by the value of the neutron star mass and compatible with the neutron star equation of state constraint provided by the observation of GW170817. This method significantly reduces the needed additional templates to 8.2%.",
New submissions,"Cosmological Scenarios in $f(Q,C)$ gravity with a dynamical degree of freedom","Hamid Shabani,Avik De",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The $f(Q,C)$ theory, which extends symmetric teleparallel gravity by including the boundary term $C$ in addition to the non-metricity scalar $Q$, provides a unifying framework that encompasses both $f(Q)$ and $f(\mathring{R})$ gravities. In this work, we develop a comprehensive dynamical system analysis of $f(Q,C)$ cosmology formulated within the non-coincident affine connection branches. Unlike the coincident case, these branches introduce a dynamical degree of freedom that significantly enriches the cosmological phase space. We show that even for simple power-law forms of the Lagrangian, the theory accommodates a broad spectrum of cosmic scenarios, including successive pressureless matter eras, stiff-matter phases between early inflation and dark matter domination, and late-time acceleration. Our analysis demonstrates that the Universe can naturally evolve from an initial de Sitter phase to a matter-dominated epoch and subsequently to a final de Sitter attractor, consistent with the observed thermal history.

New submissions,A Five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein Approach to Unimodular Gravity,"Júlio C. Fabris,Richard Kerner",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this article we present a possibility of imposing the unimodular condition within the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field. Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late 80-ties; and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. A generalization of the unimodularity principle to the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein model was discussed in our recent paper, in which variational principle is formulated in 5 dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations was then presented and discussed. Here we present further developments of this approach, focussing our attention at perturbative aspects and stability of solutions.",
New submissions,Polymer Bianchi-I with polymer matter,"Aleena Zulfiqar,Syed Moeez Hassan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze the effective dynamics of a polymer quantized homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi-I universe coupled to a polymer quantized scalar field. We use a pressureless dust field as an internal clock, and work with the gravitational Misner variables. We find that for a consistent polymer quantization of the anisotropies, the volume variable has to be polymerized first, and that a choice of different polymer scales for the two leads to substantially different dynamics. We derive an effective Friedmann equation for this model, and also compute the shear scalar. We show that polymer quantizing the scalar field leads to significant differences in the evolution of various cosmological quantities as compared to standard quantization. Furthermore, there is asymmetric evolution across the bounce for both the volume variable and the anisotropies. The amount of these variations and asymmetry, as well as the location of the quantum bounce, depends on the matter polymer scale.",
New submissions,Prospect on constraining string-theory-inspired model from gravitational redshift measurements,"Li Hu,Rong-Gen Cai,Song He,Li-Fang Li,Tong Liu,Peng Xu,Shao-Jiang Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Scalar-tensor gravity represents a natural extension of general relativity. Testing such models experimentally provides a crucial pathway to probing physics at high-energy scales, particularly in the context of string theory. This paper investigates a string-theory-inspired scalar-tensor gravity -- the dilaton model -- and identifies regions of its parameter space potentially constrained by gravitational redshift experiments in future. By further modeling the mass distribution in low-density environments with a discrete representation, we go beyond the standard continuous approximation. Despite limitations inherent to specific experimental configurations, our analysis reveals that a significant portion of the parameter space remains accessible. Consequently, high-precision gravitational redshift experiments hold the potential to exclude significant regions of this parameter space in future.",
New submissions,Gravitational quasinormal modes of Dymnikova black holes,"Bekir Can Lütfüoğlu,Erdinç Ulaş Saka,Abubakir Shermatov,Inomjon Ibragimov,Javlon Rayimbaev,Sokhibjan Muminov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate gravitational quasinormal modes of the Dymnikova black hole, a regular spacetime in which the central singularity is replaced by a de Sitter core. This geometry, originally proposed as a phenomenological model, also arises naturally in the framework of Asymptotically Safe gravity, where quantum corrections lead to a scale-dependent modification of the Schwarzschild solution. Focusing on axial gravitational perturbations, we compute the dominant quasinormal frequencies using the WKB method with Padé approximants and verify the results with time-domain integration. We find that the introduction of the quantum parameter $l_{\rm cr}$ leads to systematic deviations from the Schwarzschild spectrum: the real oscillation frequency decreases as $l_{\rm cr}$ increases, while the damping rate also becomes smaller, implying longer-lived modes. In the limit of large $l_{\rm cr}$, the quasinormal spectrum smoothly approaches the Schwarzschild case. These results suggest that even though the corrections are localized near the horizon, they leave imprints in the gravitational-wave ringdown which may become accessible to observation with future high-precision detectors.",
New submissions,The generalized second law for fermionic and bosonic fields,Koray Düztaş,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We evaluate the validity of the generalied second law for Kerr black holes perturbed by fermionic and bosonic fields. We derive that the critical frequency for a test field below which the area of a Kerr black hole would decrease, coincides with the superradiance limit which pertains to bosonic fields. The fact that the absorption of fermionic fields with arbitrarily low frequencies is allowed, leads to a generic violation of the generalized second law as both the black hole and the environment lose entropy. The result does not contradict the proof of the area theorem which pre-assumes the validity of the null energy condition. We also construct a thought experiment involving bosonic fields to check whether the minimum increase in the area can compensate for the decrease in the entropy of the environment. We minimize the entropy increase by considering a black hole at the extremal limit, perturbed by a bosonic field at the superradiance limit. We show that the generalized second law remains valid for bosonic fields that satisfy the null energy condition. The result does not require the employment of entropy bounds when one assigns von Neumann entropy to test fields.",

New submissions,"Comment on ""Strong lensing and shadow of Ayon-Beato-Garcia (ABG) nonsingular black hole""",M. Fahmi Fauzi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It was suggested by Ramadhan et al. (Eur Phys J C 83:465, 2023) that the Sagittarius A* black hole cannot be modeled by an Ayón-Beato-Garcìa regular black hole due to the incompatible shadow radius. However, they overlooked the distant-observer limit of the correction term in the effective geometry, which renders their calculation invalid. When evaluated correctly, the result reverses the conclusion of the paper. This comment highlights the flaw and demonstrates how to properly compute the shadow radius of such a black hole model using elementary geometry.",
New submissions,Black Hole Solution in Anti-de Sitter Space with a New Cloud of Strings Surrounded by Dark Matter Halo,"Faizuddin Ahmed,Edilberto O. Silva",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical study of a Schwarzschild-like Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) influenced by a new cloud of strings (NCS) and a dark matter halo (DMH) characterized by a Dehnen-type density profile. We analyze the geodesic motion of both massless and massive test particles, highlighting how the NCS and DMH parameters affect the effective potentials, photon spheres, circular orbits, BH shadow, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of test particles. Additionally, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of the BH in an extended phase space by deriving key quantities, such as the Hawking temperature, the equation of state (EoS), Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and the specific heat capacity. Our results show that the presence of NCS and DMH induces significant modifications in both the dynamical and thermodynamical behavior of the BH, including shifts in the Hawking-Page transition and divergences in heat capacity, thereby reshaping the phase structure of the BH.",
New submissions,Constraints on quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes with eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals,"Sen Yang,Yu-Peng Zhang,Li Zhao,Yu-Xiao Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the potential of extreme mass-ratio inspirals to constrain quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes within the framework of loop quantum gravity. We consider a stellar-mass object orbiting a supermassive Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole in an equatorial eccentric trajectory. To explore the dynamical behavior of the system, we analyze its orbital evolution under gravitational radiation within the adiabatic approximation and the mass-quadrupole formula for different initial orbital configurations. Our results show that the quantum correction parameter $\hat{\alpha}$ slows down the evolution of the orbital semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then employ the numerical kludge method to generate the corresponding time-domain gravitational waveforms. To assess detectability, we include Doppler modulation due to the motion of space-based detectors and compute the frequency-domain characteristic strain. By evaluating mismatches between response signals for different values of $\hat{\alpha}$, we show that even small corrections $(\hat{\alpha} \sim 10^{-5})$ produce distinguishable effects. Our analysis suggests that future space-based detectors such as LISA can probe quantum gravitational corrections in the strong-field regime and place constraints significantly stronger than those from black hole shadow observations.",
New submissions,Consistent energy-momentum trace couplings of fluids,"Christian G. Boehmer,Eissa Al-Nasrallah",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Gravitational models with non-minimal couplings involving the trace of the energy-momentum tensor have become increasingly popular. The idea of coupling the trace of the matter tensor to the geometry can be applied to various matter models, including relativistic perfect fluids. However, it is well-known that the variational formulation of perfect fluids involves some technicalities. We carefully derive the field equations including the trace coupling of a perfect fluid using two different approaches, namely, that given by Brown using Lagrange multipliers, and that given by Schutz using velocity potentials. We show that previous results involving such trace couplings do not match the results presented here. We demonstrate that our fluid's equations of motion are consistent with the gravitational field equations. Moreover, we present a simple on-shell argument which further supports the correctness of our results.Our work implies that a vast amount of the $f(R,T)$ literature using perfect fluids needs to be revisited.",

Pizaña,Juan Carlos Hidalgo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We examine gravitational entropy growth within the formalism of Clifton, Ellis and Tavakol (CET) applied to a class of spherically symmetric exact solutions whose source is a shear-free fluid with energy flux in a comoving frame. By considering these solutions as potential cosmological models, we update previous literature that considered them only as restricted toy models of radiating spheres collapsing in a Vaidya background. In the present paper we examine the integrability of the CET entropy form in connection with Einstein's equations in the fluid flow approach, proving as well that all expanding configurations comply with the growth of CET gravitational entropy. Finally, we examine the connection between the CET gravitational entropy and the notion of a gravitational ``arrow of time'' based on the ratio of Weyl to Ricci curvature. Some of the solutions also provide potentially useful and viable inhomogeneous generalizations of FLRW models, thus suggesting an appealing potential for applications to current cosmological research.",
New submissions,Effective Free Energy Landscapes and Hawking-Page Transitions,Choon-Lin Ho,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"A recent interesting development on the dynamics of black hole phase transitions, the Hawking-Page transition, has been the so-called Gibbs free energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can be used to study the modification of the Hawking-Page transition of a black hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes under a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise disfavors the formation of black hole.",
New submissions,Monte Carlo quantum cosmology with a modified Euclidean action,"Malaik Kabir,Syed Moeez Hassan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We numerically study the Euclidean quantum cosmology of a closed, homogeneous and isotropic universe with a cosmological constant. A dust field acts as a clock, and we compute the ground state wavefunction, correlation function, and mean volume of the universe by performing path integral Monte Carlo simulations. To make the path integral convergent, the argument of the exponent in the weight of the path integral is chosen to be either the absolute value of the Euclidean action, or its square. We compare our results to the standard case (with a hard cutoff at zero action), and find that the absolute value produces similar results, whereas the squared method gives substantially different results. We detail two different methods of `fixing' the squared case, and test them for the simple harmonic oscillator, and for this cosmological model. We also find that for a large positive cosmological constant, the universe undergoes multiple cycles of expansion and contraction for all three weights, and reaches much larger sizes with the squared weight.",
New submissions,Quasinormal spectra of higher dimensional regular black holes in theories with infinite curvature corrections,Juan Pablo Arbelaez,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),We investigate the quasinormal modes of several families of higher-dimensional regular black holes arising in gravitational theories that incorporate an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections to Einstein gravity. Our analysis focuses on how the ringdown phase of gravitational waves for such regular black holes deviates from the predictions of General Relativity. We employ the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method to calculate the quasinormal modes and to derive compact analytic expressions in the eikonal approximation. Our results contribute to understanding how possible quantum-gravity-motivated corrections and regularity conditions can manifest in gravitational-wave signals.,

Pachos",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We investigate the apparent thermality of Hawking radiation in the semi-classical limit of quantum black holes using the mean-field limit of a chiral spin-chain simulator, which models fermions propagating on a black hole space-time in the continuum. In this free-theory regime, no genuine thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole interior.",
Cross submissions,Making the Case for Massive Islands,Hao Geng,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"It has been established in both high and low spacetime dimensions that existing constructions of entanglement islands, at least in the study of black holes, are all in the context of massive gravity. In fact, later studies realized that the graviton mass is not an accident and it is necessary for the consistency of the holographic interpretation for entanglement islands. An important lesson we learned from these studies is that the graviton mass is a manifestation of the deep relationship between quantum entanglement and emergent geometry (EPR=ER). Nevertheless, various interesting questions and counter-arguments exist regarding whether this connection is of any relevance, either by modifying the definition of entanglement islands or denying the graviton mass as a physically relevant concept. In this paper, we will revisit the necessity of graviton mass for the consistency of entanglement islands and address the above questions in and out of the literature. Since the calculations in higher dimensions are already well understood, we will start with a demonstration of massive islands in a frequently used lower dimensional model, AdS$_{2}$ Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled with transparent conformal matter fields, for which the relationship between energy dissipation and the graviton mass manifests. We will then discuss the necessity of graviton mass for entanglement islands in general situations and clarify the physical meaning of graviton mass. In the end, we will comment on the attempts to construct entanglement islands in massless gravity and suggest the search for a new type of entanglement wedges in holography.The purpose of this paper is to summarize the recent progress, clarifying potential confusions and convey key messages to both experts and non-experts in the field.",
Cross submissions,Gauging the Standard Model 1-form symmetry via gravitational instantons,Mohamed M. Anber,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate the fate of the Standard Model (SM) $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ electric $1$-form global symmetry in the background of gravitational instantons, focusing on Eguchi-Hanson (EH) geometries. We show that EH instantons support quantized $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ fluxes localized on their $S^2$ bolt, inducing fractional topological charge without backreacting on the geometry. The requirement that quark and lepton wavefunctions be globally well-defined under parallel transport imposes boundary conditions, removing ill-defined fermion zero modes; the surviving spectrum is confirmed by an explicit solution of the Dirac equation and by the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. The Euclidean path integral in the EH background can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an entangled state between two identical halves of space to the vacuum. Summing over all $\mathbb{Z}_6^{(1)}$ flux sectors in the path integral gauges the SM $1$-form symmetry; thus, it cannot persist as an exact global symmetry in the semiclassical limit of gravity. We further show that these fluxes induce baryon- and lepton-number violating processes, which are exponentially suppressed due to the smallness of the hypercharge coupling constant.",
Cross submissions,A proof of Generalized Connected Wedge Theorem,Bowen Zhao,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the context of asymptotic $2$-to-$2$ scattering process in AdS/CFT, the Connected Wedge Theorem identifies the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information between suitable boundary subregions, referred to as decision regions, as a necessary but not sufficient condition for bulk-only scattering processes, i.e., nonempty bulk scattering region $S_0$. Recently, Liu and Leutheusser proposed an enlarged bulk scattering region $S_E$ and conjectured that the non-emptiness of $S_E$ fully characterizes the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information between decision regions. Here, we provide a geometrical or general relativity proof for a slightly modified version of their conjecture.",

Colin Hill",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Inflation generates correlated temperature ($T$) and polarization ($E$-mode) fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which differ only by their transfer functions. Following Philcox et al. (2025), we investigate a scenario with a massive partner to the inflaton ($\mathcal{O}(100)$ times the inflationary Hubble scale), in which particles are produced during a narrow time period, leaving characteristic hot- or cold-spots in the CMB. Using tools developed for thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster-finding, we search component-separated $\textit{Planck}$ PR4 $E$-mode maps for these hotspots, and compare to analogous results in $T$. Our analysis pipeline is validated on simulated observations and gives unbiased constraints for sufficiently large and bright hotspots. We find no strong evidence for primordial hotspots and thereby place novel bounds on the marginal and relevant coupling between the inflaton and massive scalars during inflation, probing physics at energies many orders of magnitude above any feasible terrestrial collider. Due to the large noise in $\textit{Planck}$ polarization, the temperature data dominate constraints for small hotspots, but for sufficiently large hotspots, our bounds improve on those of Philcox et al. (2025) by $\sim 25\%$. We also forecast the inferred bounds on inflationary physics for a search using Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data, and from an optimistic cosmic-variance-limited experiment (CV), for which $E$-mode data provide stronger constraints than $T$ on nearly all scales. ACT should improve on the $\textit{Planck}$ constraints by $\gtrsim25\%$, nearing the CV limit on intermediate scales. Finally, we compare the constraining power of localized searches to that of a power spectrum analysis, and demonstrate that for sufficiently few produced particles the localized search performed herein is dominant.",
Cross submissions,Evidence for increasing dark energy in DESI from the Local Distance Ladder,"Maryam Aghaei Abchouyeh,Maurice H.P.M. van Putten",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The {\it Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument} (DESI) provides a comprehensive survey of {\it Baryon Acoustic Oscillation} (BAO) in the {\it Large Scale Structure} (LSS), {in stratified data covering a finite redshift range.} Extracting cosmological parameters in a joint analysis of LSS-CMB data is hereby inherently a nonlinear problem. In particular, this nonlinearity may concern the unknown equation of state of dark energy $w(a)$, defined in the general $w(a)$CDM framework. Nevertheless, a common approach is the linearized approximation hereto notably $w_0w_a$CDM, also applied by DESI. Here, we consider a potential source of a systematic uncertainty in this linearization due to non-commutativity between $w_0w_a$CDM and {\it a posteriori} linearization of $w(a)$CDM, identified with a symmetry in the latter, which is violated in the former. We shall refer to these as early and late linearization, respectively. We demonstrate this in the analysis of the Hubble expansion in the Local Distance Ladder (LDL). Strikingly, opposite results are found for the evolution of dark energy by early versus late linearization, indicating a thawing or respectively, increasing dark energy. It is unlikely that the DESI pipeline is immune to the same contradiction. Our results show rather than thawing, claimed by DESI, dark energy may in fact be increasing. Further confirmation is expected from {\it Euclid}.",

CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \simeq 1 \times 10^{-18}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.",

Corrected black hole solutions with this quantum fuzziness are obtained, and their thermodynamic analysis is performed. We show that the conventional first law of black hole thermodynamics is violated since the entropy deviates from the Bekenstein-Hawking form. Introducing a correction to the mass restores consistency, yielding a modified first law compatible with Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Next, we investigate the effects of spacetime non-commutativity on the thermodynamic universality of these black holes. We demonstrate that non-commutativity modifies the standard universality relations of black holes and can induce thermodynamic stability by altering the underlying microscopic interactions. Our results suggest that quantum features of spacetime can have significant macroscopic consequences for black hole thermodynamics.",
Cross submissions,Scrambling-Enhanced Quantum Battery Charging in Black Hole Analogues,"Zhilong Liu,Ying Li,Zehua Tian,Jieci Wang",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Black holes constitute nature's fastest quantum information scramblers, a phenomenon captured by gravitational analogue systems such as position-dependent XY spin chains. In these models, scrambling dynamics are governed exclusively by the hopping interactions profile, independent of system size. Utilizing such curved spacetime analogues as quantum batteries, we explore how the black hole scrambling affects charging via controlled quenches of preset scrambling parameters. Our analysis reveals that the intentionally engineered difference between post-quench and pre-quench scrambling parameters could significantly enhance both maximum stored energy $E_{\max}$ and peak charging power $P_{\max}$ in the quench charging protocol. The optimal charging time $\tau_*$ exhibits negligible dependence on the preset initial horizon parameter $x_{h0}$, while decreasing monotonically with increasing quench horizon parameter $x_{ht}$. This temporal compression confines high-power operation to regimes with strong post-quench scrambling $x_{ht} > x_{h0}$, demonstrating accelerated charging mediated by spacetime-mimicking scrambling dynamics.",

We fix Weyl symmetry, or equivalently local scale symmetry by a gauge condition $R = 0$ à la BRST formalism, and see that the condensation of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts, $\langle \bar c c \rangle \neq 0$ leads to a generation of the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity. This dynamical mechanism of symmetry breakdown for a global scale symmetry is new in the sense that the reduction of fermionic degrees of freedom effectively leads to a generation of bosonic degrees of freedom. We also discuss this mechanism from the viewpoint of the problem of a bound state, and show that asymptotic fields corresponding to the bound states are ``confined'' to the unphysical Hilbert space.",
Cross submissions,Aligned Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in AGN disks revealed by GWTC-4,"Yin-Jie Li,Yuan-Zhu Wang,Shao-Peng Tang,Yi-Zhong Fan",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disks are ideal sites for hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers. To robustly probe such a possibility, we analyze binary black hole mergers in the GWTC-4 with a flexible mixture population model for component masses, spin magnitudes, and spin tilt angles, and identify two distinct subpopulations. In the second subpopulation characterized by high spin magnitudes $\chi\sim 0.8$ as well as the broad mass distribution up to $\gtrsim 150M_\odot$, we find a pronounced preference for spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum: an isotropic tilt distribution is strongly disfavored (logarithmic Bayes factor = 4.5). The aligned events account for $\sim 0.57^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$ of the second subpopulation, corresponding to a local rate of $\sim 0.25^{+0.38}_{-0.16} ~ {\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ (all values reflect central 90\% credible intervals). These notable features naturally arise from hierarchical mergers embedded in AGN disks, where gas torques can effectively align spins. Our results identify AGN-disk hierarchical assembly as an important channel in the present gravitational-wave sample and provide concrete, testable predictions for future detection.",

Shapiro",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore the renormalization group-based extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model as a potential solution to the current cosmological tensions. In this approach, both the cosmological constant density and Newton's constant are allowed to vary with the energy scale, as a consequence of the remnant effects of massive quantum fields in the low-energy regime. The corresponding cosmological model is consistent with the principles of quantum field theory, based on the covariance of the vacuum effective action, and is characterized by an unique extra parameter $\nu$. Our analysis yields a best-fit value of $\nu = - (2.5 \pm 1.3)\times 10^{-4}$, placing the $\Lambda$CDM limit at the $2\sigma$ region of the $\nu$ posterior. This narrow range is consistent with data from CMB (Planck), BAO (DESI), and SN Ia (DES Y5). Our result also alleviates the $H_0$ tension and is consistent with the previously established constraints from large-scale structure. In this kind of models there is a link between cosmology and particle physics. Our results point to possibility of a new physics, characterized by a mass spectrum lying below the Planck scale but above the values typically associated with Grand Unified Theories (GUTs).",
Cross submissions,Residual Symmetries and Algebraic Structures in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy I,Brandon Holton,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"The Kerr-Schild double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content has been less explored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the Kerr-Schild double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the Kerr-Schild potential, finding they form an infinite-dimensional parameterized by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting residual diffeomorphisms of the Kerr-Schild Schwarzschild metric. Restricting our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of Schwarzschild, reducing the residual algebra to a subalgebra of Poincaré. This finding confirms a fundamental structural mismatch: the infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no analogous structure in this gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition, establishing the consistency of this algebraic reduction within a quantum field theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In Part II, we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal Killing vector class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework.",

Our machine learning framework generates uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al. 2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and mutual consistency among the standard $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\Lambda_s$CDM models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of minimizing an appropriate $\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to be largely contained within the $2\sigma$ contours of their counterparts trained on BAO data. Their posterior medians for $h_0$ were within about $2\sigma$ of one another, indicating that our machine learning-guided approach provides a different measure of the Hubble tension.",
Cross submissions,"SymBoltz.jl: a symbolic-numeric, approximation-free and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver",Herman Sletmoen,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph),"SymBoltz is a new Julia package that solves the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well in model space. The modeler should simply write down their equations, and SymBoltz solves them and eliminates much of the friction in the process. SymBoltz enables up to 100x shorter model definitions compared to browsing equivalent files in CLASS. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages like the background and perturbations, generating the Jacobian matrix and its sparsity pattern, and interpolating arbitrary expressions from the solution. Modern implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times, reducing slowdowns by taking long time steps, reusing the Jacobian and LU-factorizing it over several time steps, and using fast linear system solvers. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in large parameter spaces, training of emulators, Fisher forecasting and sensitivity analysis. These features are useful in their own rights, but also reinforce each other in a synergy. Results agree with established codes like CLASS and CAMB. With more work, SymBoltz can grow into an integrated symbolic-numeric cosmological modeling environment with a large library of models that delivers differentiable output as fast as other codes. SymBoltz is available atthis https URLwith single-command installation and extensive documentation, and welcomes questions, suggestions and contributions.",
Cross submissions,Dynamical Covariant Quantum Spacetime with Fuzzy Extra Dimensions in the IKKT model,"Alessandro Manta,Harold C. Steinacker",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider general $k=-1$ FLRW covariant quantum spacetimes $\mathcal{M}^{3,1} \times \mathcal{K}$ with fuzzy extra dimensions $\mathcal{K}$ as classical solutions of the IKKT matrix model. The coupled equations of motion are recast in terms of conservation laws, which allow to determine the evolution of spacetime in a transparent way. We show that $\mathcal{K}$ is stabilized as a classical solution in the presence of a large $R$ charge, corresponding to internal angular momentum. This provides a mechanism to maintain a large hierarchy between UV and IR scales. We also argue that the evolution of spacetime is determined by a balance between classical and quantum effects, leading to a cosmic scale factor $a(t) \sim t$ and constant dilaton at late times. On such a background, the undeformed IKKT model leads to a higher-spin gauge theory including gravity.",
Cross submissions,Parallel Nested Slice Sampling for Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation,"David Yallup,Metha Prathaban,James Alvey,Will Handley",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Inferring parameters and testing hypotheses from gravitational wave signals is a computationally intensive task central to modern astrophysics. Nested sampling, a Bayesian inference technique, has become an established standard for this in the field. However, most common implementations lack the ability to fully utilize modern hardware acceleration. In this work, we demonstrate that when nested sampling is reformulated in a natively vectorized form and run on modern GPU hardware, we can perform inference in a fraction of the time of legacy nested sampling implementations whilst preserving the accuracy and robustness of the method. This scalable, GPU-accelerated approach significantly advances nested sampling for future large-scale gravitational-wave analyses.",
Cross submissions,The failure of the Ehlers--Kundt conjecture in the impulsive case,"Moriz L. Frauenberger,James D.E. Grant,Roland Steinbauer",Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In 1962, Ehlers and Kundt conjectured that plane waves are the only class of complete Ricci-flat~\emph{pp}-waves, i.e.\ metrics on ${\mathbb R}^4$ of the form \[ ds^2=2du\,dv+dx^2+dy^2+H(x,y,u)du^2\,. \] Recently, Flores and Sánchez gave a proof of the conjecture in the fundamental case of spatially polynomially bounded profile functions $H$. However, impulsive pp-waves, i.e., waves with concentrated profile functions of the form $H(x,y,u)=f(x,y)\,\delta(u)$ ($\delta$, the Dirac measure) have been found to be complete. We summarise completeness results for several classes of impulsive wave spacetimes achieved during the last years and discuss them in the context of the Ehlers--Kundt conjecture.",
Cross submissions,Unified laboratory-frame analysis of atomic gravitational-wave sensors,"Simon Schaffrath,Daniel Störk,Fabio Di Pumpo,Enno Giese",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph),"Atomic sensors using light-matter interactions, in particular atomic clocks and atom interferometers, have the potential to complement optical gravitational-wave detectors in the mid-frequency regime. Although both rely on interference, the interfering components of clocks are spatially colocated, whereas atom interferometers are based on spatial superpositions. Both the electromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions, while propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive particles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective potentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work, we analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom interferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in atom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a gravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed for clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure the spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight that this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including possible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave. While such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial optical clocks normally rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to leading order. Moreover, we show that both sensors can be enhanced by composite interrogation protocols in a common framework. To this end, we propose a pulse sequence that can be used for large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers and for hyper-echo atomic clocks, leading to a signal enhancement and noise suppression.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism II: Fermionic axion inflation,"Richard von Eckardstein,Kai Schmitz,Oleksandr Sobol",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Axion inflation represents an intriguing source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a companion paperarXiv:2508.00798, we previously leveraged the gradient expansion formalism (GEF) to investigate pure axion inflation (PAI), i.e., axion inflaton coupled to a pure gauge sector. In this paper, we extend our analysis to fermionic axion inflation (FAI), i.e., we allow for the presence of fermions in the gauge sector. PAI predicts a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum; in our GEF benchmark study, all parameter regions leading to observable GWs turned out to violate the upper limit on the number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. As we demonstrate in this paper, the situation is different for FAI: Schwinger pair creation of the charged fermions results in a damping of the gauge-field production, which attenuates the GW signal. As a result, the GW signal from FAI can fall into the sensitivity reach of LISA and ET without violating the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. This result notably applies to the arguably most realistic variant of Abelian axion inflation, in which the axion couples to the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model. Besides, we discuss GW emission from the fermion gas, which may further enhance the total GW signal but which also requires a more quantitative investigation in future work. Additionally, we identify a new backreaction regime in which fermion production moderates the axion--vector dynamics. In this regime, the axion velocity and all energy-density components exhibit oscillations analogous to the strong backreaction in PAI, but here, the oscillations occur around the slow-roll trajectory and are damped by the presence of charged fermions. These observations define again an interesting GEF benchmark for future lattice studies.",
Cross submissions,Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs,"Nilanjandev Bhaumik,Huai-Ke Guo,Si-Jiang Liu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.",
Cross submissions,From Dark Radiation to Dark Energy: Unified Cosmological Evolution in K-essence Models,"Eladio Moreno,Josue De-Santiago",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study a class of Unified Dark Matter (UDM) models based on generalized K-essence, where a single scalar field with non-canonical kinetic terms accounts for dark radiation, dark matter, and dark energy. Starting from the purely kinetic Lagrangian proposed by Scherrer (2004), we extend the analysis to quadratic and exponential scalar potentials and explore their phenomenology. All models are implemented in a modified version of \texttt{Hi\_CLASS} and confronted with data from \textit{Planck} 2018, DESI DR1, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The scenarios reproduce the full sequence of cosmic epochs: an early radiation-like phase, a matter-dominated era, and late-time accelerated expansion. The new models predict slightly higher values of the Hubble constant compared to $\Lambda$CDM, thereby partially alleviating the respective tensions from $\sim 4.4 \sigma$ to $\sim 3.4 \sigma$. The quadratic potential requires an ultralight mass that makes it effectively indistinguishable from the Scherrer solution. Overall, generalized K-essence provides a minimal and observationally viable realization of UDM, offering a unified description of the dark sector with distinctive signatures in both early- and late-time cosmology.",
