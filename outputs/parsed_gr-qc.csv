New submissions,Quantum Particle Creation by Cosmic Strings in de Sitter Spacetime,"Bilgehan Baris Oner,Ozlem Yesiltas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"This paper explores the phenomenon of particle creation associated with cosmic strings in de Sitter spacetime, a model that represents the universe exponential expansion. We examine how the presence of cosmic strings in a de Sitter background affects particle production, focusing on the roles of string tension and angular deficits. Utilizing the Klein Gordon equation adapted to curved spacetime with cosmic string defects, we derive solutions expressed through hypergeometric functions to describe particle states. Our findings highlight how string properties influence particle creation rates and energy distributions. By analyzing both point-like and linear potentials near the string, we determine exact solutions, investigate asymptotic behaviors, and calculate particle creation probabilities using Bogoliubov transformations.",
New submissions,Observer in quantum cosmology,"Natalia Gorobey,Alexander Lukyanenko,Alexander V. Goltsev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Within the framework of the new formalism of quantum theory - the quantum principle of least action - the initial state of the universe is determined, which is an analogue of the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary wave function. The quantum evolution of the universe is modified by an additional condition in a certain compact region of space-time, which is called the observation region. The additional condition is the covariant conservation law of the energy-momentum tensor of matter. The consequence of this is the deterministic nature of the motion of the energy and momentum densities of matter in the observation region. The geometric parameters of the region boundary are also determined by the deterministic motion of the matter fields inside. The choice of boundary conditions for the energy-momentum flow at the boundary serves as a mechanism for decoherence of the quantum evolution of the universe. The result of decoherence is a certain correspondence of the final state of the universe, including its norm, to the state of the observer in the specified region. It is proposed to use the norm of the final state as an action functional in quantum cosmology, which determines the world history of the universe as it is seen by the observer.",
New submissions,"Reconstructing cosmic expansion in $f(R, G)$ gravity using a log-periodic deceleration model","Amit Samaddar,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the late-time cosmology in $f(R, G)=R+\alpha R^{2}+\beta e^{\gamma G}$, using a logarithmic parametrization of the deceleration parameter $q(z)=q_{0}+q_{1}sin[log(1+z)]$. The Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is reconstructed and model parameters are constrained via MCMC analysis using CC ($31$), BAO ($26$) and Pantheon+SHOES ($1701$) datasets. Our results yield a Hubble constant in the range $H_0 = 71.7$--$72.8$ km/s/Mpc, consistent with late-time observations. The present deceleration parameter is found to be $q_{0}=-0.484$ to $-0.517$, while the evolution parameter $q_{1}\approx 1$, indicating increasing acceleration. The transition redshift shifts from $z_{tr}=0.879$ (CC) to $0.744$ (CC+BAO+Pantheon+SHOES), supporting a dynamic acceleration phase. The model reproduces early radiation behavior with $\omega (z>>1) \approx 0.33$ and predicts present-day values $\omega_{0} \approx -0.49$. Energy conditions NEC and DEC are satisfied, while SEC is violated at late times. The statefinder parameters $\{r_0, s_0\} = (0.866, 0.046)$ lie near the $\Lambda$CDM point. Estimated age of the Universe ranges from $13.01$ to $13.59$ Gyr. Thermodynamic analysis confirms consistency with the generalized second law. Overall, the model offers a viable and observationally consistent description of cosmic acceleration.",
New submissions,"Cosmological insights from an exponential $Om(z)$ function in $f(T,T_{G})$ gravity framework","Amit Samaddar,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We examine a modified teleparallel gravity model defined by $f(T,T_{G})=T+\gamma\sqrt{T_{G}}+\delta\sqrt{T}$ by introducing an exponential $Om(z)$ diagnostic of the form $Om(z)=\alpha e^{\frac{z}{1+z}}+\beta$. This novel form captures smooth redshift evolution and allows for a flexible, model-independent probe of dark energy dynamics. We derive a Hubble function from this expression and use MCMC analysis with $31$ CC, $26$ BAO and $1701$ Pantheon+ data points to constrain the model parameters. The best-fit results yield $H_{0} \in [68.46, 77.38]$km/s/Mpc for $\alpha \in [-0.232, -0.068]$ and $\beta \in [0.218, 0.560]$ which is consistent with local $H_{0}$ values. Our model predicts a transition redshift $z_{tr} \approx (0.48-0.54)$, present $q_{0}\approx -0.34$, and $\omega_{0}\approx-0.33$. It satisfies NEC and DEC, closely tracks $\Lambda$CDM in the statefinder plane and estimates a cosmic age of $(13.28-13.87)$ Gyr which confirms its strength in explaining late-time acceleration. Our findings demonstrate that the exponential $Om(z)$ parameterization provides a robust and insightful approach to trace dark energy evolution within modified gravity frameworks.",
New submissions,Constraint instabilities in first-order viscous relativistic fluids,"Delfina Fantini,Marcelo E. Rubio",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Relativistic hydrodynamics provides a solid framework for evolving matter and energy in a wide variety of phenomena. Nevertheless, the inclusion of dissipative effects in realistic scenarios through causal, stable, and well-posed theories still constitutes an open problem. In this paper, we point out that the first-order reduction originally proposed by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha and Kovtun (BDNK) for proving the local well-posedness of conformally-invariant viscous fluids in Sobolev spaces, admits a set of differential constraints which do not propagate along evolution. To see so, we first show analytically that this is the case for uniform-velocity configurations. Motivated by this result, we perform numerical simulations of the BDNK first-order reduction restricted to plane-symmetric configurations in Minkowski spacetime. We report on initial data sets which satisfy the constraints, but display exponential grow at early times. Thus, although the principal part of the reduction is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues --as proved by BDNK--, the corresponding differential constraints appearing from it are not conserved along evolution. This result suggests that an alternative path is needed to prove the strong-hyperbolicity for the conformal version of the theory.",
New submissions,Stability and collisions of excited spherical boson stars: glimpses of chains and rings,"Marco Brito,Carlos Herdeiro,Eugen Radu,Nicolas Sanchis-Gual,Miguel Zilhão",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Scalar, spherically symmetric, radially excited boson stars were previously shown to be stabilized, against spherical dynamics, by sufficiently strong self-interactions. Here, we further test their stability now in a full 3+1D evolution. We show that the stable stars in the former case become afflicted by a non-spherical instability. Then, we perform head-on collisions of both (stable) fundamental and (sufficiently long-lived) excited boson stars. Depending on the stars chosen, either a black hole or a bosonic remnant are possible. In particular, collisions of excited stars result in a bosonic bound state which resembles a dynamical superposition of chains and rings, akin to the ones found as equilibrium solutions in Liang:2025myf. These evolutions emphasize a key difference concerning the dynamical robustness of fundamental vs. excited spherical boson stars, when generic (beyond spherical) dynamics is considered.",
New submissions,New Methods for Offline GstLAL Analyses,"Prathamesh Joshi,Leo Tsukada,Chad Hanna,Shomik Adhicary,Debnandini Mukherjee,Wanting Niu,Shio Sakon,Divya Singh,Pratyusava Baral,Amanda Baylor,Kipp Cannon,Sarah Caudill,Bryce Cousins,Jolien D. E. Creighton,Becca Ewing,Heather Fong,Richard N. George,Patrick Godwin,Reiko Harada,Yun-Jing Huang,Rachael Huxford,James Kennington,Soichiro Kuwahara,Alvin K. Y. Li,Ryan Magee,Duncan Meacher,Cody Messick,Soichiro Morisaki,Alexander Pace,Cort Posnansky,Anarya Ray,Surabhi Sachdev,Stefano Schmidt,Urja Shah,Ron Tapia,Koh Ueno,Aaron Viets,Leslie Wade,Madeline Wade,Zach Yarbrough,Noah Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"In this work, we present new methods implemented in the GstLAL offline gravitational wave search. These include a technique to reuse the matched filtering data products from a GstLAL online analysis, which hugely reduces the time and computational resources required to obtain offline results; a technique to combine these results with a separate search for heavier black hole mergers, enabling detections from a larger set of gravitational wave sources; changes to the likelihood ratio which increases the sensitivity of the analysis; and two separate changes to the background estimation, allowing more precise significance estimation of gravitational wave candidates. Some of these methods increase the sensitivity of the analysis, whereas others correct previous mis-estimations of sensitivity by eliminating false positives. These methods have been adopted for GstLAL's offline results during the fourth observing run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (O4). To test these new methods, we perform an offline analysis over one chunk of O3 data, lasting from May 12 19:36:42 UTC 2019 to May 21 14:45:08 UTC 2019, and compare it with previous GstLAL results over the same period of time. We show that cumulatively these methods afford around a 50% - 100% increase in sensitivity in the highest mass space, while simultaneously increasing the reliability of results, and making them more reusable and computationally cheaper.",
New submissions,Lecture Notes in Loop Quantum Gravity. LN3: Boundary equations for Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi model,"L.Fatibene,A.Orizzonte",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We shall here perform the canonical analysis of field equations of ABI model in order to determine constraint equations. We shall show that one can use algebraic constraints in the covariant framework to fix $k^i$ as a function of the frame and obtain a model where $(A^i_a, E_i^a)$ is a pair of independent fields which are also a pair of conjugated fields.We shall not impose any relation on Immirzi parameter $\beta$ and Holst parameter $\gamma$, still constraint equations will depend on $\beta$ only and they agree with standard result of LQG which are obtained by a suitable canonical transformation on a leaf of the ADM foliation used to define a Hamiltonian framework. We eventually state the scheme for quantization that will be discussed in the following lecture notes.",
New submissions,Reducing the irreducible: the charged black hole bomb in a moving cavity,"Nicolas Sanchis-Gual,Alejandro Belchí,Carlos Herdeiro,José A. Font",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We revisit the charged black hole bomb by numerically solving the fully non-linear Einstein-Maxwell-(charged, complex) Klein-Gordon system with a moving mirror. By dynamically varying the cavity size, we find that the system evolves toward new hairy black hole equilibria. Expanding the mirror radius enhances superradiant extraction, increasing both the scalar field charge and the black hole's irreducible mass. Remarkably, on the other hand, shrinking the cavity size has the opposite effect: the black hole is able to reduce its irreducible mass as more charge than energy flows back from the field, without violating charge conservation or energy conditions. As a consistency check, in the limit of a vanishing cavity, we find that the system returns to the original Reissner-Nordström configuration. We discuss the implications of these findings for black hole thermodynamics in confined configurations where superradiant modes exist and the limitations of this setup, particularly in relation to Hawking's black hole area theorem.",
New submissions,Black-hole hair from vector dark matter accretion,"Fredric Hancock,Helvi Witek",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We model a single black hole in equilibrium with a dark photon-cold dark matter environment. Representing the dark photon as a Proca field, we show that a Schwarzschild black hole grows vector-field ""hair"" when allowed to accrete from an infinite homogeneous bath of particles far from the horizon. We solve the Proca equation in linear perturbation theory, separating it using the vector spherical harmonics and Frolov-Krtouš-Kubizňák-Santos approaches for the odd-parity and even-parity sectors, respectively. In the ""particle"" dark matter regime, the field is purely infalling and exhibits a sharply peaked density profile, in concordance with the particle dark matter ""spikes"" studied in the literature. In the ""wave"" regime, the field exhibits standing waves, and the profile is smeared. We find a dark-matter density amplification upward of $10^7$ near the horizon. Though small for most black holes, we find the mass enclosed in the cloud can reach $\sim 1 \%$ of the black hole mass for large supermassive black holes. These black holes are also most susceptible to vector dark matter accretion, with mass accretion rates as large as $10 M_\odot/$yr.",
New submissions,Time Delay of Pulsar Signals in Astrophysical Black Hole Spacetimes,"Parth Bambhaniya,Viraj Kalsariya,Saurabh,Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino,Ivan De Martino,Riccardo Della Monica,Mariafelicia De Laurentis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate the fully relativistic time delay of pulsar signals propagating in the vicinity of a rotating black hole and its potential mimickers, including a deformed Kerr black hole and the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity. We aim to compute and compare the pulsar time delays caused by different spacetime geometries to explore possible observational signatures that distinguish between black holes and their alternatives. We begin by solving the equations of motion for null geodesics in these background geometries. Subsequently, we address the emitter-observer problem to compute the time delay of pulsar signals in Kerr, deformed Kerr, and JNW spacetimes. A comparative analysis between Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes allows us to observe the effect of spin on propagation delay in pulsar timing. Further, we examine the impact of the deformation parameter in the deformed Kerr black hole and the influence of the scalar field on the rotating JNW spacetime. Our study considers both direct and indirect photons emitted by a source in the equatorial circular orbit. We find that the variations in the spin parameter show very small but detectable changes when we compare the time delay cases of a Kerr black hole with deformed Kerr and rotating JNW spacetimes. Our pulsar time delay results suggest a potential observable distinguishing feature of these astrophysical black hole geometries which could be useful for the forthcoming observational facilities such as Square Kilometer Array Observatory, Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope and Event Horizon Telescope.",
New submissions,The de Sitter Weak Gravity Conjecture from 3-Form Black Holes and Inflation with Higher-Derivative Corrections,"Nutthaphat Lunrasri,Chakrit Pongkitivanichkul",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the interplay between the de Sitter (dS) Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and slow-roll inflation within a framework governed by a 3-form gauge field. Starting from classical considerations, we derive an upper bound on the mass of extremal charged black holes in dS spacetime which constrains the admissible parameter space. To incorporate quantum gravity effects, we introduce higher-derivative corrections to the 3-form action and obtain additional bounds on these terms, ensuring consistency with swampland criteria. We further analyze these corrections from a thermodynamic perspective, confirming that the Wald entropy remains compatible with the classical extremality bound. Extending this setup to cosmological inflation, we examine the scalar dual of the 3-form in both large-field and small-field regimes. In the large-field limit, the potential acquires a Higgs-like structure that supports slow-roll inflation. In contrast, the small-field limit leads to an effective potential with an AdS minimum, rendering it inconsistent with the dS swampland constraints. Notably, we find that the dS WGC can impose constraints more stringent than those derived from inflationary dynamics alone. These results underscore the utility of swampland-inspired principles in shaping viable models of early universe cosmology.",
New submissions,Across the Horizon: On Gravitational Wave Flux Laws and Tests of Gravity,David Maibach,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Motivated by the first detection of gravitational waves, this dissertation develops analytical, numerical, and data analysis techniques to address persistent blind spots in our understanding of gravity. Beginning with asymptotically flat spacetimes and the geometry of null geodesic congruences, the derivation of the shear tensor--encoding gravitational radiation--is revisited. The covariant phase space formulation of General Relativity is then employed to derive a non-conservation law associated with the symmetry group at null infinity, generalizing prior constructions of radiative phase space and yielding consistent results. These flux laws are used to derive constraint equations that enable the evaluation and comparison of state-of-the-art numerical waveform models, leading to new insights and a robust algorithm for benchmarking future improvements. These flux laws are further applied to compute quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms arising from the gravitational wave echo effect. Two leading phenomenological scenarios involving echoes from binary black hole mergers are analyzed. The structure of both the primary echo signal and its induced corrections to nonlinear features of the waveform are studied for observability by the upcoming LISA mission. The results indicate that LISA could detect such signals, potentially probing black hole area quantization. Finally, motivated by recent hints of a stochastic gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Array data, this work reviews its theoretical basis and studies several astrophysical and cosmological source scenarios. A forecast for detection prospects with LISA is presented using a modern data analysis pipeline. The results suggest LISA will constrain the extra-galactic stochastic background to a spectral energy density below $ \Omega_\text{GW} \lesssim 10^{-8}$.",
New submissions,AthenaK simulations of the binary black hole merger GW150914,"David Radice,Rossella Gamba,Hengrui Zhu,Alireza Rashti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present new binary black hole simulations targeted to GW150914 using the GPU-accelerated code \texttt{AthenaK}. We compute the properties of the final remnant with the isolated horizon formalism and obtain gravitational-waveforms at future null infinity via Cauchy characteristic extraction. We compare our results with those obtained by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) and Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) groups, targeted to the same event. We find excellent agreement in the remnant mass, spin, and recoil velocity. For the dominant $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ mode of the gravitational-wave signal we find maximum dephasing of $\Delta \phi \simeq 0.35$ and amplitude difference of $\Delta A/A \simeq 0.4\%$. We use our newly computed waveform to re-analyze the GW150914 data and find posteriors for chirp mass, luminosity distance, and inclination that are broadely consistent with those obtained using semi-analytic waveform models. This work demonstrates the viability of \texttt{AthenaK} for many-orbits binary black hole merger simulations. A step-by-step tutorial, including all necessary input files and analysis scripts to reproduce our results, is available on \texttt{GitHub}.",
New submissions,Correspondence between new agegraphic and Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in the context of $f(T)$ gravity,Alireza Amani,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In this paper, we study the universe in the context of $f(T)$ gravity with flat-FRW background and consider it to be a combination of three components: baryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy. We consider the new agegraphic as an alternative for dark energy and the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) as an alternative for dark matter. After that, first we obtain the Friedman equations and then we obtain the continuity equations in the presence of the interaction term between the dark components of the universe, so that the interaction term is considered as the flow of energy from dark matter to dark energy. In what follows, we plot the variation of the cosmological parameters of dark energy in terms of the redshift parameter by using of the power-law cosmology. Finally, we investigate the evolution and stability of the universe and report the values of the density parameters of the universe components that confirm the present model with observational data.",
New submissions,Phase Diffusion of Light Immersed In Quantum Tides: Open Quantum System Approach,"Fateme Shojaei Arani,Brahim Lamine,Alain Blanchard,Malek Bagheri Harouni",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The interaction between quantum gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) fields is investigated within the open quantum system formalism, where GWs are considered as a heat bath reservoir occupying a generic state $\hat{\rho}_{\text{gws}}$. Following the quantum Langevin equations, it turns out that the correlations of the Langevin noise operator associated with the GW background directly determine the statistical properties of the EM phasor $\phi(t)$. We apply this formalism to the background of inflationary-generated primordial gravitational waves (PGW). Since this background has an astronomically large correlation time, of the order of the Hubble time $H_0^{-1}$, we show that it leads to a non-Markovian dynamics of the EM field, which causes memory effects. As a result of the Gaussianity of PGW, it turns out that the EM phasor goes through a stochastic process, which is a manifestation of the fluctuation-dissipation in EM-GW system. The variance of the EM phase smears out as $\Delta^2\varphi(t)= \Delta^2\varphi_0+ 4(t/\tau_c)^4$, where the characteristic time scale $\tau_c$ is associated with the diffusion rate caused by PGWs. The specific quartic growth of the phase noise is thus attributed to the two-mode squeezed nature of PGWs, which is inherently different from the phase diffusion induced by vacuum fluctuations of spacetime or a thermal heat bath of gravitons.",
New submissions,Overcoming Barriers: Kramers' Escape Rate Analysis of Metastable Dynamics in First-Order Multi-Phase Transitions,"Mohammad Ali S. Afshar,Saeed Noori Gashti,Mohammad Reza Alipour,Jafar Sadeghi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The expanding application of classical thermodynamic methods to black hole physics has yielded significant advances in characterizing phase transition behavior. Among these approaches, thermodynamic analysis -- particularly kinetic formulations like the Kramers' escape rate -- provides a robust framework for probing black hole phase transitions with minimal relativistic constraints. This study investigates the kinetics and dynamic evolution of first-order phase transitions in black holes exhibiting multiple critical points, employing a particle-based escape rate model. The distinct free energy landscapes inherent to multi-critical systems, which can simultaneously support multiple local minima under specific thermodynamic conditions (temperature and pressure) within a given reference frame, raise fundamental questions regarding transition pathways. We rigorously assess whether the Kramers' escape rate retains its predictive validity in these complex multi-minima systems, as established for conventional single-minimum configurations. Furthermore, we examine whether transitions proceed via a sequential, stepwise mechanism between adjacent minima, or if pathways exist that bypass intermediate states through direct descent to the global minimum. Our analysis of black holes undergoing multiphase transitions reveals both parallels and significant deviations from single-transition models. Crucially, we demonstrate that the Kramers' escape rate remains a quantitatively reliable indicator of first-order phase transitions in black holes, even within multi-critical frameworks. This approach offers deeper insights into the governing energetic landscapes and kinetic processes underlying these phenomena.",
New submissions,A new exact rotating spacetime in vacuum: The Kerr--Levi-Civita Spacetime,"José Barrientos,Adolfo Cisterna,Mokhtar Hassaine,Keanu Müller,Konstantinos Pallikaris",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We construct a new rotating solution of Einstein's theory in vacuum by exploiting the Lie point symmetries of the field equations in the complex potential formalism of Ernst. In particular, we perform a discrete symmetry transformation, known as inversion, of the gravitational potential associated with the Kerr metric. The resulting metric describes a rotating generalization of the Schwarzschild--Levi-Civita spacetime, and we refer to it as the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric. We study the key geometric features of this novel spacetime, which turns out to be free of curvature singularities, topological defects, and closed timelike curves. These attractive properties are also common to the extremal black hole and the super-spinning case. The solution is algebraically general (Petrov-type I), and its horizon structure is exactly that of the Kerr spacetime. The ergoregions, however, are strongly influenced by the Levi-Civita-like asymptotic structure, producing an effect akin to the magnetized Kerr--Newman and swirling solutions. Interestingly, while its static counterpart permits a Kerr--Schild representation, the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric does not admit such a formulation.",
New submissions,Quenched entanglement harvesting,"Adrian Lopez-Raven,Robert B. Mann,Jorma Louko",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice, with a sudden position-dependent change (a quench) in the effective dispersion relation, have been proposed by Rodríguez-Laguna et al as an analogue spacetime test of the Unruh effect. We provide new support for this analogue by analysing the entanglement of a scalar field in a (1 + 1)-dimensional continuum spacetime with a similar quench, and the harvesting of this entanglement by a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We present numerical evidence that the concurrence and mutual information harvested by the detectors are qualitatively similar to those in Rindler spacetime, but they exhibit a small yet noticeable variation when the energy pulse created by the quench crosses the detectors. These findings provide further motivation to implement the experimental proposal of Rodríguez-Laguna et al.",
New submissions,Hamiltonian equations of motion of quadratic gravity,Jorge Bellorin,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We compute explicitly the equations of motion of the Hamiltonian formulation of quadratic gravity. This is the theory with the most general Lagrangian with terms of quadratic order in the curvature tensor. We employ the symbolic computational tool Cadabra. We present the linearized version of the equations of motion, performing the longitudinal-transverse decomposition. We compare the linear equations with the covariant field equations, finding that, if general-relativity terms are active, the linear Hamiltonian formulation is valid only if the perturbative spatial metric is traceless, a condition that can be freely imposed by recurring to an arbitrary function. We apply the equations of motion on homogeneous and isotropic configurations, finding explicit solutions.",
New submissions,Charged scalar boson in Melvin universe,"L. G. Barbosa,L. C. N. Santos,J. V. Zamperlini,F. M da Silva,C. C. Barros Jr",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work investigates the dynamics of a charged scalar boson in the Melvin universe by solving the Klein-Gordon equation with minimal coupling in both inertial and non-inertial frames. Non-inertial effects are introduced through a rotating reference frame, resulting in a modified spacetime geometry and the appearance of a critical radius that limits the radial domain of the field. Analytical solutions are obtained under appropriate approximations, and the corresponding energy spectra are derived. The results indicate that both the magnetic field and non-inertial effects modify the energy levels, with additional contributions depending on the coupling between the rotation parameter and the quantum numbers. A numerical analysis is also presented, illustrating the behavior of the solutions for two characteristic magnetic field scales: one that may be considered extreme, of the order of the ones proposed to be produced in heavy-ion collisions and another near the Planck scale.",
New submissions,Scalar Particles on embedded submanifolds,"Li Wang,Jun Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We derive Klein-Gordon equation and Schrödinger equation on curved manifolds embedded in high-dimensional manifolds to describe the motion of constrained spineless particles.

New submissions,Butterfly in Spacetime: Inherent Instabilities in Stable Black Holes,"Zhan-Feng Mai,Run-Qiu Yang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This paper numerically studies the time evolution of s-wave scalar probe field in a black hole of which the event horizon is surrounded by matter. As a toy model, it encodes the effects of matter into deformations of Regge-Wheeler potential. It considers three different types of local deformations in the vicinity of the event horizon, the negative static bump potential, the stochastic potential and bump potential modulated by time function in low frequency limit. Our numerical results show that infinitesimal local deformations on Regge-Wheeler potential near the horizon can overturn stability of an arbitrarily strongly stable black hole, implying that late-time behavior of a stable black hole is extremely sensitive to geometry near horizon. Specially, certain deformations that stabilize systems in flat backgrounds can destabilize otherwise stable black holes. It also shows that horizon-induced redshift transforms near-horizon quantum fluctuations into classical-scale stochastic deformations capable of triggering instability, implying that even an isolated black hole cannot keep stable in extended timescales.",
New submissions,Open quantum battery in the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole,"Xiaofang Liu,Zehua Tian,Jieci Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We investigate the charging performance of a quantum battery (QB) coupled to a scalar field under the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole. It is shown that under Dirichlet boundary conditions, when the QB's energy level spacing is smaller than the charging amplitude, the black hole rotation enhances the charging performance at finite times, whereas in other parameter regimes, it degrades the charging performance. Notably, as the black hole approaches extremal rotation, charging performance undergoes significant amplification or suppression, depending on the parameter regime. This indicates that the performance of QBs can probe critical properties of black holes. Additionally, regarding the energy flow in QB, it is further demonstrated that the energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations via dissipation, and rotation suppresses the QB's capacity to extract this energy. Our findings not only advance the relativistic dissipation dynamics of QBs but also propose a novel method to detect black hole rotation and extremal-state transitions.",
New submissions,Absence of curvature singularities in symmetric perfect fluid spacetimes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity,"Aavishkar Madhunlall,Chevarra Hansraj,Rituparno Goswami,Sunil D. Maharaj",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper we study the higher dimensional homogeneous and isotropic perfect fluid spacetimes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. We solve the modified field equations with higher order curvature terms to determine the evolution of the scale factor. We transparently show that this scale factor cannot become smaller than a finite minimum positive value which depends on the dimension and equation of state. This bound completely eliminates any curvature singularities in the spacetimes, where the scale factor must tend to zero. This is a unique property of EGB gravity which, despite being ghost-free and having quasi-linear field equations like general relativity, allows for the violation of singularity theorems. This phenomenon, thus, gives a natural way to dynamically construct regular black holes via higher dimensional continual gravitational collapse.",
New submissions,"$f(R, G, T)$ Gravity: Cosmological Implications and Dynamical System Analysis","Ratul Mandal,Himanshu Chaudhary,Tiberiu Harko,Ujjal Debnath,G. Mustafa",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider the cosmological implications of a four-dimensional extension of the Gauss-Bonnet f(G) gravity, where $G$ is the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant, in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by an arbitrary function $f(R,G,T)$ of G, of the Ricci scalar $R$, and of the trace $T$ of the matter energy-momentum tensor. By construction, the extended Gauss-Bonnet type action involves a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry. The field equations of the model are obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric. The generalized Friedmann equations, describing the cosmological evolution in the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry, are also presented in their general form. We investigate the cosmological evolution of the Universe in the generalized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theiry for a specific choice of the Lagrangian density, as given by $f(R, G, T) = \alpha_1 G + \alpha_2 R^{\beta} - 2\alpha_3 \sqrt{-T}$, where $\alpha_i$ (for $i = 1, 2, 3$) are model parameters. First, the theoretical predictions of the model are compared with a set of observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type IA Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) via an MCMC analysis, which allows us to obtain constraints on the model parameters. A comparison with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM system is also performed. Next, the generalized Friedmann equations are reformulated as a dynamical system, and the properties of its critical points are studied by using the Lyapunov linear stability analysis. This investigation allows for the reconstruction of the Universe's history in this model, from the early inflationary era to the late accelerating phase. The statefinder diagnostic parameters for the model are also considered from the dynamical system perspective.",
New submissions,Gravitational collapse of Matter in the presence of Scalar field Dark energy,"Priyanka Saha(1),Dipanjan Dey(2),Kaushik Bhattacharya(1) ((1) Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur India, (2) Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study examines the gravitational collapse of an overdense dark matter region in a coupled scalar field dark energy scenario within a flat FLRW background. It finds that, depending on the initial conditions, some overdense regions avoid collapse and expand eternally with the background. The interior overdense region follows a closed FLRW metric, while its boundary is described by generalized Vaidya spacetime, which allows flux across the boundary while preserving the homogeneity of dark energy inside. Dark matter evolves as cold dark matter, but in non-minimal coupling, the modified Klein-Gordon equation alters dark energy evolution. The results highlight the impact of coupled dark energy on dark matter virialization and cosmic structure formation.",
New submissions,Cosmic Jets in General Relativity,Bahram Mashhoon,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In certain general relativistic time-dependent gravitational fields, free test particles can asymptotically line up relative to fiducial static observers and produce a cosmic jet whose speed approaches the speed of light. Two scenarios for the formation of these purely gravitational jets have thus far been theoretically demonstrated: the double-jet collapse scenario and the wave scenario that involves both a cosmic jet in the general direction of wave propagation as well as a counterjet in the opposite direction. These scenarios are briefly reviewed in this paper. Moreover, to elucidate the process of jet formation in these scenarios, we study the propagation of scalar fields in related gravitational fields in connection with the correspondence between the scalar wave perturbations and the motion of free test particles and null rays.",
New submissions,Spatial Correlation between Pulsars from Interfering Gravitational-Wave Sources in Massive Gravity,"Yu-Mei Wu,Yan-Chen Bi,Qing-Guo Huang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In the nanohertz band, the spatial correlations in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) produced by interfering gravitational waves (GWs) from multiple sources likely deviate from the traditional ones without interference under the assumption of an isotropic Gaussian ensemble. This work investigates the impact of such interference within the framework of massive gravity. Through simulations, we show that while the resulting correlation patterns can be described by Legendre expansions with coefficients that depend on the interference configuration, they remain predominantly quadrupolar (l = 2), with this feature becoming more pronounced as the graviton mass increases--reflecting both the tensorial polarizations and the modified GW dispersion. However, the interference introduces significant variability in the angular correlation, making it difficult to distinguish massive gravity from general relativity based on a single realization of the Universe. We conclude that beyond a fundamental constraint set by the PTA observation time, achieving a substantially tighter bound on the graviton mass is statistically challenging and observationally limited under realistic conditions.",
New submissions,Polymer Geodesic Motion in Schwarzschild Spacetime,"Lorenzo Boldorini,Corrado Marzano,Giovanni Montani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this paper we will study the geodesic motion of massive particles, in a Schwarzschild background, with a semi-classical quantum framework called ""Polymer Quantum Mechanics"" (PQM) in order to investigate the black hole phenomenology resulting from this formulation, which accounts for Planckian scale physics. In particular we studied two main scenarios, being the radial in-fall and circular orbits and their stability. In this framework, we built an effective Hamiltonian taking into account the polymer quantum effects, altering the classical equations of motion with Planckian scale corrections. As a main result, we obtained the existence of a classically forbidden region surrounding the event horizon, preventing particles from crossing it. Additionally, we discovered the presence of stable circular orbits below both the classical Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and the horizon (corresponding to closed time-like geodesics).",
New submissions,The stochastic gravitational wave background from QCD phase transition in the framework of higher-order GUP,"Zhong-Wen Feng,Long-Xiang Li,Shi-Yu Li",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by a first-order cosmological QCD phase transition in the early universe, within the framework of a new higher-order generalized uncertainty principle. This model predicts a minimal length scale for both positive and negative values of the deformation parameter $\beta$. However, our analysis shows that only positive $\beta$ leads to physically viable stochastic gravitational wave background spectra. We derive generalized uncertainty principle induced corrections to the radiation energy density and the Hubble expansion rate and analyze their impact on the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background signal. The results indicate that an increase in $\beta$ leads to a redshift in the peak frequency and a modest enhancement in the energy density. Finally, we examine the detectability of these modified signals by comparing them with the sensitivity curves of current and upcoming pulsar timing arrays. Our findings suggest that the stochastic gravitational wave background signal for positive $\beta$ values can be probed by observatories such as SKA, IPTA, and NANOGrav, offering a potential avenue for testing the effects of quantum gravity effects.",
Cross submissions,Thermodynamics of dyonic black holes in non-linear electrodynamics,"Lewis Croney,Ruth Gregory,Carlos J. Ramírez-Valdez",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate dyonic black holes in a weak field expansion of non-linear electrodynamics. The breadth of parameter space permits a rich thermodynamic structure, additional turning points and intricate phase phenomena. Energy conditions are employed to ensure the physical viability of solutions. Analytic special cases illustrate novel properties of black holes in non-linear electrodynamics, including modified extremal limit behaviour. Numerical solutions offer the most elaborate thermodynamic landscape, culminating in up to five turning points, and multiple reentrant phase transitions.",
Cross submissions,Momentum-space Metric Tensor from Nonadiabatic Evolution of Bloch Electrons,Yafei Ren,Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We reveal a fundamental geometric structure of momentum space arising from the nonadiabatic evolution of Bloch electrons. By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.",
Cross submissions,Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information,Tadashi Takayanagi,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.",
Cross submissions,The $α$-Attractor E-Model in Warm Inflation: Observational Viability from Planck 2018,"Bhargabi Saha,Malay K. Nandy",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We explore the inflationary evolution and observational viability of the $\alpha$-attractor E-model in the framework of warm inflation, focusing on both weak and strong dissipative regimes, with a dissipation coefficient linear in temperature. In the strong regime, we account for the growth of inflaton fluctuations due to coupling with the radiation bath via two different forms for the dissipation enhancement function: one associated with plateau-like potentials, and another motivated by the warm little inflation scenario. Employing slow roll conditions, we analytically derive the expressions for the key inflationary observables, the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in both dissipative regimes. The resulting theoretical trajectories on the $n_s$--$r$ plane are then juxtaposed with the contour plots obtained from Planck 2018 data in order to constrain the model parameter. Our analysis shows that the warm $\alpha$-attractor E-model remains compatible with observations in both dissipative regimes, with dissipation playing a crucial role in shifting the predictions and enlarging the viable parameter space, highlighting observational robustness of the model when extended to warm inflation.",
Cross submissions,Primordial Black Holes Save $R^2$ Inflation,"Kazunori Kohri,Xinpeng Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In light of the latest Planck-Atacama Cosmology Telescope (P-ACT) joint results on the primordial scalar power spectrum, we show that the $R^2$ inflation model extended with a non-minimally coupled scalar field $\chi$--namely the $R^2$-Higgs model--can yield a larger spectral index $n_s$ and a small positive running $\alpha_s$ at cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales, which are consistent with the data. This is because the $\chi$ field contributes a blue-tilted component to the primordial power spectrum which both modifies the large-scale power and, as a result, significantly enhances power on small scales. The consequent enhancement be large enough to lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $\lesssim 10^{20}\mathrm{g}$, accounting for all of the dark matter. Furthermore, future observations of the small-scale power spectrum, CMB spectral distortions, and stochastic gravitational waves will provide decisive tests of this model and its predictions for PBHs.",
Cross submissions,Quantum cosmological perturbations in bouncing models with mimetic dark matter,"Idaiane L. Machado,Dêivid R. da Silva,Nelson Pinto-Neto",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We calculate the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations originated from quantum vacuum fluctuations in bouncing scenarios proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology} in the framework of mimetic cosmology. We show that all physically relevant models produce scale invariant spectral indices, and amplitudes compatible with observations provided that the bounce occurs at length scales $t_0$ inside the physically reasonable interval $10^5 l_p < t_0 < 10^9 l_p$. We also show that by slightly modifying the scalar field potential proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology}, we can also obtain the observed red-tilted spectral index, with the same amplitude constraints. Hence, mimetic cosmology provides reasonable bouncing cosmological models without the need of any background quantum effect.",

We calculate the analytical form of the one-loop effective potential responsible for the first step of symmetry breaking and show that it can lead to a first-order phase transition with gravitational wave production. We also determine the gravitational wave background produced by the primordial plasma of relativistic particles. The present experimental sensitivity is still far from the expected signals but could be in reach of novel detector concepts.,
Cross submissions,CMB line-of-sight integrators for nearly-isotropic cosmological models,"João G. Vicente,Thiago S. Pereira,Cyril Pitrou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Homogeneous and nearly-isotropic cosmological models are natural extensions of standard Friedmann cosmologies. Constraining their features is crucial, as any detection of their properties would impact our understanding of inflation and the cosmological principle. Since these models evolve as a set of non-interacting scalar, vector, and tensor modes on top of homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, their imprints on cosmological observables, particularly the CMB, can be obtained using standard line-of-sight methods. This requires (1) that one resorts on Laplacian eigenmodes on spatially curved spaces and (2) that radial functions for these modes are analytically continued to accommodate complex (i.e., supercurvature) wavenumbers. We introduce two line-of-sight integrators implementing the evolution of the CMB anisotropies in these models: \texttt{AniLoS}, a user-friendly and easy to modify \texttt{Python} package, and \texttt{AniCLASS}, an advanced and efficient extension of the Boltzmann solver \texttt{CLASS}. We discuss possible initial conditions that could generate such fluctuations and provide illustrative examples using our codes. This work offers a pathway for leveraging diverse cosmological datasets to constrain superhorizon anisotropies of the late-time universe.",
Cross submissions,Photon rings in a holographic toy model,"Stéphane Detournay,Sahaja Kanuri,Alexandru Lupsasca,Philippe Spindel,Quentin Vandermiers,Raphaela Wutte",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Light circling around an astrophysical black hole can spend a long time skirting its unstably bound photon orbits before escaping to infinity. To a distant observer, this orbiting light would appear as a bright ring encircling the image of the black hole. Though not yet resolved by radio-interferometric observations from the ground, this ``photon ring'' will be the target of future space-based black hole observations. Motivated by this experimental prospect, studies have sought to elucidate the theoretical connections between the photon ring -- an observable, classical effect -- and the putative holographic description of black holes in quantum gravity. General relativity predicts that the detailed structure of the photon ring encodes the high-frequency (eikonal) spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs) emitted by a perturbed black hole as it rings down, and also that the photon ring displays an emergent conformal symmetry that acts upon this spectrum. In holography, the classical QNM frequencies are expected to map to Ruelle resonances of the dual quantum theory. In this paper, we explore these connections in a lower-dimensional toy model based on Warped AdS$_3$ black holes that shares many features with the (3+1)-dimensional Kerr background -- including a photon ring at finite radius -- while still providing analytic control of the QNM frequencies.",
