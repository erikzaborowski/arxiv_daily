New submissions,Strange quark stars in mimetic gravitational theory,"Meghanil Sinha,S. Surendra Singh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This paper presents a novel anisotropic quark star model in the backdrop of mimetic gravitational theory. Our study focuses on the strange quark stars using the MIT bag equation of state (EoS) admitting non-singular Buchdahl metric function. The proposed model matches the interior spacetime of the strange quark star with the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. Our analysis of the energy conditions, radial and tangential EoSs along with the energy momentum tensor gradients and TOV equilibrium condition analysis support the model's physical validity. Further study of adiabatic index, surface redshift function and speed of sound analysis have demonstrated the stability of the strange quark star in mimetic gravity. Thus, we can say that the model stability and consistency have been validated for various parameter values of the Buchdahl function throughout our study in the context of mimetic gravity.",
New submissions,Detecting regular precession using a new gravitational waveform model directly parameterized by both precession amplitude and frequency,"Tamanjyot Singh,Evangelos Stoikos,Saif Ali,Nathan Steinle,Michael Kesden,Lindsay King",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Nearly 210 binary black hole (BBH) mergers have been observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network during its four observing runs. Generic BBHs are spinning, and their spins are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$. These misaligned spins cause $\vec{L}$ to precess in a cone with dimensionless precession amplitude $\tilde{\theta}$ and frequency $\tilde{\Omega}$ about the nearly constant direction of the total angular momentum. This precession modulates the observed GWs. We propose a model of regularly precessing (RP) waveforms that incorporates $\tilde{\theta}$ and $\tilde{\Omega}$ directly as parameters. We investigate how these waveforms vary as functions of these precessional parameters, as well as binary orientation and sky location. We use the Lindblom criterion to estimate that precession can be detected in a RP source with signal-to-noise ratio $\rho$ when the mismatch $\epsilon$ with a non-precessing (NP) source with otherwise identical parameters exceeds $1/2\rho^2$. Precession is most detectable when $\vec{L}$ precesses through configurations we call +~nulls during the inspiral. At +~nulls, a NP source only emits +-polarization to which the GW detector is insensitive. The large mismatch between a RP source and this vanishing NP signal enhances the detectability of precession. We also explore the detectability of precession as a function of redshift $z$ for different BBH populations. We find that for BBHs with isotropically oriented maximal spins, precession is detectable in a majority of systems out to $z \approx 0.3$ for chirp masses $10 \lesssim M_c/M_\odot \lesssim 40$ and mass ratios $q \gtrsim 0.5$. Reduced spin magnitudes or greater alignment between the spins and $\vec{L}$ make it difficult to observe beyond $z \approx 0.1$. (abridged)",
New submissions,Imprints of quantum vacuum fluctuations on the gravitational field of a spherical mass,"RaÃºl Carballo-Rubio,Francesco Di Filippo,Shinji Mukohyama,Kazumasa Okabayashi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The Schwarzschild geometry, describing the gravitational field of a spherical mass in classical vacuum, is one of the most famous vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations. Classical vacuum is an idealization that does not include quantum vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields, and determining the form of the gravitational field of a spherical mass in quantum vacuum is an important step towards understanding the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory. We formulate and prove general results on the space of static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetimes sourced by quantum vacuum fluctuations, obtained under the broad assumptions that the quantum vacuum energy density is negative and unbounded on Killing horizons. In particular, we show the generic replacement of Killing horizons by wormhole throats. We discuss how previous calculations in the literature that have used different prescriptions for the regularized vacuum expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor are particular cases of our general results.",
New submissions,Spin-induced Quadrupole Moment (SIQM) Test for Eccentric Compact Binaries,"Syed U. Naqvi,Chandra Kant Mishra",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Spin-induced deformations of individual components of a binary can be quantified using the gravitational wave signal the binary emits. Such deformations are characterised by a parameter, $ \kappa $, which takes a value of 1 for a black hole and thus its measurement can be used to test the no-hair conjecture. However, in practice, only a symmetric combination of this parameter for a binary ($ \kappa_s $) can be measured, thus instead enabling a test for the no-hair conjecture in the context of a binary black hole system; see for instance, Krishnendu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 091101 (2017),arXiv:1701.06318. While previous studies have focused on circular binaries, we extend this test to eccentric systems in a Fisher matrix based analysis. We find that the error in the measurement of the parameter $ \kappa_s $ reduces from a value of about 18% (for the circular case) to close to 8% (4%) for a $ 10 M_{\odot} $ system with dimensionless component spins $ >0.8 $ and with a reference initial eccentricity ($ e_0 $) of 0.2 (0.4) evaluated at 5 Hz for a third generation detector, Cosmic Explorer (CE). Compared to the estimates obtained by using Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, eccentricity and the overall improved sensitivity of CE detectors together seem to improve these estimates almost by an order of magnitude.",
New submissions,Probing For Non-Gravitational Long-Range Dark Matter Interactions,"M.P. Ross,E.A. Shaw,C. Gettings,S.K. Apple,I.A. Paulson,J.H. Gundlach",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Dark matter remains a mystery in fundamental physics. The only evidence for dark matter's existence is from gravitational interactions. We constructed a precision torsion balance experiment to search for non-gravitational, long-range interactions between ordinary matter in our lab and the Milky Way's dark matter. We find no evidence of such interaction and set strict upper bounds on its strength. These results suggest that dark matter only interacts gravitationally over long distances and constrains a variety of dark matter theories.",
New submissions,AdS Black Hole Solution with a Dark Matter Halo Surrounded by a Cloud of Strings,"Faizuddin Ahmed,Abdelmalek Bouzenada,Edilberto O. Silva",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We derive and analyze a Schwarzschild-like Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) obtained as a static, spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's equations sourced by a cloud of strings (CoS) and a dark matter (DM) halo modeled by a Dehnen-type density profile. We first study the geodesic motion of massless and massive test particles, emphasizing how the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the DM halo parameters $(\rho_s, r_s)$ influence photon spheres, circular orbits, the BH shadow, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We then examine scalar perturbations via the effective potential and the associated quasinormal-mode (QNM) spectra, showing how $\alpha$ and $(\rho_s, r_s)$ deform oscillation frequencies and damping rates, thereby affecting stability diagnostics. Furthermore, we investigate the thermodynamics in the extended phase space, deriving the Hawking temperature, equation of state, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity, and establishing a consistent first law and Smarr relation with natural work terms for $\alpha$ and $(\rho_s, r_s)$. We find that the interplay between the CoS and the DM halo produces quantitative and sometimes qualitative changes in both dynamical and thermodynamical properties, including shifts of the Hawking--Page transition and heat-capacity divergences, thus reshaping the phase structure of Schwarzschild--AdS BHs.",
New submissions,Black Hole Superradiance of Interacting Multi-Field,"Zhi-Qing Zhu,Yun-Song Piao,Jun Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We investigate black hole superradiance evolution of the interacting multiple fields. We consider a model of two scalar fields interacting with a cubic coupling, and study the superradiant evolution of the cloud. We demonstrate that superradiance is typically suppressed when the superradiant field couples to another field, even with a very weak coupling strength. This implies that the constraints on dark particles derived from single-field analyses can be revised in the presence of interactions. Moreover, we find that the multi-field superradiant evolution and its corresponding observational signatures can be different across parameter spaces, which makes black hole superradiance an even more powerful probe of the dark sector in particle physics.",
New submissions,Transformer Networks for Continuous Gravitational-wave Searches,"Prasanna. M. Joshi,Reinhard Prix",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Wide-parameter-space searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) using semi-coherent matched-filter methods require enormous computing power, which limits their achievable sensitivity. Here we explore an alternative search method based on training neural networks as classifiers on detector strain data with minimal pre-processing. Contrary to previous studies using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we investigate the suitability of the transformer architecture, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT). We establish sensitivity benchmarks using the matched-filter $\mathcal{F}$-statistic for ten targeted searches over a 10 day timespan, and ten directed and six all-sky searches over a 1 day timespan. We train ViTs on each of these benchmark cases. The trained ViTs achieve essentially matched-filter sensitivity on the targeted benchmarks, and approach the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic detection probability of $p_{\mathrm{det}}$ = 90% on the directed ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 85-89 %) and all-sky benchmarks ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 78-88 %). Unlike the CNNs in our previous studies, which required extensive manual design and hyperparameter tuning, the ViT achieves better performance with a standard architecture and minimal tuning.",
New submissions,Observable thin accretion disk around a self-dual black hole in loop quantum gravity,"Tursunali Xamidov,Javokhir Sharipov,Sanjar Shaymatov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we study a self-dual black hole (BH) in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), analyzing both timelike and null geodesics. Using observational data from Mercury's perihelion shift and the orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A$^{\star}$ (Sgr A$^{\star}$), we derive constraints on the polymeric function $P$. We further investigate photon trajectories near the self-dual BH under various scenarios to explore their observational relevance. Finally, we examine the properties of accretion disks around the self-dual BH in LQG, including their direct and secondary images, and study the redshift and the observed energy flux distribution across the accretion disk as measured by distant observers for different inclination angles. Our findings provide new insights into the physical nature and accretion properties of self-dual BHs in LQG and their possible observational consequences.",
New submissions,Topical Collection-Hyperboloidal Foliations in the Era of Gravitational-Wave Astronomy: From Mathematical Relativity to Astrophysics,"David Hilditch,Rodrigo Panosso Macedo,Alex VaÃ±Ã³-ViÃ±uales,AnÄ±l ZenginoÄlu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Editorial introducing the GRG Topical Collection ""Hyperboloidal foliations in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy,"" on hyperboloidal slices. The collection includes contributions spanning black-hole perturbations, asymptotic geometry, initial-data, and high-accuracy numerical methods relevant to gravitational-wave modeling. The collection grew out of the 2023 ""Infinity on a Gridshell"" workshop in Copenhagen.",
New submissions,Gravitational perturbations of Dymnikova black holes: grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections,Alexey Dubinsky,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study axial gravitational perturbations of the Dymnikova regular black hole, an asymptotically flat spacetime in which the Schwarzschild singularity is replaced by a de Sitter core. Using the WKB method with PadÃ© approximants, we compute grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections, and test the recently proposed correspondence between quasinormal frequencies and transmission coefficients. We find that variations of the quantum parameter \(l_{\rm cr}\) affect the effective potential only near the horizon, leading to minor deviations of grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections from the Schwarzschild case. As a result, the Hawking radiation spectrum is governed mainly by the modified Hawking temperature, with grey-body factors providing only subleading corrections. Unlike higher quasinormal overtones, which are highly sensitive to near-horizon deformations, the grey-body factors remain robust, a feature explicitly confirmed for the Dymnikova geometry. The correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors holds in our case with high accuracy for multipoles $\ell \geq 2$.",
New submissions,Time delay in matched exterior and interior Kottler solutions,Mourad Guenouche,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We extend the study of gravitational lensing to photons traversing the lens mass, modeled as a uniform-density fluid described by the interior Kottler (Schwarzschild--de Sitter) solution smoothly matched to the exterior Kottler region. An analytic expression for the time delay is derived, allowing the interior contribution to be explicitly isolated relative to the vacuum Kottler case. This correction is found to systematically enhance the total time delay, an effect corroborated by numerical evaluations for astrophysically relevant lenses at both galaxy and cluster scales. These results underscore the importance of accounting for the interior lens structure in accurate modeling of strong lensing time delays.",
New submissions,Analytical Perturbative Construction of Initial Data for Binary Black Holes up to Third Order in Spin and Momentum,"Leyla Ogurol,Tore Boybeyi,Bayram Tekin",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We analytically solve the constraints in General Relativity for two black holes with arbitrary momenta and spin up to third order in these parameters. We compute the location and geometry of the apparent horizon, which depend on the spins, momenta, relative orientation angles, and the separation between the black holes, and present the result in a coordinate-independent form. We also extract the ADM mass and the irreducible mass and verify their consistency. The final expressions are depicted in a coordinate-independent form. The results can be easily extended to any number of black holes and used to complement numerical relativity simulations.",
New submissions,An interstellar mission to the closest black hole?,Cosimo Bambi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"In this manuscript, I discuss the possibility of sending a small probe to the closest black hole with the goal of addressing some fundamental questions of modern physics. Are astrophysical black holes the Kerr black holes predicted by General Relativity? Do astrophysical black holes have an event horizon? Is the physics around a black hole the same physics as in our laboratories on Earth? While we do not have the technology for a similar mission today, it may be available in the next 20-30 years. The whole mission may last up to a century (depending on the actual distance of the black hole and the speed of the probe), but it may represent a unique opportunity to perform precise and accurate tests of General Relativity in the strong field regime.",
New submissions,Picosecond-level corrections to the Shapiro time delay in a Schwarzschild spacetime,Oscar del Barco,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present an exact analytical equation for the Shapiro time delay (STD) due to a spherical non-rotating body. As a result, accurate values of the STD in comparison with first and second-order expressions for Schwarzschild spacetime (1Sch and 2Sch) and first-order post-Newtonian formalism (1PN) are achieved. Accordingly, the lowest STD discrepancies between our exact equation and these approximations lie within the picosecond and sub-picosecond level for light beams affected by the Sun's gravity. Our results might be useful for time delay measurements in the solar system or extragalactic binary pulsar systems, where a high accuracy level is required.",
New submissions,Solving the Trans-Planckian Censorship Problem with a Power-law Tail in $R^2$ Inflation: A Dynamical System Approach,"S.D. Odintsov,V.K. Oikonomou,Eleni I. Manouri,Asterios T. Papadopoulos",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work we elaborate on solving the trans-Planckian censorship problem of standard slow-roll inflation by using a power-law inflationary tail generated by a scalar field with an exponential potential. We use a quantitative approach by studying in detail the phase space of a combined $F(R,\phi)$ cosmological system, focusing on the de Sitter and power-law subspaces of the total phase space. As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the $F(R,\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity system and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points. However, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the combined $F(R,\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated phenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off below a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary era, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term and the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian. The remaining system can successfully realize a power-law tail of the $R^2$ slow-roll era.",
New submissions,Gravitational collapse with torsion and universe in a black hole,Nikodem PopÅawski,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider gravitational collapse of a fluid sphere with torsion generated by spin, which forms a black hole. We use the Tolman metric and the Einstein$-$Cartan field equations with a relativistic spin fluid as a source. We show that gravitational repulsion of torsion prevents a singularity, replacing it with a nonsingular bounce. Quantum particle creation during contraction prevents shear from overcoming torsion. Particle creation during expansion can generate a finite period of inflation and produce large amounts of matter. The resulting closed universe on the other side of the event horizon may have several bounces. Such a universe is oscillatory, with each cycle larger than the preceding cycle, until it reaches a size at which dark energy dominates and expands indefinitely. Our Universe might have therefore originated from a black hole existing in another universe.",
New submissions,Charged particle dynamics in magnetosphere generated by current loop around Schwarzschild black hole,"Martin KoloÅ¡,David KofroÅ",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We present a theoretical study of the magnetic field generated by a toroidal current loop situated in the equatorial plane of a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, based on the dynamics of charged particles. Using the exact general relativistic solution for the magnetic field, we analyze particle motion both analytically and numerically, identifying regions of stable and unstable orbits. In particular, we classify charged particle dynamics into attractive and repulsive Lorentz force configurations and show that in the attractive case, charged particles can accumulate near the current loop, forming collective currents that oppose the original current loop magnetic field. We demonstrate that charged particle accumulation can lead to the formation of toroidal structures analogous to radiation belts in the BH magnetosphere. We compare the curved spacetime solution to flat spacetime analogs and highlight general relativistic effects such as the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit for charged particles, which sets a lower bound for radiation belt formation. The divergence of the vector potential at the loop location in the idealized infinitesimal loop model is addressed, and we argue that a physically realistic model must consider a finite-width current distribution to avoid unphysical divergences in the effective potential.",
New submissions,"Topological Big Bangs: Reflection, Itty-Bitty Blenders, and Eternal Trumpets","Hubert Bray,James Wheeler",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We discuss and formalize a topological means by which the initial singularity might be mollified, at the level of the spacetime manifold's structure, in classical cosmological models of a homogeneous expanding universe. The construction, dubbed a ""reflective"" topological big bang, generalizes Schrodinger's elliptic de Sitter space and is built to be compatible with the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) picture of the large-scale universe, only minimally modifying it via some nontrivial topology at an earliest ""moment"" in the universe's history. We establish a mathematical characterization of the admissible topological structures of reflective topological big bangs, and we discuss implications for a standard concern in cosmology, the horizon problem. We present a nonreflective example that we've christened the Itty-Bitty Blender spacetime: this spacetime and its universal cover, the Eternal Trumpet spacetime, exhibit interesting potential structures of spacetimes avoiding the Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems.",
New submissions,Physical black holes: spacetime and matter near trapping surfaces,"Swayamsiddha Maharana,Rama Vadapalli",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Within a semiclassical framework, we investigate spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations that (i) develop a trapped region within a finite time as measured by distant observers, and (ii) remain sufficiently regular at the apparent horizon. These requirements characterize the self-consistent approach, and it imposes specific constraints on the limiting form of the energy momentum tensor (EMT). Previous works argued that only certain EMT classes admit viable dynamical solutions, while discarding others (see, e.g., Terno 2020) based on reasoning that is not entirely robust. Here, we explicitly demonstrate that the discarded classes are indeed unphysical. In addition, we also introduce a new class of static solutions that are regular at the horizon and allow finite-time horizon crossing according to a distant observer.",
New submissions,A study of the pulsar EXO 1745-248 in $f(Q)$ gravity with pseudo-spheroidal geometry,"Bibhash Das,Bikash Chandra Paul",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"We present a singularity-free relativistic interior solution for constructing stable quark stellar models in the framework of a linear $f(Q)$ gravity ($f(Q) = \alpha Q + \phi$) satisfying the pseudo-spheroidal geometry. The physical features and the stability of the stellar model is explored with strange star (SS) candidate EXO 1745-248 ($M = 1.7\, M_{\odot}$ and $R = 9\, km$). The Durgapal-Banerjee transformation is employed to obtain the relativistic interior solution using the MIT Bag model equation of state (EoS): $P = \frac{1}{3}(\rho - 4 B_{g})$. For a linear form of $f(Q)$ gravity, we obtain the exterior vacuum solution, which reduces to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) solution with the cosmological constant term, $\Lambda = \frac{\phi}{2\alpha}$. The stellar model is analyzed for the different values of the spheroidicity parameter ($\mu$). The value of $\alpha$ is constrained using a viable physical limit on the Bag parameter ($B_{g} \in [57.55,95.11]\,MeV\,fm^{-3}$). The constraints on Mass-Radius relation indicates that physically acceptable SS models are permitted for $\mu \geq 7$. The contribution of $\mu$ to the energy density, pressure profiles, and other physical features is studied for the SS candidate EXO 1745-248. The stability of the stellar model obtained here is also analyzed through causality condition, adiabatic index and other stability criteria. We also investigate the stellar model for other SS candidates to test its viability. The relativistic interior solution obtained here can be used to construct viable and physically acceptable strange star models with very high compactness ratio in the framework of linear $f(Q)$ gravity.",
New submissions,DBI scalar field cosmology in $n$-DBI gravity,"Nahomi Kan,Kiyoshi Shiraishi,Maki Takeuchi,Mai Yashiki",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study inflationary characterictics of the universe in $n$-DBI gravity, driven by DBI-deformed scalar fields. In this paper, we consider the evolution of the classical universe for a scalar potential whose equations of motion are expressed by a BPS-like system of first-order differentialthis http URLadvantage of a BPS-like system is that it allows the initial condition for the wave function of the Universe in minisuperspace quantum cosmology to be automatically determined by the Hamiltonian constraint. By appropriately choosing the prepotential underlying the potential, we can construct single-scalar-field models that have the phases of exponential and power-law expansions. We show that the slow-roll parameters for our models can be expressed in terms of the prepotential with simple settings.",
New submissions,Can LIGO Detect Daylight Savings Time?,Reed Essick,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Yes, it can.Catalogs produced by networks of Gravitational-wave interferometers are subject to complicated selection effects, and the gold-standard remains direct measurements of the detection probability through large injection campaigns. I leverage public data products from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' 3rd and 4th observing runs to show that there are non-trivial temporal variations within the detection probability that are well-described by a weekly cycle. There are clear differences between weekends and weekdays, between day and night (at the sites), and even between daylight-savings and standard time. I discuss possible causes for this behavior and implications.",
New submissions,Universal relations for fast rotating neutron stars without equation of state bias,"Christian J. KrÃ¼ger,Mariachiara Celato",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We provide a summary of several parametrisations for the nuclear equation of state that have been proposed over the past decades and list viable ranges for their parameters. Based on these parametrisations, we construct a large database of rotating neutron star models, which are arranged in sequences of constant central energy density. After filtering these sequences with respect to generous astrophysical constraints, we discover tight universal relations for various bulk quantities of uniformly rotating neutron stars of arbitrary rotation rates. These universal relations allow to estimate, at very low computational cost, bulk quantities of rotating neutron stars employing mass, radius, and moment of inertia of associated non-rotating neutron stars. The relations are calibrated to a large, model-agnostic dataset, thereby eliminating a potential bias, and prove to be robust. Such relations are important for future, high-precision measurements coming from electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations and may be used in equation of state inference codes or gravitational wave modeling among others.",
New submissions,Black Hole Gravitational Phenomena in Higher-Order Curvature-Scalar Gravity,"A. A. AraÃºjo Filho,N. Heidari,Iarley P. Lobo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This work aims to explore the gravitational consequences of a recently proposed black hole solution presented in the literature [Phys. Dark Univ. 50 (2025) 102061]. We initiate our analyzes by taking into account the horizon structure, focusing on both the event and Cauchy horizons. Subsequently, we examine the quasinormal modes by considering all types of perturbations -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial. To strengthen these results, we also compute the time-domain for each perturbation. Next, we turn to the study of optical properties of the black hole. In particular, we investigate null geodesics, the photon sphere and its stability, as well as the corresponding black hole shadows. Following this, we analyze gravitational lensing phenomena in two regimes: the weak-field limit, utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and the strong deflection limit, employing Tsukamoto's approach. In addition, we confront the lensing observables with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, constraints on the parameter $\xi$ -- which is introduced by higher-order curvature-scalar gravity, thereby differing from the Schwarzschild solution -- are estimated using Solar System measurements such as the precession of Mercury's orbit, gravitational light bending, and time delay (or Shapiro effect).",
New submissions,Quasinormal modes and tidal Love numbers of covariant effective quantum black holes with cosmological constant,"Yunlong Liu,Xiangdong Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper systematically investigates the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and tidal Love numbers of covariant quantum-modified black holes (BHs) within two cosmological constant-dependent metric frameworks. By deriving axial/polar perturbation equations and employing pseudospectral methods (for QNMs) and numerical integration (for Love numbers), we quantify the quantum parameter $\zeta$'s influence. We find that, higher overtones exhibit enhanced $\zeta$ sensitivity. Solution 1 maintains purely imaginary QNMs under $\zeta$ variation, whereas Solution 2 demonstrates mode transitions from real to complex for polar/axial perturbations. Furthermore, for Love number, axial perturbations show non-monotonic $\zeta$ dependence, with $\Delta\mathcal{T}^a_l$ peaking at specific $\ell$ values before decay. While for polar perturbation of the same metric displays strictly monotonic $\zeta$ effects on $\Delta\mathcal{T}^p_l$. These results highlight quantum gravity's role in BH perturbation dynamics and cosmological BH phenomenology.",
New submissions,Jiggled interferometer: Ground-based gravitational wave detector using rapidly-repeated free-falling test masses,"Shoki Iwaguchi,Bin Wu,Kurumi Umemura,Tomohiro Ishikawa,Kenji Tsuji,Ryota Nishimura,Yuta Michimura,Yutaro Enomoto,Soichiro Morisaki,Yoichi Aso,Tomotada Akutsu,Keiko Kokeyama,Seiji Kawamura",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose the Jiggled Interferometer (JIGI), a novel ground-based gravitational wave detector with space-like sensitivity. Using rapidly-repeated free-fall test masses, JIGI eliminates seismic and suspension thermal noise during free fall. Compared to the Juggled Interferometer, it offers improved angular stability and avoids tracking lasers. We analyze detrending--a required step to remove actuation-induced noise--and show sensitivity gains of about four orders of magnitude in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band, relative to seismic and suspension noise extrapolated from the Cosmic Explorer.",
Cross submissions,Higher-derivative Heterotic Kerr-Sen Black Holes,"Peng-Ju Hu,Liang Ma,Yi Pang,Robert J. Saskowski",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.",
Cross submissions,A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone,"Guglielmo Grimaldi,Matthew Headrick,Veronika E. Hubeny",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.",
Cross submissions,CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in Synthetic Data,Jericho Cain,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary ""blind search"" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.",
Cross submissions,Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation,"Nahuel MirÃ³n-Granese,Claudia G. ScÃ³ccola",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.",

In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.",
Cross submissions,Physics-informed neural network solves minimal surfaces in curved spacetime,"Koji Hashimoto,Koichi Kyo,Masaki Murata,Gakuto Ogiwara,Norihiro Tanahashi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a flexible framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving boundary value problems involving minimal surfaces in curved spacetimes, with a particular emphasis on singularities and moving boundaries. By encoding the underlying physical laws into the loss function and designing network architectures that incorporate the singular behavior and dynamic boundaries, our approach enables robust and accurate solutions to both ordinary and partial differential equations with complex boundary conditions. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through applications to minimal surface problems in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, including examples relevant to the AdS/CFT correspondence (e.g. Wilson loops and gluon scattering amplitudes) popularly used in the context of string theory in theoretical physics. Our methods efficiently handle singularities at boundaries, and also support both ""soft"" (loss-based) and ""hard"" (formulation-based) imposition of boundary conditions, including cases where the position of a boundary is promoted to a trainable parameter. The techniques developed here are not limited to high-energy theoretical physics but are broadly applicable to boundary value problems encountered in mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences, wherever singularities and moving boundaries play a critical role.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Entropy,"Sangmin Choi,Malcolm J. Perry",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We formulate the classical gravitational entropy of a horizon as a Noether charge that does not require the notion of a temperature, and which is applicable to horizons that are not necessarily associated with black holes. This introduces a correction to the covariant phase space formalism that accounts for the configuration-dependence of the generating vector field conjugate to the charge. The vector field is related to the proposal of Bousso that the gravitational entropy of a region is determined by the lightsheet at its boundary. We test the formula on various black hole and cosmological horizons.",

We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.",
Cross submissions,Inflationary trispectrum of gauge fields from scalar and tensor exchanges,"P. Jishnu Sai,S. R. Haridev,Rajeev Kumar Jain",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we compute the inflationary trispectrum of primordial gauge fields generated through the scalar and tensor exchanges in models with spectator $U(1)$ gauge fields which are kinetically coupled to the inflaton. Focusing on the connected four-point autocorrelation function of gauge fields, we derive exact analytical expressions for the full trispectrum of both electric and magnetic fields using the in-in formalism and cosmological diagrammatic rules, and explore their respective contributions in specific momentum configurations. For the scalar exchange, we find that the trispectrum signal in the equisided configuration grows with the exchange momentum and reaches its maximum in the flattened limit. However, in the counter collinear limit, we show that the non-linearity parameter associated with the trispectrum scales quadratically with the corresponding parameter of the cross-correlation bispectrum of magnetic fields and curvature perturbations, thereby establishing a hierarchical relation between the higher- and lower-order correlation functions. For the tensor exchange, the trispectrum displays a richer angular dependence, reflecting the sensitivity to the orientation of the momentum quadrilateral with respect to the tensor polarisation, producing characteristic angular modulations in the trispectrum. Detecting such angular signatures in future high-precision cosmological observations would provide a novel window into tensor-mediated interactions in the early universe.",
Cross submissions,Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions,"Yuxuan Shi,Hongbo Cheng",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The appearance of a black hole shadow, in both astronomical observations and theoretical analysis, depends critically on the properties of the surrounding accretion. In this study, we analyse the emission and observational properties of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo by considering three simplified accretion models, which have not been previously explored in such detail. Based on our findings, direct emission contributes markedly to the whole observed intensity for a Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole encircled by a geometrically thin accretion disk. The corresponding regions and measured intensities of the lensing ring, the photon ring, and direct emission are sensitive to the parameters of the Hernquist DM halo. Apart from disk accretion, we also study two spherical accretion models: static and infalling. With increasing Hernquist DM parameters, both models exhibit a significant decrease in the measured intensity, yet the photon spheres are enlarged by an increase of $\sim2\%$ to $\sim30\%$. Furthermore, Doppler de-boosting due to the infalling accretion results in darker shadow images compared to static cases. By precising visualisations of the shadows, our results suggest that the observational characteristics of black hole shadows can serve as a powerful probe for distinguishing between different DM distributions around supermassive black holes.",
Cross submissions,Existence of uniform Temple charts and applications to null distance,"Benjamin Meco,Anna Sakovich,Christina Sormani",Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we prove that Temple's cylindrical future null coordinate charts can be constructed uniformly and we estimate the gradients of their optical functions. We then apply these charts to study a spacetime $(N,g)$ that has been converted into a definite metric space $(N,\hat{d}_\tau)$, where $\hat{d}_\tau$ is the null distance of Sormani and Vega defined using a locally anti-Lipschitz (in the sense of Chrusciel, Grant, and Minguzzi) generalized time function $\tau$. In particular, in the case when $\tau$ is Lipschitz we prove that $(N, \hat{d}_\tau)$ is a rectifiable metric space, where the causal structure is locally encoded by $\tau$ and $\hat{d}_\tau$. As a consequence, applying a classical theorem of Hawking and following a technique developed by Sakovich and Sormani, we can prove a Lorentzian isometry theorem, generalizing our earlier result.",

Sarraga,Mirian Tsulaia",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.",
Cross submissions,"Dual is Different: EFTs, Axions and Nonpropagating Form Fields in Cosmology","C.P. Burgess,F. Quevedo",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Scalar fields in 4D are known to have equivalent dual descriptions in terms of form-field gauge potentials, but this is often regarded as an arcane fact. Why use more complicated formulations when simpler scalar descriptions exist and are equivalent? We describe three ways in which scalars that arise as duals can differ from their garden-variety counterparts. Two of these -- the interchange of weak and strong couplings and utility in bringing topological information to the low-energy theory -- are relatively well-known, but to these we add a third: dualities that map derivative interactions to non-derivative interactions seem not to commute with the general power-counting arguments that quantify control over the low-energy approximation within any EFT involving gravity. Since both sides of the duality must agree on their low-energy limit, the non-derivative interactions on the scalar side of the duality turn out to be suppressed relative to what would generically be assumed. They are nonetheless technically natural, as is particularly clear in the dual formulation. We argue that scalar fields arising as duals (such as the universal axion $a$ from string vacua) that have the commonly assumed $J^\mu \partial_\mu a$ interaction with matter also have $J^\mu J_\mu$ contact interactions among the respective currents, some of whose implications we explore. We also emphasize the non-trivial role and cosmological implications of non-propagating 3-form gauge potentials and clarify confusing statements recently made in the literature regarding the validity of duality for massive form fields.",

After analyzing the global and the local stabilities, we examine the criticality and the Joule-Thomson expansion behaviors in such noncommutative backgrounds. Concretely, we find that the critical universal numbers X_N can be expressed as X_0 + NX, where N is the quintessence parameter and X_0 is the critical universal number of the Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m-AdS black holes in a NC spacetime without additional external fields. Furthermore, we find that Van der Waals behaviors can be recovered by strictly constraining the charge in terms of external parameters. To conclude this work, we compute and examine the deflection angle of lights in such a modified spacetime geometry.",

This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to such an AI experiment.",
Cross submissions,Astrophysics: a Modern Discipline with a Newtonian origin,M. Paola Vaccaro,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph),"Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.",
Cross submissions,Testing $n_s=1$ in light of the latest ACT and SPT data,"Ze-Yu Peng,Jun-Qian Jiang,Hao Wang,Yun-Song Piao",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It is commonly recognized that the primordial scalar spectral index $n_s$ is approximately $0.96-0.975$, depending on the dataset. However, this view is being completely altered by the early dark energy (EDE) resolutions of the Hubble tension, known as the most prominent tension the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is suffering from. In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE, resolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be accompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the cosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\simeq {\cal O}(0.001))$. In this work, we strengthen and reconfirm this result with the latest ground-based CMB data from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work again highlights the importance of re-examining our understanding on the very early Universe within the broader context of cosmological tensions.",
Cross submissions,Cosmological FLRW phase transitions under exponential corrected entropy,"Rodrigo Rivadeneira-Caro,Joel F. Saavedra,Francisco Tello-Ortiz",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This work considers how exponential corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula affect the thermodynamic behavior of the FLRW cosmological model. These corrections drastically change the form of the Friedman field equations inducing non-trivial phase transition behavior. For negative values of the trace parameter $\alpha$, the system presents first-order phase transitions above the critical temperature, and for positive $\alpha$, the system undergoes a reentrant phase transition. As these corrections are presumably relevant at the early Universe stage, to corroborate the presence of some potential vestige of this contribution in the current era, a study has been carried out comparing observational data and current values of the Hubble parameter.",

Cross submissions,Quantum Effects for Black Holes with On-Shell Amplitudes,"Katsuki Aoki,Andrea Cristofoli,Hyun Jeong,Matteo Sergola,Kaho Yoshimura",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We develop a framework based on modern amplitude techniques to analyze emission and absorption effects in black hole physics, including Hawking radiation. We first discuss quantum field theory on a Schwarzschild background in the Boulware and Unruh vacua, and introduce the corresponding $S$-matrices. We use this information to determine on-shell absorptive amplitudes describing processes where a black hole transitions to a different mass state by absorbing or emitting quanta, to all orders in gravitational coupling. This on-shell approach allows for a universal description of black holes, with their intrinsic differences encapsulated in the discontinuities of the amplitudes, without suffering from off-shell ambiguities such as gauge freedom. Furthermore, the absorptive amplitudes serve as building blocks to describe physics beyond that of isolated black holes. As applications, we find that the Hawking thermal spectrum is well understood by three-point processes. We also consider a binary system and compute the mass shift of a black hole induced by the motion of a companion object, including quantum effects. We show that the mean value of the mass shift is classical and vacuum-independent, while its variance differs depending on the vacuum choice. Our results provide confirmation of the validity of the on-shell program in advancing our understanding of black hole physics.",
