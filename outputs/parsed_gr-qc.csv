New submissions,Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime in regular coordinates with cosmological time,"Leonardo de Lima,Davi C. Rodrigues",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Starting from the Einstein equations in Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime and imposing Friedmann-Robertson-Walker coordinates at large distances, we find two coordinate systems with time-dependent metrics that are smooth across both the black hole and cosmological horizons. These coordinates require a positive cosmological constant for regularity, and thus they are not de Sitter extensions of the Kruskal-Szekeres or Israel coordinates. One of the coordinate systems was only found in 1999 (Abbassi coordinates), and it has led to conflicting interpretations in the literature, while the other was briefly commented on and promptly dismissed as unphysical or incompatible with SdS. We derive that the second solution is equivalent to the first one, and that both are indeed equivalent descriptions of SdS spacetime. We also derive explicit coordinate transformations linking these coordinate systems to the Kottler coordinates and the maximally extended Lake-Israel coordinates. Among other applications, these results, which extend the largely used cosmological and local coordinates, should be useful for further developments in understanding the exact interplay between black holes and the cosmological background, which has been the focus of a number of recent works.",
New submissions,Spherically symmetric solution in quadratic non-metricity gravity,"G.G.L. Nashed,Kazuharu Bamba",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explicitly find an exact spherically symmetric solution in quadratic non-metricity gravity. We show that the quadratic term acts as a cosmological constant. This solution contradicts all the claims in the literature that there is no spherically symmetric solution for higher-order non-metricity gravity. Moreover, we demonstrate that for the charged field equations, the solution can be identical to the non-charged case. This is because the off-diagonal components of the field equation do not feel the effect of the charge.",
New submissions,Analysis and research on superradiant stability of Kerr-sen Black Hole,Wen-Xiang Chen,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Kerr Sen black holes possess stretchon parameters and hidden conformal symmetries. The superradiant stability and steady state resonance of such black holes warrant further investigation and form the primary motivation for this study. In this work,we introduce an additional variable, referred to as y, to generalize the findings of the previous study. When the frequency of the perturbation lies within a specific range namely, above a certain threshold determined by the spin parameter and below the sum of the azimuthal quantum number times the angular velocity at the horizon and the product of the charge with the electric potential at the horizon,the Kerr Sen black hole exhibits superradiant stability. This behavior is similar to the superradiant characteristics previously observed in KN black holes.",
New submissions,Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder models in loop quantum cosmology with Lorentz term,"Minyan Ou,Xiangdong Zhang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A novel quantum black hole model is derived by incorporating the Lorentzian term within the loop quantum cosmology framework of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS) model. This model features a quantum-corrected metric tensor, representing a deformation of the classical Schwarzschild solution. Investigations into the quasi-normal modes reveal that these quantum-corrected black holes exhibit stability against scalar perturbations. Notably, the exponential decay rate within the Lorentzian qOS model demonstrates a significant reduction compared to both the earlier qOS model devoid of this term and the standard Schwarzschild black hole. The higher overtones of the Lorentzian qOS model also differ significantly from those of the earlier qOS model and the standard Schwarzschild black hole, indicating that the near-horizon geometry is substantially modified. The thermodynamic properties with both positive and negative cosmological constant are considered. For the anti-de Sitter case, our analysis reveals that for small black hole masses, the temperature within this loop quantum gravity framework decreases as the mass diminishes, contrasting with classical black hole behavior. Furthermore, a logarithmic term emerges as the leading-order correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Additionally, LQG corrections induce an extra phase transition in the black hole's heat capacity at smaller radius. While for the de Sitter case, the temperature increases as the mass decreases for small black holes, again differing from classical expectations. Similarly to the anti-de Sitter case, LQG corrections in the de Sitter case also lead to an extra phase transition in the heat capacity at small radius.",
New submissions,Masses dynamics during black hole evaporation in spatially flat FLRW universes,"Ion I. Cotaescu,Ion Cotaescu Jr",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The new dynamical solutions of Einstein's equations with perfect fluid in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour, derived recently \cite{Cot,Cot1,Cot2}, may describe evaporating black holes whose masses dissipate into dust. The time evolution of the black hole and dust masses of simple models of evaporating black holes are studied using analytical and graphical methods.",
New submissions,A General Model for Dark Energy Crossing the Phantom Divide,"Zhibang Yao,Gen Ye,Alessandra Silvestri",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Within the framework of spatially covariant theories, we propose a general model for dark energy (DE) in which the cosmological background and perturbations are independently controlled by different sets of coefficients, and the equation of state of DE is directly determined by two free functions of time from the Lagrangian. These properties allow to realize arbitrary background evolutions while avoiding ghost and gradient instabilities in linear perturbations. They also enable a more direct analysis of phantom crossing without having to first solve the background equations of motion. In this model, the sound speed of the scalar mode is scale-dependent and approaches infinity at large scale, so that the field becomes non-dynamical in the infrared (IR) limit. Even though this usually indicates a strong coupling issue, we speculate that this is avoided because the scalar degree of freedom becomes frozen not only at linear order but also at any higher order in IR limit. Given this characteristic large scales behavior, we dub the model \emph{Freezing Gravity}. On smaller scales, the scalar mode propagates with a finite speed of sound. The theory has a cut-off in energy, signaled by the pole in the speed of sound, when the effective Planck mass exceeds Planck mass.",
New submissions,Gravitational Waves from Simulated Mergers of 2 and 3 Black Holes,Faisal Alotaibi,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this project, we simulate the collision of two and three black holes using NRPy+ (`Python-based code generation for numerical relativity and beyond') module and BSSN (Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura) formulation, and extract the resulting gravitational waveforms. Using Brill-Lindquist initial data and sixth-order finite differences, we evolve the system using the BSSN formulation and compute the gravitational-wave signal via the Weyl scalar $\psi_4$. To assess numerical error, we plot the Hamiltonian constraint and observe that constraint violations are significantly higher in the three-black-hole collision. Unexpected gravitational recoil is also detected, which may influence waveform extraction and that is left for further investigation. Despite the limitations in computational resources imposed by the Google Colab, we successfully model the merger of a binary black hole system, and we were able to extract the corresponding gravitational waves.",
New submissions,Aharonov-Bohm Effects for Electromagnetism and Gravity in Four-Dimensional Spacetime,"Yanhui Li,Yakefu Reyimuaji",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper investigates a geometric framework for the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect in four-dimensional spacetime, demonstrating how spacetime curvature induces nonlocal quantum phase shifts within field-free regions. By constructing vector bundles on spacetime manifolds equipped with Levi-Civita connections, we derive the holonomy transformations for parallel-transported quantum states. Under the Newtonian approximation, metric decomposition into Minkowski background plus scalar potential perturbations reveals through the linearized Einstein field equations that the gravitationally induced phase shift is mathematically isomorphic to its electromagnetic counterpart. These results establish the quantum observability of gravitational gauge structures and provide theoretical support for experimental verification via atom interferometry.",
New submissions,Statistical Entropy Based on the Generalized-Uncertainty-Principle-Induced Effective Metric,"Soon-Tae Hong,Yong-Wan Kim,Young-Jai Park",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the statistical entropy of black holes within the framework of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) by employing effective metrics that incorporate leading-order and all-orders quantum gravitational corrections. We construct three distinct effective metrics induced by the GUP, which are derived from GUP-corrected temperature, entropy, and all-orders GUP corrections, and analyze their impact on black hole entropy using 't Hooft's brick wall method. Our results show that, despite the differences in the effective metrics and the corresponding ultraviolet cutoffs, the statistical entropy consistently satisfies the Bekenstein-Hawking area law when expressed in terms of an invariant (coordinate-independent) distance near the horizon. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the GUP naturally regularizes the ultraviolet divergence in the density of states, eliminating the need for artificial cutoffs and yielding finite entropy even when counting quantum states only in the vicinity of the event horizon. These findings highlight the universality and robustness of the area law under GUP modifications and provide new insights into the interplay between quantum gravity effects and black hole thermodynamics.",
New submissions,Wave Function Collapse Triggering Spacetime Dynamics in Semiclassical Gravity,Xiaoqiang Wang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a novel semiclassical mechanism to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity, where wave function collapse in a superposition state induces a rapid change in the energy-momentum tensor, triggering spacetime dynamics that propagate at the speed of light. Unlike models assuming superposed spacetimes, we posit that the superposition yields a single, continuous classical spacetime driven by the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor. Upon collapse, the abrupt shift modifies the spacetime metric via Einstein's field equations, respecting causality. We explore this for a particle in a spatial superposition, propose detailed experimental designs with numerical simulations of gravitational perturbations, address potential theoretical challenges, and discuss implications for existing quantum-gravity theories. This framework offers a pathway to reconcile quantum and gravitational dynamics without quantizing spacetime, with testable signatures in future experiments.",
New submissions,Geometric multipartite entanglement from gravitational particle production,"Alessio Belfiglio,Roberto Franzosi,Orlando Luongo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We explore novel generation of genuine multipartite entanglement within gravitational particle production processes during inflationary stages. To this end, we focus on perturbative production mechanisms, considering a non-minimally coupled scalar inflaton field with quartic self-coupling potential and computing probability amplitudes arising from its gravitational interaction with background perturbations. The corresponding entanglement amount is quantified using the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, that provides a \emph{geometric interpretation of particle entanglement, in terms of the Fubini-Study metric}. We observe that, in the limit of negligible squeezing, the total amount of entanglement is dominated by the infrared cutoff scale, in agreement with previous studies analyzing the von Neumann entropy within bipartite scenarios. We then show that \emph{non-negligible multipartite entanglement signatures may emerge across inflation, even during the latest stages of slow-roll}, highlighting their dependence on inflationary momentum scales. Generalizations to regimes with non-negligible squeezing, cubic non-Gaussianities, additional spectator fields and possible observational signatures are also discussed.",
New submissions,Revisiting the Penrose Process in Rotating Black Holes with Quantum Corrections: Implications for Energy Extraction and Irreducible Mass,"Urooj Fatima,G. Abbas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore the extraction of energy from a rotating black hole spacetime modified by a quantum correction parameter \( \alpha \). Focusing on particle splitting within the ergoregion, we analyze the Penrose process and compute the extraction efficiency \( \eta \) as a function of both the spin parameter \( a \) and the quantum correction parameter \( \alpha \). Our results show that increasing \( \alpha \) induces an inward shift of the event horizon and the static limit, resulting in a modest expansion of the ergoregion. This geometric change significantly enhances the energy extraction potential. By numerically solving the horizon equation, we determine a maximum extraction efficiency of 11.64\%. Additionally, we derive the expression for the irreducible mass, highlighting its fundamental role in constraining the amount of extractable rotational energy. Overall, our findings demonstrate that quantum corrections have a substantial impact on black hole energetics, leading to marked deviations from predictions based on classical Kerr theory.",
New submissions,Equatorial stability analysis of dust particle orbits within a charged rotating disc of dust,David Rumler,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Stability of circular orbits of the dust particles within a charged rotating disc of dust with respect to perturbations in the equatorial plane is analyzed. Within Einstein-Maxwell theory, the charged rotating disc of dust is an axisymmetric, stationary solution given in terms of a post-Newtonian expansion. The disc solution is characterized by a rigid rotation around the axis of symmetry and a constant specific charge $\epsilon$. It is found that for $\epsilon<1$ all realized dust particle orbits are stable and for $\epsilon=1$ all dust particles are in marginally stable states.",
New submissions,"Quintom-like transit universe models in Metric-affine Myrzakulov $f(R,T,Q,T_m)$ gravity","Dinesh Chandra Maurya,Harjit Kumar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The current transit universe model is a precise solution to the equations of a new type of gravity theory called metric-affine Myrzakulov $f(R,T,Q,T_m)$ [Herko et al. Phys. Dark Univ. 34 (2021) 100886]. We find a hyperbolic solution and determine the limits on the model's parameters using the latest observational data. We examine how certain cosmological factors, like the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, effective equation of state parameter $\omega_{eff}$, dark energy equation of state parameter $\omega_{de}$, and matter energy density parameter $\Omega$, change over time to help explain the properties of the observable universe. We establish a hyperbolic solution and obtain the observational constraints on the model parameters using the latest observational datasets. We study the evolution of several cosmological parameters, including the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, effective equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{eff}$, dark energy EoS parameter $\omega_{de}$, to explain the properties of the observable universe. We perform the Om diagnostic test for the model, and it represents the phantom scenarios of the model. The behavior of the dark energy EoS parameter $\omega_{de}$ reveals the quintom-A-type universe characteristics.",
New submissions,Charged Taub-NUT type Black Holes in Einstein-Weyl-Maxwell Theory,"Ze Li,Hai-Shan Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We numerically construct new charged Taub-NUT-type black hole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Weyl-Maxwell theory. We explore the effects of the NUT parameter and the electric charge parameter on the black hole solutions in great detail. Compared with static spherical black holes in the same theory, there is one major difference: there are three branches of NUT solutions, whereas there are only two branches of static spherical black hole solutions. Compared with neutral NUT solutions in Weyl gravity, where the solutions intersect with each other, the charged NUT solutions we find are disconnected.",
New submissions,Time as a Cosmological Phenomenon,Andrea Palessandro,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph),"We show that the arrow of time is intimately related to the geometry and topology of the whole universe, and is therefore best understood as a cosmological phenomenon.",
New submissions,The space-time structure of an untouchable naked singularity,"Leonel Bixano,Tonatiuh Matos",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"According to the Cosmic Censorship conjecture, naked singularities are thought to be forbidden in nature and must remain hidden by a horizon. In this work, we present the causal structure of an exact solution to the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations representing a wormhole (WH), where the ring singularity, without even horizon, is untouchable, this is, causally disconnected from the rest of the universe. We analyze its metric functions in Papapetrou coordinates to verify metric analyticity in spacetime, construct the Carter-Penrose diagram, and use Boyer-Linquist coordinates to visualize the lining of the ring singularity by the throat. We conclude that the ring singularity in this WH is lined by the throat, similar to how the event horizon lines the ring singularity in the Kerr-Newman black hole, satisfying the Wormhole Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. In this work we show that the topology of the WH is such that the two sides of the throat are separated by the singularity, but are topologically identified, giving rise to an instantaneous connection between these two regions.",
New submissions,Generalized Vaidya Spacetime in Cotton and Conformal Killing Theories,"Metin Gürses,Yaghoub Heydarzade,Çetin Şentürk",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We demonstrate that the non-vacuum field equations of Cotton gravity and Conformal Killing gravity admit a generalized class of Vaidya-type solutions. In particular, beyond the standard induced term associated with the matter source, the generalized metric incorporates two additional correction terms of purely geometric origin, arising from the unique structure of these theories. This extended solution generalizes the classical Vaidya spacetime in General Relativity and offers new insights into the dynamics of radiating spacetimes within the framework of these third-rank gravity theories.",
New submissions,Black Hole Chemistry: the first 15 years,Robert B. Mann,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The introduction of thermodynamics into gravitational physics began 5 decades ago with the discovery that black holes behave like thermodynamic systems once semiclassical quantum effects are taken into account. Notions of temperature, entropy, work, and phase changes that were introduced into gravitational physics and originally applied to black holes, were later extended to cosmological horizons and other settings as well. A major development occurred 15 years ago with the introduction of pressure in the form of a cosmological constant. By extending the thermodynamic phase space to include this term, along with its conjugate volume, black holes were found to exhibit a broad variety of phase transitions that resembled phenomena seen in chemistry labs. Black hole thermodynamics has become Black Hole Chemistry, which has led to a wealth of insights into the nature of black holes, introducing concepts such as Van der Waals fluids, reentrant phase transitions, and triple points into gravitational physics. I discuss the origins of Black Hole Chemistry and its basic features covered in an earlier review [1], and then go on to describe developments in the subject that have taken place since then. Examples include multicritical behaviour, polymeric transitions, superfluid transitions, scalar hair, heat engines, NUT-charge, acceleration thermodynamics, the Joule-Thompson expansion, holography, complexity, central charge criticality, microstructure, thermodynamic tension, phase dynamics, and thermodynamic topology. This wealth of new phenomena suggest that we likely still have a lot to learn from Black Hole Chemistry.",
New submissions,Averaging Dynamics of Scalar Field-Matter Interacting Models in Anisotropic Universes: The Locally Rotationally Symmetric Bianchi I Spacetime,"Alfredo D. Millano,Genly Leon,Andronikos Paliathanasis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We consider an anisotropic cosmological model based on the locally rotational Bianchi I spacetime, incorporating a scalar field and a non-zero cosmological interaction term. The framework of averaging theory is employed to study the associated non-linear differential equations. Through a qualitative analysis of the gravitational field equations, we obtain valuable insights into the structure of the solution space for the anisotropic scalar field model with a generalized harmonic potential. The interaction between the scalar field and matter is described by a general expression that depends on the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of the scalar field, and the energy densities of cold dark matter and dark energy. This formulation involves real parameters that modulate the interaction, as well as a coupling constant with the dimensions of the Hubble parameter. We show that the Hubble parameter serves as a time-dependent perturbation parameter, controlling the discrepancy between the full system and its time-averaged counterpart. As this parameter decreases, both systems converge to the same asymptotic behaviour. This enables the suppression of oscillatory effects, significantly simplifying the dynamical analysis. Finally, we identify conditions on the interaction parameters that ensure the regularity of the system's evolution by preventing the emergence of singularities.",
New submissions,Formation of Frozen Stars from collapsing matter by tunneling,"Ram Brustein,A.J.M. Medved,Tamar Simhon",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The frozen star is a type of black hole mimicker: An ultracompact object whose exterior geometry resembles that of a general-relativistic black hole but differs in its matter composition and in the regularity of its interior geometry. It is sourced by a spherically symmetric collection of open-string flux tubes, which posses an extremely anisotropic energy-momentum-stress tensor with maximally negative radial pressure. The frozen star represents an effective classical description of the highly quantum, closed-string polymer model. A key challenge for any model of a black hole mimicker is to explain how such objects can form from a collapsing body of matter. We started to address this important problem in a previous article by adapting the Euclidean-action method of Gibbons and Hawking to show that the transition into a frozen star is likely. Here, we improve on our previous results by showing that the transition probability for a collapsing shell of matter to tunnel quantum mechanically into a frozen star is unity, up to negligible corrections. Our conclusion is that such a transition is therefore inevitable.",
New submissions,"Spherically Symmetric, Static Solutions in Presence of Matter-Curvature Coupling","Debanjan Debnath,Kaushik Bhattacharya",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work we have proposed some spherically symmetric, static spacetimes in a theory of gravity which permits non-minimal coupling (NMC) between curvature of spacetime and fluid variables. It is shown that these non-minimally coupled theories may admit of new class of metric solutions. Known metric solutions from GR can also be solutions of the non-minimally coupled theories, for these cases the NMC affects the nature of the fluid which sources the spacetime. The paper presents multiple ways in which the modified field equations appearing in non-minimally coupled theories can be solved. The NMC produces multiple definitions of the stress-energy tensor. The paper discusses the complexity related to these sources of curvature as, unlike in minimally coupled general relativity, in the present theory the Ricci curvature itself can affect the stress-energy tensor of the effective fluid which seeds spacetime curvature. The various energy conditions related to various forms of possible stress-energy tensors are presented in the paper.",
New submissions,"Observational Constraints on f(R,T) gravity coupled with NED from Black Hole Quasi Periodic Oscillations","Bidyut Hazarika,Abhishek Baruah,Prabwal Phukon",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we examine the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) and $f(R,T)$ gravity on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) around a magnetically charged black hole. By analyzing the effective potential, specific energy, and angular momentum of circular orbits, we study how the NED parameter $\alpha$ and the gravitational coupling parameter $\beta$ affect orbital dynamics. Increasing $\alpha$ leads to systematic deviations from the Reissner Nordstrom behavior, reflected in shifts in the ISCO radius and orbital frequencies. We further explore QPO-generating radii using the Relativistic Precession (RP), Warped Disk (WD), and Epicyclic Resonance (ER2-ER4) models. We further extend our analysis by performing an MCMC-based parameter estimation using QPO data from black holes spanning a wide range of mass scales. This approach yields consistent observational constraints on the model parameters.",
New submissions,Spin precession in general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes,"Shaofei Xu,Junji Jia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper investigates the spin precession of test particles moving in the equatorial plane of general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes using the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations. The spin precession angles for two cases, the small-spin case and the spin-orbital plane parallel case, are derived using different approximations. For the small-spin case, the precession angle of the spin components in the equatorial plane along circular orbits is found, and perpendicular component is shown to be a constant of motion. For the spin-orbital plane parallel case, it is shown that in general the orbital and spin motions generally do not affect each other, and the spin precession angle is calculated using the post-Newtonian method to an arbitrarily high order of the orbital semi-latus rectum p. The precession angles in both cases are analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively in the Kerr-Newman spacetime to elucidate their features. For large orbital radii, it is shown that the leading order of the precession angle series is generally proportional to the spacetime mass while the Lense-Thirring effect always appears from the subleading order. These precession results are then applied to various astronomical systems to determine their spin precession rates. For systems with observational data, our results show excellent agreement. For systems without observational data, we predict their spin precession rates at both the leading and Lense-Thirring effect orders. These predictions indicate that Jupiter's satellites exhibit exceptionally large geodetic spin precession and their Lense-Thirring effect may be detectable with current technology.",
New submissions,Observables are glocal,"Emil Broukal,Andrea Di Biagio,Eugenio Bianchi,Marios Christodoulou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We study how the problem of observables is fully resolved for background independent theories defined on finite graphs. We argue the correct analogue of coordinate independence is the invariance under changes of graph labels, a kind of permutation invariance. Invariants are formed by a group average that probes the entire graph -- they are global. Strikingly, sets of complete observables can be constructed so that each seeks a connected subgraph structure -- local correlations. Geometrical information is fully encoded in background independent observables through this subtle interplay of global and local graph notions, a behavior we term glocal. This provides physically meaningful complete sets of observables for discrete general relativity, suggests a reformulation of the spin networks state space of loop quantum gravity, and reveals deep connections between the problem of observables and the graph isomorphism problem.",
New submissions,Exploring black holes with multiple photon spheres by interferometric signatures,"Xi-Jing Wang,Yuan Meng,Xiao-Mei Kuang,Kai Liao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we investigate the interferometric signatures of hairy Schwarzschild black holes (hSBHs) that have either single or double photon spheres. Our interest mainly stems from two considerations: (i) the photon ring structure in black hole images produces strong and universal interferometric signatures on long baselines, enabling precision measurements of black hole parameters and testing gravitational theory; (ii) the hSBH describes the deformation of standard Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) induced by additional sources, and they can feature double photon spheres within certain parameter regimes. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that for a hSBH with a single photon sphere, the complex visibility amplitude of the image exhibits damped oscillations. A similar behavior appears in the double photon sphere case when the inner photon sphere has lower effective potential than the outer one, as the photons near the inner photon sphere remain trapped by gravity. However, when the inner potential is higher, a beat pattern rises. Our findings reveal that the complex visibility amplitude can encode the signature of the photon sphere structure of the central black hole.",
New submissions,Dynamical analysis of cosmological models in non-minimal scalar non-metricity gravity,"Bikash Chandra Roy,Bikash Chandra Paul",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the evolution of a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe in the framework of scalar non-metricity theory of gravity. In the model, we consider dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) described by the scalar field. In the paper, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the evolution of the observed universe. We probe the universe with and without an interaction between DM and the effective energy density including scalar field in the non-metricity theory that describes the DE. The critical points of the autonomous system and their stability are determined to understand the behaviour of the universe. The cosmological models accommodate the late accelerating phase of the universe for a given set of parameters, a matter-dominated saddle point is also found to exist which is flowed by a decelerating phase dominated by stiff fluid like DE. We obtain a new class of cosmological model accommodating early inflation, matter-dominated era, and a future decelerating phase followed by late acceleration of the universe.",
New submissions,"Traversable Wormholes in non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills Gravity: Geometry, Energy Conditions, and Gravitational Lensing","Jureeporn Yuennan,Allah Ditta,Thammarong Eadkhong,Phongpichit Channuie",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study presents a new class of static, spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) gravity, where the Yang-Mills field is purely magnetic and governed by the SU(2) gauge symmetry. By incorporating a non-zero redshift function and a direct coupling between the Ricci scalar and the Yang-Mills field strength tensor, the work examines the influence of the non-minimal coupling constant $\xi$ and the magnetic charge $Q$ on the wormhole geometry. The analysis demonstrates that suitable choices of these parameters can satisfy the flare-out and throat conditions, allowing for physically viable traversable wormholes without requiring exotic matter. The study further evaluates the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass, showing that quantum corrections, which are modeled through Euler-Heisenberg-type contributions, reduce the total gravitational mass and may stabilize the structure. The energy conditions are analyzed, revealing localized violations of the null and weak energy conditions at the wormhole throat, while the strong energy condition remains satisfied. Additionally, light deflection in the presence of the wormhole is calculated, indicating positive deflection angles and confirming the overall attractive nature of the gravitational field. These findings highlight the role of non-minimal gauge-gravity couplings in constructing observationally distinguishable wormhole configurations.",
New submissions,Spatially covariant gravity with two degrees of freedom in the presence of an auxiliary scalar field: Hamiltonian analysis,"Jun-Cheng Zhu,Shu-Yu Li,Xian Gao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A class of gravity theories respecting spatial covariance and in the presence of non-dynamical auxiliary scalar fields with only spatial derivatives is investigated. Generally, without higher temporal derivatives in the metric sector, there are 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) propagating due to the breaking of general covariance. Through a Hamiltonian constraint analysis, we examine the conditions to eliminate the scalar DOF such that only 2 DOFs, which correspond the tensorial gravitational waves in a homogeneous and isotropic background, are propagating. We find that two conditions are needed, each of which can eliminate half degree of freedom. The second condition can be further classified into two cases according to its effect on the Dirac matrix. We also apply the formal conditions to a polynomial-type Lagrangian as a concrete example, in which all the monomials are spatially covariant scalars containing two derivatives. Our results are consistent with the previous analysis based on the perturbative method.",
New submissions,Constraints on cosmological parameters and CMB first acoustic peak in conformal Killing gravity,"Salvatore Capozziello,Carlo Alberto Mantica,Luca Guido Molinari,Giuseppe Sarracino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the frame of conformal Killing gravity cosmology, we performed a Bayesian analysis on two different datasets of Baryonic Acoustic oscillations (DESI and SDSS DR16) and on two datasets of SNeIa (Pantheon+ and Union3). The results for H0 and Omega_M in a spatially flat FRW background are consistent with the Lambda-CDM scenario. We obtain a non-negligible negative value for the novel density of dark sector, Omega_D, and its relevance in the evolution of the cosmological observables thus finding quantitatively what its contribution is on real data to match the standard scenario. The results confirm the dynamical character of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter q0 and the present time dark energy equation of state parameter w0: the latter belongs to the quintessence regime. The evaluation of the first acoustic peak of CMB places it extraordinarily near to the best value provided by the Planck collaboration. In this scenario, we can conclude that late time and early time data can be successfully matched under the same standard.",
Cross submissions,Reheating after the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking,"Francesco Rescigno,Alberto Salvio",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Theories with radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) lead to first-order phase transitions and the production of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes if the supercooling period lasted long enough. Here we explain how to efficiently reheat the universe after such period in the above-mentioned class of theories. Two cases are possible, depending on whether the RSB scale is much larger than the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale or not. When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.",
Cross submissions,A Note on the AdS/CFT Equivalence Transformation for Galileons in General Dimensions,"Kurt Hinterbichler,Samanta Saha",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The AdS/CFT equivalence transformation is a field redefinition that relates the Weyl dilaton and AdS brane realizations of broken conformal symmetry. Acting on theories with second order equations of motion, it maps the conformal galileons to the DBI galileons for a flat brane probing an AdS bulk. Here we extend this map to arbitrary dimensions and resolve an apparent puzzle regarding the Wess-Zumino terms in odd dimensions.",
Cross submissions,Tunnelling amplitudes and Hawking radiation from worldline QFT,"Anton Ilderton,Karthik Rajeev",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We compare Hawking radiation in a collapse background with Schwinger pair creation in an electric field. The comparison is driven by the presence of an analogue horizon in the Schwinger case, which causally divides spacetime for classical particles, but through which quantum fields can tunnel. Amplitudes for tunnelling processes are encoded in the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the appropriate background-coupled wave equation. We construct these solutions, in both gravity and QED, using the worldline approach, where tunnelling and particle creation manifest as complex saddle points of a real-time path integral. For the Schwinger effect, these saddles correspond to complex worldlines, while for Hawking radiation, the corresponding worldlines are real, but appear complex when extended beyond a certain coordinate patch.",

Bunney,Samin Tajik,Sebastian Erne,Steffen Biermann,Jörg Schmiedmayer,Jorma Louko,William G. Unruh,Silke Weinfurtner",Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a two-tone heterodyne optical readout scheme to extract unequal-time density correlations along an arbitrary stationary interaction path from a pancake-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate, using a modulated laser probe. Analysing the measurement noise both from imprecision and backaction, we identify the standard quantum limit for the signal-extraction scheme, and examine how a class of two-mode squeezed initial states can be used to push beyond this limit. As an application, we show how the readout scheme can be used for an experimental realisation of acceleration-dependence of quantum-vacuum fluctuations in the system, including the analogue spacetime circular motion Unruh effect.",
Cross submissions,Enhanced Gravity-Induced Entanglement via Squeezed Input Light under Finite Measurement Time,"Kosei Hatakeyama,Daisuke Miki,Yamamoto Kazuhiro",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the advantage of using squeezed input light for generating gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) through Fourier-domain analysis. Based on the findings of [1], which demonstrated the feasibility of detecting GIE in optomechanical systems under quantum control, we further demonstrate that squeezed input light can reduce the optical noise in the mechanical conditional state and enhance GIE. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic and statistical errors in the measurement of GIE using the Fourier transformation over a finite measurement time. Based on the error estimations using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in GIE detection, we find that a total measurement time of 10^6 s is required to achieve SNR=1 when using squeezed input light, whereas 10^{6.8} s is needed without squeezed input light. This result highlights the effectiveness of optomechanical systems and the critical role of squeezed input light in enhancing the detectability of GIE.",
Cross submissions,Radiation in Fluid/Gravity and the Flat Limit,"Gabriel Arenas-Henriquez,Luca Ciambelli,Felipe Diaz,Weizhen Jia,David Rivera-Betancour",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes exhibiting radiative behavior, employing null gauges that allow for a well-defined flat limit. The radiative content in the bulk is captured by the super-Poynting vector, which we reinterpret holographically in terms of fluid variables in the dual boundary theory. For algebraically special solutions, we uncover a close connection between bulk radiation and dissipative corrections in the boundary stress tensor, demonstrating a direct link between radiation and entropy production in the boundary fluid. This reveals a rich interplay between radiative dynamics in the bulk and out-of-equilibrium conformal physics at the boundary. We then investigate the flat limit of this correspondence in the context of flat-space holography. In this setting, we construct a Carrollian analogue of the super-Poynting vector and introduce Celestial observables, such as energy detectors, which emerge naturally from the bulk's radiative structure. Our analysis shows that bulk radiation sources the Carrollian viscous stress tensor and heat current, which encodes the Bondi news in this framework. We illustrate our results with explicit examples, including Robinson-Trautman spacetimes and accelerating black holes.",
Cross submissions,Cosmic-Quantum Connections: Assessing the Viability of Weak Gravity and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures in Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier Black Hole,"Saeed Noori Gashti,Behnam Pourhassan",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This paper addresses a potential validation of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) with the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC), as a significant challenge in quantum gravity. We explore the viability of the WGC and WCCC in the context of the Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier (KNKL) black hole. Although these conjectures appear unrelated, but surprising connection between these conjectures, It establishes a bridge between the quantum and the cosmic. By imposing specific constraints on the black hole's parameters, we demonstrate that the WGC and WCCC can be compatible in certain regions. We examine the properties of the KNKL black hole for $q/m > (Q/M )_{ext}$, where $(Q/M )_{ext}$ is the charge-to-mass ratio of a large extremal black hole. We present figures to test the validity of both conjectures simultaneously. Without the spin parameter \(a\), the cloud of string parameter \(b\), quintessence parameter \(\gamma\), and equation of state parameter \(\omega\), the black hole either has two event horizons if \(Q^2/M^2 \leq 1\) or none event horizon if \(Q^2/M^2 > 1\) which leads to a naked singularity that contradicts the WCCC. However, when \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) are present, the black hole has event horizons in some regions in the \(Q^2/M^2 > 1\) that ensure the singularity is covered and both the WGC and WCCC are fulfilled. Actually, we face this issue in the extremality state of the black hole viz these conjectures remain viable, with the black hole maintaining an event horizon. We conclude that certain regions of \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) parameters can make the WGC and WCCC compatible, indicating their agreement when these parameters are present.",
Cross submissions,Extended thermodynamical topology of black hole,"Shan-Ping Wu,Si-Jiang Yang,Shao-Wen Wei",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Thermodynamical topology has emerged as a powerful framework for classifying the thermodynamical behavior of black holes. Three distinct yet complementary topological invariants have been employed to characterize black hole phases, spinodal curves, and critical points in black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we develop a unified framework that integrates these three topological approaches and introduce the concept of extended thermodynamical topology, providing a clear physical interpretation. As a first step, we apply this framework to black holes in Einstein gravity, systematically elucidating their phase structure in terms of topological invariants. We then extend our analysis to black holes in 7-dimensional Lovelock gravity, where novel thermodynamic phenomena naturally emerge from the topological perspective. Moreover, we explore the connection between critical exponents and the extended thermodynamical topology, uncovering a correspondence between the zeros of the $k$-th order vector field and the associated critical exponents. Our study demonstrates that extended thermodynamical topology offers a robust and fine-grained framework for analyzing and classifying black hole phase transitions.",
Cross submissions,The Philosophy and Physics of Duality,"Sebastian De Haro,Jeremy Butterfield",History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This monograph discusses dualities in physics: what dualities are, their main examples--from quantum mechanics and electrodynamics to statistical mechanics, quantum field theory and string theory--and the philosophical questions they raise. Part I first conceptualises dualities and discusses their main roles and themes, including how they are related to familiar notions like symmetry and interpretation. It also discusses the main simple examples of dualities: position-momentum, wave-particle, electric-magnetic, and Kramers-Wannier dualities. Part II discusses advanced examples and their inter-relations: particle-soliton dualities, electric-magnetic dualities in quantum field theories, dualities in string theory, and gauge-gravity duality. This Part ends with discussions of the hole argument, and how string theory counts the microstates of a black hole. Part III is an in-depth discussion of general philosophical issues on which dualities bear: theoretical equivalence (two theories 'saying the same thing, in different words'), scientific realism and the under-determination of theories by data, theory succession and the M-theory programme, explanation, and scientific understanding. It proposes a view of scientific theories that it dubs 'the geometric view of theories'. The book's treatment of the examples is at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level, starting from elementary and progressing to more advanced examples. The discussions of philosophical topics, such as referential semantics, theoretical equivalence, scientific realism and scientific understanding, are both self-contained and in-depth. Thus the book is aimed at students and researchers with an interest in the physical examples and philosophical questions about dualities, and also in how physics and philosophy can fruitfully interact with each other.",
Cross submissions,"Cosmological Constraints on $f(T,B)$ Gravity from Observations of Early and Late Universe","Yahia Al-Omar,Majida Nahili,Nidal Chamoun,Marwan Al-Raeei",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study proposes a unified framework comprising two complementary approaches to constrain three functional forms of $f(T,B)$ gravity, namely the linear, quadratic, and general power law models, by jointly utilizing early and late Universe observations. First, we impose bounds on deviations in the weak interaction freeze-out temperature, informed by the latest measurements of the primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we incorporate direct Hubble parameter data, $H(\mathcal{z})$, obtained from Cosmic Chronometers in the redshift range $0.07\le\mathcal{z}\le2.0$, to trace the expansion history of the Universe. By minimizing a combined chi-square statistic across both datasets, we derive the best-fit values and confidence intervals for each model parameter. The joint analysis significantly refines the parameter constraints compared to methods based solely on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, thereby offering a more robust test of $f(T,B)$ gravity across cosmic epochs. The results support the viability of torsion-based modifications to General Relativity and provide a consistent methodology for future evaluation using upcoming observational data.",

Westbrook",Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"By exciting the transverse breathing mode of an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate, we parametrically produce longitudinal collective excitations in a pairwise manner. This process also referred to as Faraday wave generation, can be seen as an analog to cosmological particle production. Building upon single particle detection, we investigate the early time dynamics of the exponential growth and compare our observation with a Bogoliubov description. The growth rate we observe experimentally is in very good agreement with theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the Bogoliubov description and thereby confirming the smallness of quasiparticle interactions in such an elongated gas. We also discuss the presence of oscillations in the atom number, which are due to pair correlations and to the rate at which interactions are switched off.",
Cross submissions,Properties of associated Legendre conical functions,"Daniel A. Norman,Philip D. Mannheim,Tianye Liu",Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present some new properties of associated Legendre conical functions of the first and second kind, $P^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)$ and $Q^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)$. In particular we show that with the $\tau$-independent $\mathcal{R}^{K}_{n}(\chi)=(2\pi)^{-3/2}\tanh^{-K}\chi\sinh^{-1/2}\chi[\Gamma(1+K)]^{-1}\int_{0}^{2\pi} d\omega \left (1-\cos \omega/\cosh\chi\right)^{K}e^{in\omega}$ for any general $K$, we can set $P^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)=2\sum_{n}\mathcal{R}^{K}_{n}(\chi)\sin[(\tau-in)\chi)]/(\tau-in)$, where $n$ ranges from $-\ell$ to $\ell$ in unit steps when $K$ is a non-negative integer $\ell$, and from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ in unit steps otherwise. Also we can set $Q^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)=-\pi\sum_n\mathcal{R}^K_{n-K}(\chi)e^{-i \chi(\tau-i(n-K))}/(\tau-i(n-K))$, where $n$ ranges from $0$ to $2\ell$ in unit steps when $K$ is a non-negative integer $\ell$, and from $0$ to $\infty$ in unit steps otherwise. With these forms isolating the entire $\tau$ dependence, and especially its associated pole structure, we can use these forms to determine closed form expressions for integrals over $\tau$ of associated Legendre conical functions and their products. The $Q^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)$ have an integral representation containing the integral $\int_{\chi}^{\infty}d\omega e^{i\omega\tau}(\cosh\omega-\cosh\chi)^{K}$, an integral that only converges at $\omega=\infty$ if ${\rm Re}[K]<{\rm Im}[\tau]$. We show how to use the divergence of this integral outside of this range in order to characterize the complex $\tau$ plane pole structure of $Q^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)$. We present a new treatment of the Borwein integral and the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.",

In this work, we present \texttt{GENGARS} ( GEnerator of Non-Gaussian ARbitrary Shapes), a framework for generating accurate non-Gaussian initial conditions for N-body simulations. It builds upon the formulation introduced by Wagner \& Verde (2012), enabling to generate a primordial gravitational potential with a desired separable bispectrum $B_{\Phi}(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. For the local, equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussian templates, we benchmark our method against the well-established \texttt{2LPT-PNG} code. We show that \texttt{GENGARS} achieves improved accuracy and lower noise by suppressing spurious contributions to the primordial power spectrum. This paper aims at presenting the method, quantifying its performance and illustrating the benefits and applicable use cases over existing approaches.",

Cross submissions,Revisiting Polynomial Hybrid Inflation: Planck and ACT Compatibility via Radiative Corrections,"Waqas Ahmed,Saleh O. Allehabi,Mansoor Ur Rehman",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the impact of one-loop radiative corrections in a non-supersymmetric model of hybrid inflation with a chaotic (polynomial-like) potential,$V(\phi) = V_0 + \lambda_p \phi^p$, in the light of the latest constraints from \textit{Planck} and \textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope} (ACT) observations. Here, $V_0$ denotes the energy scale of inflation, and $\lambda_p$ is a coupling associated with the polynomial term of power $p$. These corrections can naturally arise from couplings of the inflaton to other matter fields, which also facilitate the reheating process. At the tree level, the predictions of such models for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ typically lie outside the current observational bounds. However, incorporating one-loop radiative corrections modifies the potential to, \[ V(\phi) = V_0 + \lambda_p \phi^p + A \phi^4 \ln (\phi/ \mu), \] where $A$ characterizes the strength of the inflaton's coupling to other fields, and \(\mu\) is an appropriate renormalization scale. This radiatively corrected potential can reconcile the model with the combined \textit{Planck}+ACT data over a suitable range of parameter space explored in this work. In particular, radiative corrections from fermionic loops ($A < 0$) suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, while simultaneously yielding a red-tilted spectrum with $n_s < 1$, even for sub-Planckian field excursions. This brings the prediction in line with current observations, while still allowing for potentially detectable signatures of primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, the inflaton's couplings enable successful reheating and naturally accommodate non-thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified framework for inflation and baryogenesis.",
Cross submissions,"Stationary Solution to Charged Hairy Black Hole in AdS4: Kasner Interior, Rotating Shock Waves, and Fast Scrambling","Hadyan Luthfan Prihadi,Rafi Rizqy Firdaus,Fitria Khairunnisa,Donny Dwiputra,Freddy Permana Zen",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider a stationary solution of a charged black hole with scalar hair in AdS$_4$, where the scalar field is coupled to a $U(1)$ Maxwell gauge field. Near the singularity, the spacetime transitions into a more general Kasner geometry. The black hole is then injected with rotating and charged gravitational shock waves in the Dray-'t Hooft solution. These shock waves lengthen the wormhole connecting the two asymptotic boundaries, thereby disrupting the correlations between them. The correlation, quantified by the quantum mutual information between subregions on the left and right boundaries, vanishes at a characteristic timescale known as the scrambling time, which depends logarithmically on the black hole entropy. The mutual information is computed holographically using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription for entanglement entropy. We investigate how the rotation and charge of both the black hole and the shock waves affect chaotic properties such as the scrambling time and the Lyapunov exponent. The interaction between the charges of the black hole and the shock waves introduces a delay in the scrambling process. We find that as the strength of the boundary deformation increases, both the Lyapunov exponent and the scrambling time delay decrease monotonically. Furthermore, the angular momentum of the shock waves enhances both the Lyapunov exponent and the scrambling time delay.",
Cross submissions,Physical implications of four dimensional braided noncommutative gravity,"Milorad Bežanić,Marija Dimitrijević Ćirić,Biljana Nikolić,Voja Radovanović",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The formulation of gravity theories on noncommutative (NC) spacetimes has been an active area of research for some time. Various models and methods have been proposed in the literature. Even within the star-product formalism, there are several distinct approaches to constructing NC deformations of General Relativity (GR) and Einstein-Cartan-Palatini (ECP) gravity. Some models are based on the NC local Lorentz symmetry, while others rely on NC deformations of the diffeomorphism symmetry of GR. In this paper, we investigate the connection between two NC gravity models based on twisted and braided NC diffeomorphism symmetry. Although these two models yield different NC gravity actions, we show that, in certain cases, they lead to the same phenomenological consequences. In particular, they share identical three-graviton vertex and exhibit some simple common vacuum solutions. This work represents a step towards understanding the diverse landscape of NC gravity models constructed within the star-product framework.",

In this model, a contribution of a given 3-manifold is given by the partition function of an abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), with a topological boundary condition at the boundary. Using the fact that the TQFT partition function depends only on the first homology group of the 3-manifold with some additional structure, the sum over all 3-manifolds with fixed boundary can be rewritten as a sum over finitely generated abelian groups (and the extra structure). We present bounds on the universal weights in the sum, that is, the measure on the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated abelian groups (with the extra structure) sufficient for the sum to be convergent. Moreover, with further assumptions on the measure, we argue the existence of a distribution of 2d TQFTs, such that the sum is equal to the ensemble average of their partition functions evaluated on the boundary. For a certain kind of measure, the sum over the abelian groups can be factorized into sums over abelian $p$-groups, and the analysis can be performed independently for each prime $p$.",

Our approach entails a quantum version of the Anderson variational double complex $\Omega(J^\infty)$ and includes Euler-Lagrange equations and a partial Noether's theorem. We show in detail how this works for a free field on a $\Bbb Z^m$ lattice regarded as a discrete noncommutative geometry, obtaining the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field, including with a general metric and gauge field background, as the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for an action. In the case of a flat metric we also obtain an exactly on-shell conserved stress-energy tensor and Noether charges for a scalar field on the lattice.",
