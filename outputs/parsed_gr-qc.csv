New submissions,Probing regular black holes with sub-Planckian curvature through periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiation,"Soroush Zare,Tao Zhu,Luis M. Nieto,Shuo Lu,Hassan Hassanabadi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are among the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors. The gravitational waveforms emitted by EMRIs are highly sensitive to the orbital dynamics of the small compact object, which in turn are determined by the geometry of the underlying spacetime. In this paper, we explore the de- tectability of regular black holes with sub-Planckian curvature, which can be interpreted as regularized versions of the Schwarzschild black hole (RSBH). To do so, we begin by ana- lyzing the metric and geodesics, determining the effective potential, and investigating the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits for timelike particles. Our analysis reveals that orbital radius, angular momentum, and energy significantly depend on the model parameter {\alpha} for both orbits. Our main aim is to focus on the influence of the model parameter on a specific kind of orbit, the periodic orbit, surrounding a supermassive RSBH. The findings show that, for a constant rational integer, {\alpha} has a significant impact on the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit. Utilising the numerical kludge method, we further investigate the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial body over various periodic orbits. The waveforms display discrete zoom and spin phases within a complete orbital period, influenced by the RSBH parameter {\alpha}. As the system evolves, the phase shift in the gravitational waveforms grows progressively more pronounced, with cumulative deviations amplifying over time. With the ongoing advancements in space- based gravitational wave detection systems, our results will aid in leveraging EMRIs to probe and characterize the RSBH properties.",
New submissions,Analytic and accurate approximate metrics for black holes with arbitrary rotation in beyond-Einstein gravity using spectral methods,"Kelvin Ka-Ho Lam,Adrian Ka-Wai Chung,Nicolás Yunes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A key obstacle for theory-specific tests of general relativity is the lack of accurate black-hole solutions in beyond-Einstein theories, especially for moderate to high spins. We address this by developing a general framework--based on spectral and pseudospectral methods--to obtain analytic, closed-form spacetimes representing stationary, axisymmetric black holes in effective-field-theory extensions of general relativity to leading order in the coupling constants. The approach models the spacetime (and extra fields) as a stationary, axisymmetric deformation of the Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist-like coordinates, expands metric deformations as a spectral series in radius and polar angle, and converts the resulting beyond-Einstein field equations into algebraic equations for the spectral coefficients. For any given spin, these equations are solved via standard linear-algebra methods; the coefficients are then fitted as functions of spin with non-linear functions, yielding fully analytic metrics for rotating black holes in beyond-Einstein theories. We apply this to quadratic gravity theories--dynamical Chern-Simons, scalar-Gauss-Bonnet, and axi-dilaton gravity--obtaining solutions valid for any spin, including near-extremal cases with errors below machine precision for $a \leq 0.9$ and $\lesssim 10^{-8}$ for $a \leq 0.999$. We show that existing slowly-rotating solutions break down at $a \sim (0.2, 0.6)$, depending on approximation order and chosen accuracy. We then use our metrics to compute observables, such as the surface gravity, horizon angular velocity, and the locations of the innermost circular orbit and the photon ring. The framework is general and applicable to other effective-field-theory extensions for black holes of any spin.",
New submissions,"On the choice of matter Lagrangian $\mathcal{L_{M}}$ in $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity","Debadri Bhattacharjee,Pradip Kumar Chattopadhyay",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The correct choice for the matter Lagrangian $(\mathcal{L_{M}})$ in the framework of $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity, has been a perennial problem. It has been a long-standing issue, whether to choose $\mathcal{L_{M}}=p$ or $-\rho$ as the proper definition of matter sector. In this work, we summarise that both choices lead to the same energy-momentum tensor. However, for these two choices, the structure of the TOV equations are different. We construct and solve TOV equations using MIT bag model equation of state for $\mathcal{L_{M}}=p$ and $-\rho$, and study the impact of the choices for matter Lagrangian on the maximum mass limit as well as M-R plot of compact stars. It is interesting to note that allowed range of gravity-matter coupling coefficient is also different for $\mathcal{L_{M}}=p$ and $\mathcal{L_{M}}=-\rho$.",
New submissions,Quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman black holes: revisiting the Dudley-Finley approximation,"Sagnik Saha,Hector O. Silva",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a comprehensive study of the Kerr-Newman quasinormal mode spectrum in the Dudley-Finley approximation, where the linear gravitoelectromagnetic perturbations are decoupled by ""freezing"" either one of the fields to its background value. First, we reassess the accuracy of this approximation by comparing it to calculations that solve the coupled system of gravitoelectromagnetic perturbation equations across the subextremal spin-charge parameter space. We find that for the $(\ell,m,n) = (2,2,0)$, $(2,2,1)$, and $(3,3,0)$ modes, the agreement is typically within $10\%$ and $1\%$ for the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies, respectively. Next, we investigate the spectrum in the near-extremal limit, and study the family of long-lived (""zero-damped"") gravitational modes. We find that the near-extremal parameter space consists of subregions containing either only zero-damped modes, or zero-damped modes alongside modes that retain nonzero damping. We derive analytic expressions for the boundaries between these regions. Moreover, we discuss the connection between the zero-damped and damped modes in the Dudley-Finley approximation and the ""near-horizon/photon-sphere"" modes of the full Kerr-Newman spectrum. Finally, we analyze the behavior of the quadrupolar gravitational modes with large overtone numbers $n$, and study their trajectories in the complex plane.",
New submissions,Binary Neutron Stars from the Moon: Early Warnings and Precision Science for the Artemis Era,"Anjali B. Yelikar,Karan Jani",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Binary neutron star mergers are unique probes of matter at extreme density and standard candles of cosmic expansion. The only such event observed in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, GW170817, revealed the origin of heavy elements, constrained the neutron star equation of state, and provided an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Current detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA capture only the final minutes of inspiral, offering limited advance warning and coarse sky localization. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of binary neutron star signals for lunar-based gravitational-wave observatories (LILA, LGWA, GLOC) envisioned within NASA's Artemis and Commercial Lunar Payload Services programs, and compare their performance with current and next-generation Earth-based facilities. For GW170817-like sources, we find that lunar detectors can forecast mergers weeks to months in advance and localize them to areas as small as 0.01 deg$^{2}$, far beyond the reach of terrestrial detectors. We further show that lunar observatories would detect on the order of 100 well-localized mergers annually, enabling coordinated multi-messenger follow-up. When combined in a multi-band LIGO+Moon network, sky-localization areas shrink to just a few arcsec$^{2}$, comparable to the field of view of the James Webb Space Telescope at high zoom. Multi-band parameter estimation also delivers dramatic gains: neutron star mass-ratio uncertainties can be measured with $\sim0.1\%$ precision, spin constraints to 0.001$\%$ with luminosity distance errors to 1$\%$ level, enabling precision measurements of the equation of state and the cosmic expansion rate. Our results demonstrate that lunar gravitational-wave observatories would revolutionize multi-messenger astrophysics with binary neutron stars and open a unique discovery landscape in the Artemis era.",
New submissions,Nonsingular Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in finite conformal quantum gravity,Diego A. Martínez-Valera,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we prove that the classical Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime is an exact solution of a class of weakly non-local, UV finite conformal quantum gravity theories, without the necessity of including a cosmological constant term in the action, thus associating the effective cosmological constant $\Lambda$ appearing in the metric with the coupling constants of the quantum gravity theory. Furthermore, exploiting the inherent conformal symmetry of the theory, we take advantage of the natural enlargement of the exact solutions to motivate the construction of a regular spacetime via conformal rescaling of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, we ensure the spacetime completeness by investigating the regularity of the curvature invariants and the geodesic completeness of conformally/non-conformally coupled massive and massless particles. We also study the global causal structure by explicitly constructing the Penrose diagram of the regular spacetime. Furthermore, as a result of the spacetime completeness analysis, we generalize the range of conformal factors that generate regular spacetimes, by considering the $N$ parameter of the conformal factor as a real parameter with a lower bound, and not only a positive integer, as constrained in previous studies on regular Schwarzschild/Kerr black holes. Thus, the present analysis broadens the range of solutions of the finite conformal quantum theory and opens the window to more precise observational tests of the theory using astrophysical data, by considering the accelerated expansion of the universe.",
New submissions,Demagnifying gravitational lenses as probes of dark matter structures and nonminimal couplings to gravity,Hong-Yi Zhang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Magnification of total image fluxes is typically considered a defining feature of gravitational microlensing. In contrast, I will show that nonminimal couplings to gravity can generate regions of negative gravitational potential curvature, giving rise to the distinctive possibility of demagnification. Such events, appearing as flux troughs in microlensing light curves, provide a direct probe of dark matter structures and, crucially, offer a means to disentangle nonminimal couplings to gravity from other astrophysical and cosmological models.",
New submissions,Motions of spinning particles in the Kerr-Newman black hole exterior and gravitational wave emission. I. Periodic orbits,"Yi-Ping Chen,Tien Hsieh,Da-Shin Lee",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The motion of a spinning particle in the exterior of the Kerr-Newman black hole is studied. The dynamics is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations in the pole-dipole approximation through the spin-curvature coupling to the leading order in its spin. In terms of conserved quantities, one can transform the dynamical equations in the Mino time into an integral form for both aligned and misaligned spins with orbital motion. These non-geodesic equations can be solved analytically with the solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions. The radial potential can be derived in order to study the parameter space of the particle for various types of orbit, based on its roots obtained with the corrections of the particle's spin. We consider motion oscillating around two turning points, which are the two outermost roots of the radial potential on the equatorial plane in the misaligned case. In this case, there is an induced oscillatory motion out of the equatorial plane. In particular, the oscillation periods of the motion are obtained. When the orbits become a source of gravitational wave emission, these periods of motion will play a key role in determining the gravitational waves in the frequency domain. Numerical kludge waveforms are constructed. The gravitational wave amplitudes are found to be sensitive to the turning points of the orbits as measured from the black holes. The implications for gravitational wave emission due to extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are discussed.",
New submissions,Dyonically charged black holes in Weyl conformal gravity,"Reinosuke Kusano,Miguel Yulo Asuncion,Keith Horne",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a parametric study of the spacetime structures in the dyonic Reissner-Nordström solution in Weyl's conformal theory of gravity. We derive expressions for photon sphere radii and horizons for this metric in terms of the conformal gravity parameters, from which we then obtain analytic formulae for extremal limits and Hawking temperatures. Due to the surprising lack of the inverse quadratic $1/r^2$ term in this fourth-order metric, there is no guarantee for the innermost horizon of a black hole spacetime to be a Cauchy horizon, which is in direct contrast to the corresponding metric in general relativity. For example, for certain parameter values, a ``nested black hole'' is seen to exist; in such a spacetime, we find a Cauchy horizon trapped between two event horizons, which is not a structure known to be obtainable in standard general relativity. In addition to such exotic spacetimes, we also find a critical value for the electric and magnetic charges, at which the stable and unstable photon spheres of the metric merge, and we obtain extremal limits where three horizons collide.",
New submissions,Pulsar timing array analysis in a Legendre polynomial basis,"Bruce Allen,Arian L. von Blanckenburg,Ken D. Olum",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We use Legendre polynomials (previously discussed in this context by Pitrou and Cusin [1]) to model signals in pulsar timing arrays (PTA). These replace the (Fourier mode) basis of trigonometric functions normally used for data analysis. The Legendre basis makes it simpler to incorporate pulsar modeling effects, which remove constant-, linear-, and quadratic-in-time terms from pulsar timing residuals. In the Legendre basis, this zeroes the amplitudes of the the first three Legendre polynomials. We use this basis to construct an optimal quadratic cross-correlation estimator $\widehat{\mu}$ of the Hellings and Downs (HD) correlation and compute its variance $\sigma^2_{\widehat{\mu}}$ in the way described by Allen and Romano [2]. Remarkably, if the gravitational-wave background (GWB) and pulsar noise power spectra are (sums of) power laws in frequency, then in this basis one obtains analytic closed forms for many quantities of interest.",
New submissions,Primary Proca Hair and the Double-Peak Optics of Black Holes,"R. A. Konoplya,D. Ovchinnikov,J. Schee",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the optical properties of black holes endowed with primary Proca hair, focusing on the distinctive double-peak structure generated in the effective potential by the massive vector field. This novel feature drastically modifies the geodesic motion of both photons and massive particles, leading to qualitatively new dynamical and observational signatures. We derive and analyze the effective potentials, classify time-like and null geodesics, and identify the conditions for multiple circular orbits. Particular attention is devoted to the photon sphere structure, the associated shadows, and lensing phenomena. Our analysis reveals that, for a broad range of parameters, the black-hole shadow can acquire a two-boundary structure and exhibit additional inner rings, unlike the standard Schwarzschild case. These modifications provide potentially observable imprints of Proca hair in electromagnetic spectra, highlighting the relevance of double-barrier optical phenomena for current and future observations of strong-gravity environments.",
New submissions,"Observational constraints on f(Q,T) gravity from the mass-radius relation and stability of compact stars","S. K. Maurya,Abdul Aziz,Ksh. Newton Singh,G. Mustafa,Y. Sekhmani,Saibal Ray",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this investigation we examine the astrophysical consequences of the influence of pressure anisotropy on the physical properties of observed pulsars within the background of $f(Q,T)$ gravity by choosing a specific form $f(Q, T)=\psi_1\, Q + \psi_2 T$, where $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are the model parameters. Initially, we solve the modified field equations for anisotropic stellar configurations by assuming the physically valid metric potential along with anisotropic function for the distribution of the interior matter. We test the derived gravitational model subject to various stability conditions to confirm physically existence of compact stars within the $f(Q,T)$ gravity context. We analyze thoroughly the influence of anisotropy on the effective density, pressure and mass-radius relation of the stars. The present inspection of the model implies that the current gravitational models are non-singular and able to justify for the occurrence of observed pulsars with masses exceeding 2 $M_{\odot}$ as well as masses fall in the {\em mass gap} regime, in particular merger events like GW190814. The predicted radii for the observed stars of different masses fall within the range \{10.5 km, 14.5 km\} for $\psi_1\leq 1.05$ whereas the radius of PSR J074+6620 is predicted to fall within \{13.09 km, 14.66 km\} which is in agreement with the predicted radii range \{11.79 km, 15.01 km\} as can be found in the recent literature.",
New submissions,Studying the gravitational-wave population without looking that FAR out,"Noah E. Wolfe,Matthew Mould,Jack Heinzel,Salvatore Vitale",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"From catalogs of gravitational-wave transients, the population-level properties of their sources and the formation channels of merging compact binaries can be constrained. However, astrophysical conclusions can be biased by misspecification or misestimation of the population likelihood. Despite detection thresholds on the false-alarm rate (FAR) or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the current catalog is likely contaminated by noise transients. Further, computing the population likelihood becomes less accurate as the catalog grows. Current methods to address these challenges often scale poorly with the number of events and potentially become infeasible for future catalogs. Here, we evaluate a simple remedy: increasing the significance threshold for including events in population analyses. To determine the efficacy of this approach, we analyze simulated catalogs of up to 1600 gravitational-wave signals from black-hole mergers using full Bayesian parameter estimation with current detector sensitivities. We show that the growth in statistical uncertainty about the black-hole population, as we analyze fewer events but with higher SNR, depends on the source parameters of interest. When the SNR threshold is raised from 11 to 15 -- reducing our catalog size by two--thirds -- we find that statistical uncertainties on the mass distribution only grow by a few 10% and constraints on the spin distribution are essentially unchanged; meanwhile, uncertainties on the high-redshift cosmic merger rate more than double. Simultaneously, numerical uncertainty in the estimate of the population likelihood more than halves, allowing us to ensure unbiased inference without additional computational expense. Our results demonstrate that focusing on higher-significance events is an effective way to facilitate robust astrophysical inference with growing gravitational-wave catalogs.",
Cross submissions,Asymptotically Flat Rotating Topological Stars,"Pierre Heidmann,Paolo Pani,Jorge E. Santos",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We construct a new class of smooth, horizonless, non-supersymmetric solutions in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, which we call rotating topological stars. Built from a Kerr-Taub-bolt geometry embedded in five dimensions, they constitute the first rotating generalization of the topological star compatible with both smoothness in the interior and standard Kaluza-Klein asymptotics, S$^1\times\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$. The solutions carry angular momentum, magnetic and electric charges, and form a discrete tower of states labeled by a primary quantum number controlling the spin. Remarkably, despite lying outside the black-hole extremality bound, they can approach arbitrarily closely (in conserved charges) the Kerr black string with a large boost along the fifth dimension, making them relevant prototypes for rotating and astrophysical black-hole microstates. We analyze their geometry in detail, including their gravitational multipoles that can significantly deviate from those of black holes and the presence of an ergoregion, and show that both geodesics and scalar perturbations separate, paving the way for analyzing their dynamics in future work.",
Cross submissions,Testing the arrow of time at the cosmo collider,"Shuntaro Aoki,Alessandro Strumia",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Normal particles carry a microscopic arrow of causality. Lee-Wick ghosts carry the reversed arrow, mediating characteristic collider signals in flat space: opposite-sign scattering amplitudes that violate positivity bounds; acausality on time scales set by their negative decay rate. During inflation, the corresponding cosmo-collider ghost signals are: opposite-sign non-Gaussianities; Boltzmann-unsuppressed local oscillatory signals without their non-local counterparts; IR-enhanced bi-spectrum and power spectrum, depending on the dimension of the interaction operator, which decreases if the ghost decay rate is comparable to the Hubble rate.",
Cross submissions,Positive Spin-induced Quadrupole Moment in String Theory,"Iosif Bena,Angèle Lochet",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We identify singularity-free Running-Kerr-Taub-Bolt solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity that descend to four-dimensional rotating solutions with flat-space asymptotics. We compute their spin-induced quadrupole moment and find that for a certain range of charges this quadrupole moment is positive. This behavior differs from the Kerr black hole and from most other spinning objects constructed with ``normal'' four-dimensional matter, and we discuss the top-down physics of these solutions that could be responsible for this unusual behavior.",
Cross submissions,Primordial Black Holes at the Junction,"James B. Dent,Bhaskar Dutta,Mudit Rai",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during first-order phase transitions provide a powerful link between the early-universe microphysics and observable signatures today, including dark matter and gravitational waves. In this work we develop a unified description of PBH formation based on the Israel junction conditions, which capture collapse dynamics without relying on conventional overdensity or pressure-balance arguments. As a first application, we show that exotic objects such as Fermi-balls can collapse into PBHs even when most of the vacuum energy is trapped in solitonic cores, leading to a different gravitational-wave signal relative to vacuum-only scenarios. As a second application, we study multiple phase transitions in a hidden sector, which generate correlated gravitational-wave spectra and PBH abundances across transitions. Our framework, while analytically controlled, is broadly applicable to hidden-sector models with general vacuum, radiation, and matter contributions. We present the resulting predictions for PBH mass spectra, dark matter fractions, and gravitational-wave signals, highlighting parameter regions that remain open in current searches and motivating future probes.",
Cross submissions,"Holographic CFT phase transitions and criticality for charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$",Limin Zeng,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of spherically symmetric, charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The gravitational thermodynamics of Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes can be extended by allowing for variations of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant. In the dual CFT this corresponds to including the central charge C and its chemical potential $\mu$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables. In addition, compared to Einstein's theory of gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity introduces higher-order curvature terms. The coupling constants of these higher-order curvature terms $\alpha$ can serve as new thermodynamic quantities, which will also be dual to thermodynamic quantities on the boundary CFT, a feature not present in the CFT dual to Einstein's gravity previously. Based on the holographic dictionary, we consider the critical behavior and phase transition phenomena of the CFT description of the charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in $d=4$ and $d=5$ in ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$. We find that the conventional description of free energy cannot adequately describe the phase transitions and critical behavior of the CFT in this ensemble. Perhaps a new understanding and description should be introduced.",
Cross submissions,Luminosity distance dispersion in Swiss-cheese cosmology as a function of the hole size distribution,"Thippayawis Cheunchitra,Andrew Melatos,Rachel Webster",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The luminosity distance-redshift ($D_{\rm L}$--$z$) relation derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) yields evidence for a nonzero cosmological constant. SNe Ia analyses typically fit to the functional form $D_{\rm L}(z)$ derived theoretically from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Yet, the metric in the epoch relevant to SNe Ia measurements deviates slightly from FLRW due to gravitational clumping of mass into large-scale structures like filaments and voids, whose sizes span many orders of magnitude. The small deviation is modeled typically by scalar perturbations to the FLRW metric. Each line of sight to a SNe Ia passes through a random sequence of structures, so $D_{\rm L}$ differs stochastically from one line of sight to the next. Here, we calculate the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion in an exact Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese universe with a power-law hole size distribution, as a function of the lower cut-off $R_{\rm min}$ and logarithmic slope $\gamma$. We find that the standard deviation of $D_{\rm L}$ scales as $\sigma_{D_{\rm L}} \propto z^{2.25\pm0.01} (R_{\rm min}/24\pm1\,{\rm Mpc})^{(0.157\pm0.003)\left[\gamma - (1.16\pm0.02)\right]}$ for redshifts in the range $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.1$. The scaling shows that the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion is dominated by a few large voids rather than the many small voids.",
Cross submissions,Radiative-Corrected Higgs Inflation in Light of the Latest ACT Observations,"Jureeporn Yuennan,Farruh Atamurotov,Phongpichit Channuie",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), particularly when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, have reported a scalar spectral index $n_s$ slightly higher than that inferred by {\it Planck}~2018, suggesting a mild tension with the predictions of standard inflationary attractor models. In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.9743$ and $r \simeq 5.4\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \textit{Planck}~2018 limit $r < 0.036$. The derived constraint $4.36\times10^{-10} < \lambda/\xi^{2} < 10.77\times10^{-10}$ confirms the robustness of the quantum-corrected Higgs framework and indicates that near-future CMB polarization experiments such as CORE, AliCPT, LiteBIRD, and CMB-S4 will be able to probe the predicted parameter space with high precision.",
Cross submissions,"Accretion, Jets, and Recoil in Merging Supermassive Binary Black Holes","Maria Chiara de Simone,Manuela Campanelli,Lorenzo Ennoggi,Carlos O. Lousto,Yosef Zlochower(RIT)",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We report the first 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation that captures the full, self-consistent evolution from the late inspiral through merger and subsequent recoil of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) with misaligned spins embedded in an equilibrated circumbinary disk (CBD). Our full numerical simulation follows the final 40 orbits of the inspiral and merger of the binary, following an initial phase of 165 orbits of CBD evolution toward equilibrium. We find that the jets, launched from the minidisks surrounding each black hole, are tilted toward the black hole spin direction close to the individual black holes, but align with the binary's total angular momentum at larger distances. Following the merger, the remnant black hole receives a recoil kick exceeding 1000 km/s. Remarkably, it retains its gravitationally bound CBD as if it were ejected from a galactic nucleus. Furthermore, the jet launched by the recoiling remnant black hole preserves the large-scale orientation established during the late inspiral. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity emerges from a region in close proximity to the black hole, suggesting that the accretion disk surrounding the recoiling remnant would remain the most luminous feature postmerger, persisting for long enough to be observable by modern telescopes (hours in the case of LISA sources). These findings introduce a direct, first-principles model for the recoil of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), offering a comprehensive theoretical basis to support and elucidate both ongoing and future observational efforts.",
Cross submissions,Stochastic Gravitational Waves from Modulated Reheating,"Michele Benaco,Dimitrios Karamitros,Sami Nurmi,Kimmo Tuominen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We investigate scalar-induced stochastic gravitational waves from adiabatic curvature perturbations sourced by a spectator field via the modulated reheating mechanism. We consider a spectator scalar with Higgs-like couplings and inflaton decay via shift symmetric dimension-five operators. The spectator is assumed to be in the Sitter vacuum and it sources blue-tilted, strongly non-Gaussian curvature perturbations which can dominate the spectrum on small scales $k \gg \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We find that the setup could generate a gravitational wave signal testable by surveys like BBO and DECIGO but only for large coupling values not expected in low-energy particle physics setups that can be perturbatively extrapolated up to the inflationary scale.",
Cross submissions,Multiprobe constraints on early and late time dark energy,"Alexander Reeves,Simone Ferraro,Andrina Nicola,Alexandre Refregier",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We perform a multiprobe analysis combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), ACT CMB lensing, and large-scale structure (LSS) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), including DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (LS) galaxies and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). We present the first $5\times2$pt analysis of ACT DR6 lensing, DESI LS, and Planck ISW. Within $\Lambda$CDM, this yields $S_8 = \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.819 \pm 0.016$, in good agreement with primary CMB inferences and provides a sound-horizon-free Hubble constant constraint of $H_0 = 70.0 \pm 4.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Then, combining with CMB primary and BAO, we reconfirm a CMB-BAO discrepancy in the $\Omega_m$-$\frac{D_v}{r_d}$ plane, which is heightened when combining BAO with the $5\times2$pt data vector. We explore two dark-energy extensions that may reconcile this: an early-time modification, early dark energy (EDE), and late-time dynamical dark energy (DDE) parameterized by $w_0w_a$. For CMB primary+BAO+$5\times2$pt, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for DDE over $\Lambda$CDM, while EDE is modestly favoured at $2.3\sigma$. The models address different shortcomings of $\Lambda$CDM: DDE relaxes the neutrino mass bound ($M_\nu<0.17$eV vs. $<0.050$eV under $\Lambda$CDM), making it compatible with neutrino oscillation measurements, while EDE raises the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.5\pm1.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, easing the discrepancy with SH0ES. However, neither model resolves both issues simultaneously. Our analysis indicates that both DDE and EDE remain viable extensions of $\Lambda$CDM within current uncertainties and demonstrates the capacity of combined probes to place increasingly stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.",
