New submissions,On the Viability of Weak Energy Condition Violation in Parity-Violating Electrodynamics,Tao Huang,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore a parity-violating extension to the Einstein-Maxwell theory within the framework of effective field theory (EFT). The model is characterized by a dimension-eight operator, suppressed by the fourth power of a new physics energy scale $\Lambda$, which couples the electromagnetic field strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ to its dual. This operator, proportional to $(F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta})(F_{\gamma\delta}\tilde{F}^{\gamma\delta})$, introduces a non-linear modification to both gravitational and electromagnetic dynamics. We derive the complete set of self-consistent field equations from the modified action. The gravitational field equations reveal that the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor's contribution to spacetime curvature is modulated by a factor $\Omega$ that depends linearly on $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$. A sufficiently large and positive $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$ could, in principle, render this factor negative, leading to a violation of the weak energy condition (WEC). However, the primary focus of this work is to assess the physical viability of such a scenario. We analyze the model's key phenomenological prediction: vacuum birefringence. By comparing our predictions with stringent constraints from high-precision terrestrial experiments like PVLAS and astrophysical observations of magnetars, we establish a robust lower bound on the new physics scale, $\Lambda \gtrsim 100$ TeV. This bound implies that the threshold for WEC violation is orders of magnitude beyond the field strengths observed anywhere in the universe, effectively suppressing this phenomenon. We conclude by discussing the theoretical self-consistency of the model and presenting an exact solution at the WEC violation threshold.",
New submissions,Dirac Oscillator for Spin-1/2 Particles in a Spinning Cosmic String Spacetime with Spacelike Disclination and Dislocation,Abdelmalek Boumali,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the Dirac oscillator for spin-1/2 particles in a spacetime containing a spinning cosmic string endowed with both curvature (disclination) and torsion (screw dislocation). The background geometry includes off-diagonal and is analyzed through a local tetrad formalism. Working in cylindrical coordinates, we derive the covariant Dirac equation and solve it exactly via a second-order differential equation for the lower spinor component. Three distinct physical configurations are examined: (i) balanced torsion where temporal and spatial contributions are equal, (ii) purely temporal torsion (spinning string), and (iii) purely spatial torsion (screw dislocation). In all cases, we obtain exact energy spectra expressed in terms of effective angular quantum numbers that depend on the oscillator frequency, the angular deficit parameter \alpha , the torsional parameters J_{t} and J_{z}, and the longitudinal momentum k. The resulting energy levels generalize the flat-spacetime Moshinsky oscillator spectrum by incorporating energy- and momentum-dependent shifts due to the background geometry. We show that curvature and torsion lift degeneracies and induce nontrivial modifications to the angular structure of the solutions. The flat-space spectrum is recovered as a special limit when both curvature and torsion vanish. This work provides a fully solvable model that illustrates how spacetime defects affect relativistic quantum systems, offering insights relevant to both high-energy physics and condensed-matter analogs.",
New submissions,The Great Impersonation: $\mathcal{W}$-Solitons as Prototypical Black Hole Microstates,"Alexandru Dima,Pierre Heidmann,Marco Melis,Paolo Pani,Gela Patashuri",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We analyze a new class of static, smooth geometries in five-dimensional supergravity, dubbed $\mathcal{W}$-solitons. They carry the same mass and charges as four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr√∂m-like black holes but replace the horizon with a Kaluza-Klein bubble supported by electromagnetic flux. These solutions provide analytically tractable prototypes of black hole microstates in supergravity, including a new, astrophysically relevant neutral configuration involving a massless axion field. Focusing on photon scattering and scalar perturbations, we compute their key observables. We find that $\mathcal{W}$-solitons feature a single photon sphere, qualitatively similar to that of the black hole but with quantitative differences. They have only short-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs), as black holes, while long-lived echo modes seen in other ultracompact horizonless objects are absent. As a result, the ringdown closely resembles that of a black hole while still showing sizable deviations. The latter are at the ${\mathcal{O}}(10\%)$ level, compatible with the recent measurement of GW250114 and potentially falsifiable in the near future. Finally, we show that $\mathcal{W}$-solitons are stable under scalar perturbations. Our results underscore the qualitative similarities between $\mathcal{W}$-solitons and black holes, reinforcing their relevance as smooth black hole microstate prototypes.",
New submissions,Cyclic Kruskal Universe: a quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole in unitary unimodular gravity,"Steffen Gielen,Sofie Ried",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We analyse the physical properties of an analytical, nonsingular quantum-corrected black hole solution recently derived in a minisuperspace model for unimodular gravity under the assumption of unitarity in unimodular time. We show that the metric corrections compared to the classical Schwarzschild solutions only depend on a single new parameter, corresponding to a minimal radius where a black hole-white hole transition occurs. While these corrections substantially alter the structure of the spacetime near this minimal radius, they fall off rapidly towards infinity, and we show in various examples how physical properties of the exterior spacetime are very close to those of the Schwarzschild solution. We derive the maximal analytic extension of the initial solution, which corresponds to an infinite sequence of Kruskal spacetimes connected via black-to-white hole transitions, and compare with some other proposals for non-singular black hole metrics. The metric violates the achronal averaged null energy condition, which indicates that we are capturing physics beyond the semiclassical approximation. Finally, we include some thoughts on how to go beyond the simple eternal black hole-white hole model presented here.",
New submissions,Exploring Black Hole Environments,Thomas F.M. Spieksma,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The past decade has transformed our ability to observe the Universe. Via gravitational waves, merging black holes and neutron stars can now be directly detected, offering unprecedented opportunities to test General Relativity and explore astrophysics in a new way. Driven by this breakthrough, the next generation of detectors is being developed to observe a wider range of sources with greater precision, ushering in a new era in gravitational-wave astronomy: leveraging black holes as probes of new physics.This thesis investigates how astrophysical environments, such as plasma, dark-matter structures, and clouds of ultralight bosons, affect black holes and their gravitational-wave signatures. After a short overview of gravitational-wave astrophysics, I study three classes of scenarios. (i) Isolated black holes: I examine boson clouds around black holes, their electromagnetic couplings and the role of surrounding plasma. (ii) Ringdown: I show that plasma can strongly modify the ringdown of charged black holes, whereas realistic dark-matter halos produce no detectable deviations even for next-generation detectors. (iii) Inspiral: for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals with boson clouds, I find that orbital resonances typically destroy the cloud unless the orbit is nearly counter-rotating, yielding new and exciting observational signatures. Entering the relativistic regime, I develop a self-consistent perturbative framework to model generic environments in extreme-mass-ratio binaries and apply it to the boson-cloud case. Finally, I construct a model for binaries repeatedly crossing active galactic-nucleus disks and track their long-term orbital evolution. The results of this thesis show how black hole environments shape gravitational-wave signals and open avenues for testing new physics with future observatories such as LISA or the Einstein Telescope.",
New submissions,Localized five-dimensional rotating brane-world black hole Analytically Connected to an to an AdS$_5$ boundary,"Milko Estrada,Francisco Tello-Ortiz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We provide a method to describe the geometry of an analytic, exponentially localized $5D$ rotating braneworld black hole, using the $5D$ Janis Newman algorithm in Hopf coordinates. The induced metric on the brane matches the standard $4D$ Kerr spacetime. Two curvature singularities arise: one confined to the $3$-brane at $z = r = 0$, and another that, on the brane, reproduces the Kerr singularity at $r = 0$, $\bar{\theta} = \pi/2$. The inner and event horizons, together with the stationary limit hypersurfaces, extend into the extra dimension in a pancake-like shape. We describe their behavior in the bulk.The energy momentum tensor represents a source transitioning from an anisotropic, non diagonal structure to a vacuum with negative cosmological constant. Thus, the localized black hole connects to an AdS$_5$ boundary. The geometry is supported by a non-diagonal anisotropic fluid in the bulk, requiring no matter on the brane. To evaluate the energy conditions, we use a one form from the dual basis that yields a diagonal energy momentum tensor.",
New submissions,Semianalytic calculation of the gravitational wave spectrum induced by curvature perturbations,Takahiro Terada,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background is secondarily and inevitably induced by the primordial curvature perturbations beyond the first order of the cosmological perturbation theory. We analytically calculate the integration kernel of the power spectrum of the induced GWs, which is the universal part independent of the spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations, in the radiation-dominated era and in the matter-dominated era. We derive fully analytic expressions of the GW spectrum when possible. As a minor update, we study the case of the top-hat function as the spectrum of the curvature perturbations. We also discuss generalization in the presence of multiple cosmological eras with different equations of state.",
New submissions,Cosmological Perturbation in New General Relativity: Propagating mode from the violation of local Lorentz invariance,"Kyosuke Tomonari,Taishi Katsuragawa,Shin'ichi Nojiri",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the propagating modes of New General Relativity (NGR) in second-order linear perturbations in the Lagrangian density (first-order in field equations). The Dirac-Bergmann analysis has revealed a violation of local Lorentz invariance in NGR. We review the recent status of NGR, considering the results of its Dirac-Bergmann analysis. We then reconsider the vierbein perturbation framework and identify the origin of each perturbation field in the vierbein field components. This identification is mandatory for adequately fixing gauges while guaranteeing consistency with the invariance guaranteed by the Dirac-Bergmann analysis. We find that the spatially flat gauge is adequate for analyzing a theory with the violation of local Lorentz invariance. Based on the established vierbein perturbative framework, introducing a real scalar field as a test matter, we perform a second-order perturbative analysis of NGR with respect to tensor, scalar, pseudo-scalar, and vector and pseudo-vector modes. We reveal the possible propagating modes of each type of NGR. In particular, we find that Type 3 has stable five propagating modes, \textit{i.e.}, tensor, scalar, and vector modes, compared to five non-linear degrees of freedom, which results in its Dirac-Bergmann analysis; Type 3 is preferable for the application to cosmology. Finally, we discuss our results in comparison to previous related work and conclude this study.",
New submissions,Can you fall into a McVittie black hole? Will you survive?,Brien C. Nolan,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Yes and maybe. In contrast to the fluid particles of this perfect fluid spacetime which follow non-geodesic world-lines and escape to infinity, we prove that freely-falling test particles of McVittie spacetime can reach the black hole horizon in finite proper time. We review the relevant evidence and argue that the fate of an extended test body is less clear. More precisely: we consider expanding McVittie spacetimes with a non-negative cosmological constant. In each member of this class, we identify a region of the spacetime such that an observer following an initially-ingoing timelike geodesic crosses the black hole horizon of the spacetime in a finite amount of proper time. The curvature behaves in interesting ways along these geodesics. In the case of a positive cosmological constant, curvature scalars (of zero, first and second order in derivatives), Jacobi fields and parallel propagated (p.p.) frame components of the curvature remain finite along timelike geodesics running into the black hole horizon. For a vanishing cosmological constant, scalar curvature terms of zero and first order as well as Jacobi fields remain finite in this limit. However, scalar curvature terms of second order diverge, and we show that there are p.p.\ frame components of the curvature tensor that also diverge in this limit. We argue that this casts a doubt as to whether or not an extended test body can survive crossing the black hole horizon in this case.",
New submissions,Post-collapse Lagrangian perturbation theory in three dimensions,"Shohei Saga,St√©phane Colombi,Atsushi Taruya,Cornelius Rampf,Abineet Parichha",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The gravitational collapse of collisionless matter leads to shell-crossing singularities that challenge the applicability of standard perturbation theory. Here, we present the first fully perturbative approach in three dimensions by using Lagrangian coordinates that asymptotically captures the highly nonlinear nature of matter evolution after the first shell-crossing. This is made possible essentially thanks to two basic ingredients: (1) We employ high-order standard Lagrangian perturbation theory to evolve the system until shell-crossing, and (2) we exploit the fact that the density caustic structure near the first shell-crossing begins generically with pancake formation. The latter property allows us to exploit largely known one-dimensional results to determine perturbatively the gravitational backreaction after collapse, yielding accurate solutions within our post-collapse perturbation theory (PCPT) formalism. We validate the PCPT predictions against high-resolution Vlasov-Poisson simulations and demonstrate that PCPT provides a robust framework for describing the early stages of post-collapse dynamics.",
New submissions,Regular black hole formation in four-dimensional non-polynomial gravities,"Pablo Bueno,Pablo A. Cano,Robie A. Hennigar,√Ångel J. Murcia",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We construct four-dimensional gravity theories that resolve the Schwarzschild singularity and enable dynamical studies of nonsingular gravitational collapse. The construction employs a class of nonpolynomial curvature invariants that produce actions with (i) second-order equations of motion in spherical symmetry and (ii) a Birkhoff theorem, ensuring uniqueness of the spherically symmetric solution. Upon spherical reduction to two dimensions, these theories map to a particular subclass of Horndeski scalar-tensor models, which we use to explicitly verify the formation of regular black holes as the byproduct of the collapse of pressureless stars and thin-shells. We also show that linear perturbations on top of maximally symmetric backgrounds are governed by second-order equations.",
New submissions,Intrinsic Heisenberg Lower Bounds on Schwarzschild and Weyl-Class Spacelike Slices,Thomas Sch√ºrmann,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We establish a coordinate-invariant Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r_g$ on horizon-regular spacelike slices of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat (AF) black-holes. Via a variance-eigenvalue equivalence the momentum uncertainty reduces to the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, yielding a slice-uniform Hardy baseline $\sigma_p r_g \ge \hbar/2$ under mild convexity assumptions on the balls; the bound is never attained and admits a positive gap both on compact interior regions and uniformly far out. For the Schwarzschild Painlev√©-Gullstrand (PG) slice, whose induced 3-geometry is Euclidean, one recovers the exact Euclidean scale $\sigma_p r_g \ge \pi\hbar$, which is optimal among all admissible slices. The entire construction extends across the black-hole horizon, and it transfers to the static axisymmetric Weyl class, where the Hardy floor, strict gap, and AF $\pi$-scale persist (a global PG-like optimum need not exist).",
Cross submissions,Counting Degrees of Freedom: A Method Applicable from Scalars to f(Q) Gravity and Beyond,Lavinia Heisenberg,Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a clear, step-by-step method for counting degrees of freedom and identifying constraints in general field theories. This approach, grounded in the works of Einstein, Hilbert, Cartan, Kuranishi, and, more recently, Seiler, is neither Lagrangian nor Hamiltonian in nature. Instead, it applies directly to the field equations. We offer a transparent physical interpretation of the method, establish new results, and explore a broad set of examples to demonstrate its power and generality. Notably, we apply the method to $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where traditional techniques such as the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm are ineffective, and obtain seven propagating degrees of freedom.",
Cross submissions,Binary black holes gone MAD: Magnetically arrested minidisks around nonspinning black holes,"Vikram Manikantan,Vasileios Paschalidis",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We demonstrate the formation of magnetically arrested minidisks (MAM) around equal-mass, nonspinning binary black holes with magnetohydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary disk accretion in full 3+1 general relativity. The initial separation of $d\sim 30\,M$ allows the black holes to host large minidisks that suppress the total rest-mass accretion rate variability, which is modulated primarily at $\sim 1.6 \, f_{\rm orb}$. Each black hole horizon saturates with dimensionless magnetic flux $\phi \sim 30$. Magnetic reconnection near the horizons drives recurrent eruptions which are expected to drive flaring in the infrared and X-ray bands. Our results establish MAMs as a new outcome of circumbinary disk accretion, and a promising source of novel electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves from binary black holes.",
Cross submissions,One loop aspects of Coleman de Luccia instantons at small backreaction,Victor Ivo,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We discuss the Euclidean path integral around Coleman de Luccia instantons. We compute their contribution at the one-loop level, at leading order in the small backreaction limit. At this level of approximation, their contribution factorizes into a pure gravity and a pure matter contribution. In deriving this result, we also clarify what happens to some zero mode contributions to the path integral, once the symmetry responsible for them is broken. With these results established, we propose a formula for the decay rate of the false vacuum in terms of gravitational path integrals, and we show that our definition matches the usual quantum field theory result as $G_{N}\rightarrow0$. Lastly, we propose a prescription to study how the phase of the gravity+matter path integral changes as we change the parameters of the theory.",
Cross submissions,Listening to the long ringdown: A novel way to pinpoint the EOS in neutron-star cores,"Christian Ecker,Tyler Gorda,Aleksi Kurkela,Luciano Rezzolla",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnants complement constraints from the inspiral phase, mass-radius measurements, and microscopic theory by providing information about the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) at extreme densities. We perform general-relativistic simulations of BNS mergers using EOS models that span the uncertain high-density regime. We find a robust correlation between the ratio of energy and angular momentum lost during the late-time post-merger GW signal - the long ringdown - and the EOS at the highest densities in neutron star cores. Applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals reduces EOS uncertainty at several times saturation density, where no direct constraints currently exist.",
Cross submissions,Dynamical Triangulations for 2D Pure Gravity and Topological Recursion,"Hiroyuki Fuji,Masahide Manabe,Yoshiyuki Watabiki",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We show that, in two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity without matter fields, the Schwinger-Dyson equations derived within the Hamiltonian framework of non-critical string field theory can be reformulated in terms of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion, and we explicitly compute the associated low-order amplitudes. In particular, we establish this reformulation for two discrete models -- the basic type and the strip type -- as well as for the continuum limit of dynamical triangulations.",
Cross submissions,Exact WKB Formulation of Quantization and Particle Production in Time-Dependent Backgrounds,"Ryo Namba,Motoo Suzuki",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Divergence in perturbative expansions is where interesting physics takes place. Particle production on time-dependent backgrounds, as one such example, is interpreted as transition from one vacuum to another. Vacuum is typically defined as an asymptotic state in which the WKB approximation is valid. The use of the WKB method, however, poses several conceptual and computational issues, as the WKB series is divergent in general, quantization is insensitive to higher orders in the series, and the global behavior of solutions cannot be captured. Exact WKB analysis is a powerful resummation technology that provides an analytical tool for a global structure of exact solutions to overcome these problems. In this paper, we establish quantization by fully employing the exact WKB solutions as mode functions and by defining the vacua with respect to them. We provide a self-contained exact WKB formulation to obtain evolution matrices without resorting to the use of known special functions and without approximations. We find that the quantity called Voros coefficient plays an important role to re-normalize the exact WKB solutions compatible with asymptotic states. We show that the ambiguity that coexists with nontrivial Voros coefficients is eliminated by requiring physical quantization conditions. Our formalism provides a conceptual as well as practical framework to upgrade our treatment of quantization and particle production. Combined with other approximating techniques, it can form a basis to tackle a broad class of problems that are beyond technical ability of the existing formulations.",
