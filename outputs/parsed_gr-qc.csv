New submissions,The Influence of Uniform Magnetic Fields on Strong Field Gravitational Lensing by Kerr Black Holes,"Amnish Vachher,Arun Kumar,Sushant G. Ghosh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate strong gravitational lensing using magnetized Kerr black holes (MKBHs), which are accurate Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson solutions for Kerr black holes in a uniform magnetic field with additional magnetic field strength $B$ apart from mass $M$ and spin $a$. Unlike previous magnetized spacetimes, the MKBH geometry is Petrov type D, devoid of conical singularities, allowing photons to reach asymptotic infinity and making the concept astrophysically feasible. We use the strong deflection limit formalism to calculate the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, deflection angle, and lensing observables including the image position $\theta_\infty$, angular separation $s$ and relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$, as well as their relationships with the parameters $a$ and $B$. Our results reveal that the relativistic image's photon sphere and angular size increase with $B$, whereas lensing observables deviate significantly from the Kerr scenario. For M87*, with $a=0.9$, the angular position of relativistic images increases from $10.8~\mu$as (Kerr) to $12.02~\mu$as, and the time delay between the first two images increases from $158.5$ h to $176$ h at $B=0.4$. Similarly, for Sgr A*, the image position increases from $14.4~\mu$as to $16~\mu$as, with time delays enhanced by approximately $0.7$ minutes. The relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$ grows with $B$ and deviates by $0.53$ from Kerr black holes at $B=0.4$. Our findings highlight strong gravitational lensing as a powerful tool to probe the presence of magnetic fields around astrophysical black holes, and in particular, we demonstrate that the MKBH spacetime enables constraints on the parameters $a$ and $B$.",
New submissions,Power-Law and Logarithmic Entropy-Corrected Ricci Dark Energy in a Non-Flat FRW Universe with Viscous Interaction,Antonio Pasqua,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we consider the logarithmic-corrected and the power-law corrected versions of the holographic dark energy (HDE) model in the non-flat FRW universe filled with a viscous Dark Energy (DE) interacting with Dark Matter (DM). We propose to replace the infra-red cut-off with the inverse of the Ricci scalar curvature $R$. We obtain the equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{\Lambda}$, the deceleration parameter $q$ and the evolution of energy density parameter $\omega_{\Lambda} '$in the presence of interaction between DE and DM for both corrections. We study the correspondence of the power-law entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (PLECRDE) and the logarithmic entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (LECRDE) models with the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), the Modified Variable Chaplygin Gas (MVCG), the New Modified Chaplygin Gas (NMCG), the Yang-Mills (YM) and the Non Linear Electro-Dynamics (NLED) scalar field models.",
New submissions,PRECESSION 2.1: black-hole binary spin precession on eccentric orbits,"Giulia Fumagalli,Davide Gerosa,Nicholas Loutrel",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We present version 2.1 of the public code {\sc precession}, a Python module for studying the post-Newtonian dynamics of precessing black hole binaries. In this release, we extend the code to handle eccentric orbits. This extension leverages the existing numerical infrastructure wherever possible, introducing a semi-automatic method to adapt circular-orbit functions to the eccentric case via a Python decorator. Additional new features include orbit- and precession-averaged evolutionary equations for the eccentricity, as well as revised expressions to convert between post-Newtonian separation and gravitational-wave emission frequency.",
New submissions,Intermediate mass-ratio inspirals in a dense dark-matter environment: Effects of the initial dark-matter distribution,"Benjamin A. Wade,David A. Nichols",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Recent work has shown the possibility of detecting dense dark-matter distributions surrounding intermediate or extreme mass-ratio inspirals through gravitational waves using LISA. Modeling these systems requires evolving the coupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting reasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself relies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this paper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories shape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger events. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of dark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been accreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a distribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from a vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly for more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place within a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find that the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior inspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the environmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial data are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors.",
New submissions,Loopy Black-Hole Remnants,Asier Alonso-Bardaji,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The quantized area predicted by loop quantum gravity suggests the existence of a lower bound for black-hole horizons. We prove this intuition within a covariant effective model for spherical loop quantum gravity, where nonsingular quasi-static black holes evaporate until their horizons attain the smallest positive eigenvalue of the area operator. Consistent with the third law of black-hole thermodynamics, this final state -- characterized by vanishing temperature and entropy -- cannot be realized in finite time. The process thus leads to the formation of stable remnants, whose estimated masses are approximately 20.94$\mu$g, lying in the Planck regime.",
New submissions,Persistence of post-Newtonian structure in binary black hole mergers,Viviana A. CÃ¡ceres-Barbosa,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We analyze the spherical harmonic mode amplitudes of quasi-circular, nonprecessing binary black hole mergers using 283 numerical relativity (NR) simulations from the SXS, RIT, and MAYA catalogs. We construct fits using the leading-order post-Newtonian (PN) dependence on intrinsic parameters, replacing the PN velocity with fit coefficients. We compare these to polynomial fits in symmetric mass ratio and spin. We analyze $(\ell, m)$ modes with $\ell \leq 4$ from late inspiral ($t = -500M$ relative to the $(2,2)$ peak) to post-merger ($t = 40M$). For nonspinning systems, the $(2,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,3)$ modes retain the leading-order PN dependence on mass ratio throughout the merger. Higher-order modes deviate from the PN dependence only near and after the merger, where polynomial fits of degree $N \leq 3$ can capture the amplitude behavior up to $40M$. For aligned-spin systems at fixed mass ratio, the $(2,1)$ mode retains its PN spin dependence, while the $(3,2)$ and $(4,3)$ modes exhibit a quadratic spin dependence near merger. The PN-inspired fits lose accuracy with increasing mass ratio, particularly near merger. Results broadly agree across catalogs, though discrepancies appear in the $(3,1)$, $(4,2)$, and $(4,1)$ modes, likely from resolution differences. Our results clarify the extent to which PN structure persists in mode amplitudes and show that simple polynomial models can capture strong-field behavior near merger, enabling efficient and interpretable waveform modeling in this regime.",
New submissions,Classification of global structures of evaporating regular black holes with infinite periods of time,"Kensuke Sueto,Hirotaka Yoshino",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We carry out model independent analyses for global structures of spherically symmetric regular black holes that evaporate and approach the extremal state spending infinite periods of time due to Hawking radiation.We assume the radius of the outer apparent horizon (outer AH) to be a decreasing function of ingoing null coordinate, and consider the three cases, Cases 1, 2, and 3, where the radius of the inner AH is a constant, increases, and decreases, respectively.A complete classification of the Penrose diagrams is presented in each case, taking account not only of the presence and absence of the event horizon but also of the relative positions of the inner and outer AHs.Sufficient conditions that lead to each type are proved, and the examples of each type are summarized.We also study the behavior of outgoing null geodesics in models where the null geodesic equation is solvable, and figure out the important factors to determine the type of a spacetime using concepts in the area of dynamical systems.The formation of a Cauchy horizon is also established in the solvable models when the event horizon is present.",
New submissions,The impact of plunging matter on black-hole waveform,"Ying-Lei Tian,Hao Yang,Chen Lan,Yan-Gang Miao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we introduce a novel framework to investigate ringdown gravitational waveforms in the presence of dynamical matter fields outside the horizon of a black hole. We systematically analyze two distinct scenarios of dynamical matter fields: motion along geodesics and uniform motion with constant velocity. Our results reveal rich phenomenology in the ringdown gravitational wave signals, including the suppression or enhancement of echoes, frequency shifts in the decay oscillations, and intricate modulations of the power-law tails. Notably, we demonstrate that subluminal moving potentials can produce irregular echo patterns and shift the dominant frequencies, offering potential new observational signatures beyond the already-known ringdown analyses. This study provides a new perspective for probing dynamic environments around black holes and offers a theoretical foundation for interpreting possible deviations in future gravitational wave detections.",
New submissions,Measurement and preparation protocols for quantum field theory on curved spacetimes,Christopher J. Fewster,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this conference proceedings contribution, I describe work in progress concerning two problems in the measurement theory of quantum fields. First, it is proved that all local observables can be obtained from local measurement schemes. Second, I describe a protocol for preparing a Hadamard local product state of given Hadamard states relative to the local algebras of specified spacelike separated regions.",
New submissions,Lensing Stability and Scattering Phenomena in Anisotropic Black Hole Spacetimes in Plasma,"Jonibek Khasanov,Mirzabek Alloqulov,Pankaj Sheoran,Sanjar Shaymatov,Hemwati Nandan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in a plasma environment. Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.",
New submissions,Braneworlds in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,"JosÃ© Euclides G. Silva,Leandro A. Lessa,Roberto V. Maluf",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore the features of a thick braneworld model in five dimensions governed by a Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a non-minimal coupling to a dynamical scalar field. We consider two possible scalar-GB coupling function $\chi(\phi)$, one parity-even and another parity-odd function of the scalar field $\phi$. For both choices, the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet non-minimal coupling produces a warped asymptotically $AdS_5$ spacetime even in the absence of a bulk cosmological constant. Outside the brane core, a negative cosmological constant is bounded by the scalar-GB coupling function. For a thick 3-brane configuration, we found solutions with localized brane energy density and pressure that dynamically produce a bulk cosmological constant. The corresponding scalar field solutions exhibit a non-topological (domain wall) behavior. In order to probe the 3-brane stability solution, we employed a perturbative analysis, by perturbing the thick brane solutions up to first-order. The Kaluza-Klein (KK) tensorial gravitational modes possess a localized massless mode and a tower of non-tachyonic diverging massive modes, what renders the solutions stable at least at the perturbative level.",
New submissions,The effect of the gravitational constant variation on the phase of gravitational waves,"Jiachen An,Bing Sun,Zhoujian Cao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We have previously investigated the effect of the gravitational constant variation on the gravitational wave propagation. Pure theoretical analysis indicates that the leading order effect of the gravitational constant variation corrects the amplitude of gravitational waves, and the second order effect corrects the phase of gravitational waves. As the matched filtering technique is used by gravitational wave data analysis, the phase is more important than the amplitude. In the current paper we use LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA data to constrain the gravitational constant variation. Our findings indicate that we need to wait until the distance of the detected gravitational wave events and/or the signal-to-noise ratio increases by $2n$ orders compared to the current detection state, and then we can use phase correction to get constraint $|\frac{G'}{G}|<10^{-n}$/yr for gravitational wave events without electromagnetic counterparts. For gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts which provide the information of source's luminosity distance, the phase correction can almost always be neglected to constrain $\frac{G'}{G}$.",

Cross submissions,Cosmic Variance in Anisotropy Searches at Pulsar Timing Arrays,"Valerie Domcke,Gabriele Franciolini,Mauro Pieroni",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses show evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) with angular correlations consistent with the Hellings-Downs curve. Anisotropies are a key discriminator of the origin of this GWB, as they are expected to be at 1--20\% for astrophysical sources, but suppressed for cosmological GWBs. However, contrary to gravitational wave detectors at higher frequencies, PTAs only take a few independent measurements of a GWB and consequently are highly sensitive to cosmic variance, which induces apparent anisotropies in individual realizations of an isotropic GWB. We demonstrate explicitly that statistical inference nevertheless remains robust, i.e., measurements are consistent with the underlying assumption of isotropy. This confirms that searches for anisotropies will be able to robustly discriminate astrophysical from cosmological GWBs. En route, we demonstrate that the maximum multipole constrained by a PTA dataset scales linearly with the number of pulsars $\ell_{\rm max} \sim N_p$.",
Cross submissions,Probing the H0 Tension with Holographic Dark Energy in Unimodular Gravity: Insights from DESI DR2,"Francisco Plaza,Gabriel LeÃ³n,Lucila Kraiselburd",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Motivated by the recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI DR2 collaboration, this works presents an extended analysis of a cosmological model based on holographic dark energy within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. We probe the model with an extensive set of observations: cosmic chronometers, Pantheon Plus$+$SH0ES Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO distances, quasar X-ray/UV fluxes (two independent calibrations), and Planck 2018 CMB data. The results are analyzed to assess the modelÅ ability to alleviate the Hubble tension and, in comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, to determine which of the two scenarios is preferred according to Bayesian evidence. We conclude that the present implementation of holographic dark energy in Unimodular Gravity, while theoretically appealing, does not alleviate the Hubble tension and is not statistically preferred by Bayesian criteria when compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, in neither case does the preference become very strong or conclusive against it.",

Cross submissions,Atom Interferometer Phase Shear and Spacetime Sectional Curvature,"Hunter Swan,Jason M. Hogan",Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Atom interferometry is a natural laboratory for precision tests of general relativity, but there is no simple relationship between atom interferometer phase and geometric properties of spacetime. Here we show that a different atom interferometer observable, the phase shear, can be expressed directly as the integrated sectional curvature over a spacetime surface enclosed by the interferometer arms and final beamsplitter. This is a consequence of a generalized Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which also explicitly computes small correction terms arising from gravitational redshift of atom optics pulses. This synthesis of quantum mechanics, relativity, and differential geometry affords a manifestly coordinate-free and representation-free means of measuring spacetime properties. Additionally, it provides a convenient computational tool for predicting atom interferometer properties in arbitrary background spacetimes.",
Cross submissions,Adaptive extended Kalman filter and laser link acquisition in the detection of gravitational waves in space,"Jinke Yang,Yong Xie,Yidi Fan,Pengcheng Wang,Xindong Liang,Haojie Li,Xue Wang,Zhao Cui,Jianjun Jia,Yucheng Tang,Yun Kau Lau",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"An alternative, new laser link acquisition scheme for the triangular constellation of spacecraft (SCs) in deep space in the detection of gravitational waves is considered. In place of a wide field CCD camera in the initial stage of laser link acquisition adopted in the conventional scheme, an extended Kalman filter based on precision orbit determination is incorporated in the point ahead angle mechanism (PAAM) to steer the laser beam in such a way to narrow the uncertainty cone and at the same time avoids the heating problem generated by the CCD camera.A quadrant photodetector (QPD) based on the Differential Power Sensing (DPS) technique, which offers a higher dynamic range than differential wavefront sensing (DWS), is employed as the readout of the laser beam spot. The conventional two stages (coarse acquisition and fine acquisition) are integrated into a single control loop. The payload structure of the ATP control loop is simplified and numerical simulations, based on a colored measurement noise model that closely mimics the prospective on-orbit conditions, demonstrate that the AEKF significantly reduces the initial uncertainty region by predicting the point ahead angle (PAA) even when the worst case scenario in SC position (navigation) error is considered.",
Cross submissions,Refining fundamental constants with white dwarfs: machine learning informed constraints on fine-structure constant and proton-to-electron mass ratio,"Akhil Uniyal(TDLI),Surajit Kalita(Warsaw),Yosuke Mizuno(TDLI),Sayan Chakrabarti(IIT-G),Yan Lu(Shanghai)",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore the potential variation of two fundamental constants, the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\mu$, within the framework of modified gravity theories and finite-temperature effects. Utilising high-precision white dwarf observations from the Gaia-DR3 survey, we construct a robust mass--radius relation using a Bayesian-inspired machine learning framework. This empirical relation is rigorously compared with theoretical predictions derived from scalar-tensor gravity models and temperature-dependent equations of state. Our results demonstrate that both underlying gravitational theory and temperature substantially influence the inferred constraints on $\alpha$ and $\mu$. We obtain the strongest constraints as $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=2.10^{+32.56}_{-39.26}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.61^{+37.16}_{-34.67}\times10^{-7}$ for modified gravity parameter $\gamma\simeq -3.69\times10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$, while for the finite temperature case, these are $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=1.60^{+37.31}_{-35.42}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.23^{+37.02}_{-35.71}\times10^{-7}$ for $T \simeq 1.1 \times 10^7\rm\, K$. These findings yield tighter constraints than those reported in earlier studies and underscore the critical roles of gravitational and thermal physics in testing the constancy of fundamental parameters.",
Cross submissions,Probing Picohertz Gravitational Waves with Pulsars,"Qinyuan Zheng,Chiara M. F. Mingarelli,William DeRocco,Jonathan Nay,Kimberly K. Boddy,Jeff A. Dror",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"With periods much longer than the duration of current pulsar timing surveys, gravitational waves in the picohertz (pHz) regime are not detectable in the typical analysis framework for pulsar timing data. However, signatures of these low-frequency signals persist in the slow variation of pulsar timing parameters. In this work, we present the results of the first Bayesian search for continuous pHz gravitational waves using the drift of two sensitive pulsar timing parameters -- time derivative of pulsar binary orbital period $\dot{P}_b$ and second order time derivative of pulsar spin period $\ddot{P}$. We apply our new technique to a dataset with more than double the number of pulsars as previous searches in this frequency band, achieving an order-of-magnitude sensitivity improvement. No continuous wave signal is detected in current data; however, we show that future observations by the Square Kilometre Array will provide significantly improved sensitivity and the opportunity to observe continuous pHz signals, including the early stages of supermassive black hole mergers. We explore the detection prospects for this signal by extending existing population models into the pHz regime, finding that future observations will probe phenomenologically-interesting parameter space. Our new Bayesian technique and leading sensitivity in this frequency domain paves the way for new discoveries in both black hole astrophysics and the search for new physics in the early universe.",
