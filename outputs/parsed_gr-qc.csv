New submissions,Superradiant amplification by rotating viscous compact objects,"Jaime Redondo-Yuste,Vitor Cardoso",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study fluctuations of rotating viscous stars, using the causal relativistic hydrodynamics of Bemfica, Disconzi, Kovtun, and Noronha. We derive, in a slow-rotation approximation, a coupled system of equations describing the propagation of axial gravitational waves through the star, which couple to internal viscous modes. We show that rotating viscous stars amplify incoming low-frequency gravitational waves, a phenomenon which we argue to be universal. Superradiant amplification does not seem to trigger an instability for uniformly rotating stars, even if the object is compact enough to have light rings.",
New submissions,Testing the Quantum Equivalence Principle with Gravitational Waves,"Saurya Das,Mitja Fridman,Gaetano Lambiase",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study modifications of gravitational wave observables, such as the wave amplitude and frequency, which follow from the quantum equivalence principle, and are expressed in terms of the inertial, gravitational and rest masses of the LIGO/Virgo mirrors. We provide bounds on the violations of the quantum equivalence principle by comparing the results with the most resolved gravitational wave events observed by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The formalism is equally applicable to other future ground and space-based gravitational wave detectors.",
New submissions,Progress toward the detection of the gravitational-wave background from stellar-mass binary black holes: a mock data challenge,"Xiao-Xiao Kou,Muhammed Saleem,Vuk Mandic,Colm Talbot,Eric Thrane",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"While the third LIGO--Virgo gravitational-wave transient catalog includes 90 signals, it is believed that ${\cal O}(10^5)$ binary black holes merge somewhere in the Universe every year. Although these signals are too weak to be detected individually with current observatories, they combine to create a stochastic background, which is potentially detectable in the near future. LIGO--Virgo searches for the gravitational-wave background using cross-correlation have so far yielded upper limits. However, Smith \& Thrane (2017) showed that a vastly more sensitive ``coherent'' search can be carried out by incorporating information about the phase evolution of binary black hole signals. This improved sensitivity comes at a cost; the coherent method is computationally expensive and requires a far more detailed understanding of systematic errors than is required for the cross-correlation search. In this work, we demonstrate the coherent approach with realistic data, paving the way for a gravitational-wave background search with unprecedented sensitivity.",
New submissions,Leading-order gravitational time delay of massive particles by a moving Schwarzschild lens,"Guansheng He,Wenbin Lin,Yi Xie",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The leading-order gravitational time delay of relativistic neutral massive particles (e.g., neutrinos or high-energy cosmic-ray particles) caused by a moving Schwarzschild black hole with a constant radial velocity is investigated for the first time. On the basis of the equations of motion in the spacetime of the moving lens, we achieve a new unified formula for the travel times of relativistic massive and massless particles propagating from the source to the observer within the first post-Minkowskian approximation. The analytical form of the difference between the travel times of a relativistic massive particle and a light signal in this geometry, as well as that of two relativistic massive particles, is thus obtained in the weak-field and slow-motion limit. The influence of the radial lens motion on the leading-order Schwarzschild time delay of relativistic massive particles is then discussed. It is found that in the slow-motion limit, the radial lens motion towards the observer decreases the flight time of an ultrarelativistic massive particle, when compared with the case of no translational motion of the central body. Conversely, if the lens gets away from the detector radially under the same conditions, the propagation process of the particle will slow down and its flight time will thus increase in comparison with the Schwarzschild case. Finally, we analyze the magnitude of the full radial motion effect of the lens and evaluate the possibility of its astronomical detection by modeling three typical black holes as the lens respectively.",
New submissions,Anomaly freedom in effective Loop Quantum Cosmology refined: extended functional dependence of the counter-terms,"Maxime De Sousa,Aurélien Barrau,Killian Martineau",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Instead of assuming that they depend only on the background variables, we investigate the hypothesis that counter-terms appearing in the deformed algebra approach to loop quantum cosmology depend on the full phase-space variables. We derive the associated anomalies and solve the entire system in several specific cases. New restrictions on the generalized holonomy corrections are obtained.",
New submissions,"On Geometrization of Classical Fields II (MES: dark matter, energy)",V. I. Noskov,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The study ofarXiv:2502.01174geometrization of classical fields in the 4d--Finsler space of MES (Model of Embedded Spaces) is continued. The model postulates a proper metric set of a distributed matter element and states that the space-time of the Universe is a physical Embedding of such sets. The Embedding geometry is a Finsler-like relativistic geometry with connectivity depending on the mechanical state of matter: torsion and non-metricity are absent. The Least Action Principle provides the geodesic motion of matter, leads to nonlinearity of the system of field equations, anisotropy and Weyl-invariance of gravitation MES. It is shown that in the special case of Embedding (conformal Weyl metric) the geometrization of fields can be realized completely: namely, to obtain Maxwell-type equations and to find the gravitational sources, lying behind the $\Lambda$ term of Einstein-type equation. They are identified as dark matter and energy of the Universe, and the estimates of their material-field composition are close to the observed ones. It is also shown that the Embedding's gravitational and electromagnetic potentials are mutual gauge fields. Further development of the MES implies going beyond the Weyl metric.",
New submissions,Topological Stars and scalar wave equation: Exact resummation of the renormalized angular momentum in the eikonal limit,"Donato Bini,Giorgio Di Russo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We show that for a Topological Star the renormalized angular momentum parameter, $\nu$, appearing in the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi-type or in the quantum-Seiberg-Witten-type approaches of the perturbation equations, has 1) a direct link with the geodesic radial action computed along the null orbits of the background and 2) admits an exact resummation in terms of hypergeometric functions, generalizing previous results valid in the Schwarzschild case, see Ref.[arXiv:2504.07862[hep-th]].",
New submissions,Perihelion precession of planetary orbits solved from quantum field theory,"Mikko Partanen,Jukka Tulkki",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We derive the perihelion precession of planetary orbits using quantum field theory extending the Standard Model to include gravity. Modeling the gravitational bound state of an electron via the Dirac equation of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)], and taking the classical planetary state limit, we obtain orbital dynamics exhibiting a precession in agreement with general relativity. This demonstrates that key general relativistic effects in planetary motion can emerge directly from quantum field theory without invoking the geometric framework of general relativity.",
New submissions,Clarifying the relation between covariantly conserved currents and Noether's theorem,"Nuno Barros e Sá,Miguel A. S. Pinto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"On one hand, proper conservation laws, that is, the existence of local functions of the fields whose divergence vanishes on-shell, are associated with global symmetries and are a consequence of Noether's first theorem. On the other hand, covariant conservation laws, i.e., the same type of laws but featuring a covariant divergence, are associated with local symmetries and are a consequence (under certain conditions) of Noether's second theorem. In this paper, we clarify under which conditions Noether's second theorem, which is mostly known for providing relations between the equations of motion of a theory that possesses some local symmetries, can be used to generate covariantly conservation laws. We also investigate the relation between the conserved current of a theory with global symmetry and the covariantly conserved current of the corresponding local symmetry. We treat these issues using only the tools of Calculus, in the fashion of Noether's original article, avoiding the somewhat complicated mathematical tools that plague much of the literature on this topic, thus making the article readable for the general physicist.",
New submissions,The AdS Perspective on the Nonlinear Tails in Black Hole Ringdown,"Alex Kehagias,Antonio Riotto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Black holes gradually settle into their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, whose amplitude diminish over time according to a power-law decay at fixed spatial locations. We show that the nonlinear tails in the presence of a quadratic source, which have been recently found to potentially dominate over the linear ones, can be simply derived from the AdS$_2$$\times$S$^2$ spacetime perspective with their amplitudes being related to the Aretakis constants.",
New submissions,Complete quasinormal modes of Type-D black holes,"Changkai Chen,Jiliang Jing,Zhoujian Cao,Mengjie Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra of black holes exhibit two open problems [Conf. Proc. C 0405132, 145 (2004); CQG 26, 163001 (2009)]: (i) the discontinuity in highly damped QNMs between Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions as $a \to 0$, and (ii) the unexplained spectral proximity between QNMs and algebraically special (AS) frequencies, particularly the anomalous multiplet splitting for Kerr $\ell=2$, $m \geq 0$ modes. We develop a novel method to compute complete QNM spectra for Type-D black holes, solving both problems and establishing a mathematical framework for boundary value problems of dissipative systems. Using analytic continuation of radial eigenvalue equations, our method eliminates the dependence on auxiliary parameters in the connection formulas for confluent Heun solutions. This breakthrough overcomes the long-standing challenge of calculating QNMs that cross or lie on the negative imaginary axis (NIA).For Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes ($0 \leq n \leq 41$, $2 \leq \ell \leq 16$), we present complete spectra validated through scattering amplitudes with errors $<10^{-10}$.The results provide definitive solutions to both open problems: (i) The inability of conventional methods to compute QNMs crossing or residing on the NIA leads to apparent discontinuities in Kerr spectra as $a \to 0$. (ii) When a QNM exactly coincides with the AS frequency, an additional QNM (unconventional mode) appearsthis http URLthe Kerr case with $\ell=2$, overtone sequences from both unconventional and AS modes exhibit precisely $2\ell+1$ branches, without multiplets or supersymmetry breaking at ASthis http URLmethod confirms Leung's conjecture of high-$\ell$ unconventional mode deviations from the NIA through the first $\ell=3$this http URL, this paradigm surpasses the state-of-the-art Cook's continued fraction and isomonodromic methods in computational efficiency.",
New submissions,Probing quadratic gravity with black-hole ringdown gravitational waves measured by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors,"Adrian Ka-Wai Chung,Nicolás Yunes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Quadratic gravity theories emerge as the low-energy limit of many grand-unified and quantum-gravity theories. We report the first gravitational-wave ringdown constraints on such theories obtained purely from the quasinormal-mode spectra of rapidly-spinning black-hole remnants. We find no quadratic-gravity signatures from ringdown signals measured by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, thereby constraining the coupling length scale of axi-dilaton gravity below 34 km, dynamical Chern-Simons gravity below 49 km, and scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity below 47 km.",
New submissions,Gravitational-wave background detection using machine learning,"Hugo Einsle,Marie-Anne Bizouard,Tania Regimbau,Mairi Sakellariadou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Extracting the faint gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal from dominant detector noise and disentangling its %diverse astrophysical and cosmological components remain significant challenges for traditional methods like cross-correlation analysis. We propose a novel hybrid approach that combines deep learning with Bayesian inference to identify and characterize the GWB more rapidly than current techniques. Our method utilizes a custom-designed multi-scale multi-headed autoencoder (MSMHAutoencoder) architecture to separate GWB signals from detector noise, and subsequently Marcov Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation to disentangle the GWB components. Using simulated data representative of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network at design sensitivity, we show that our MSMHAutoencoder can detect with high confidence (log noise Bayes factor of 3) a GWB from binary black hole mergers with fractional energy density $\Omega_{\text{BBH}} \approx 10^{-9}$ at 25 Hz. In the presence of such an astrophysical GWB, we can simultaneously measure a cosmological component as faint as $\Omega_{\text{Cosmo}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-10}$ using 47.4 days of training data.",
Cross submissions,Gravity versus astrophysics in black hole images and photon rings: equatorial emissions and spherically symmetric spacetimes,"I. Urso,F. H. Vincent,M. Wielgus,T. Paumard,G. Perrin",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The EHT collaboration released in 2019 the first horizon-scale images of a black hole accretion flow, opening a novel route for plasma physics comprehension and gravitational tests. Although the present unresolved images deeply depend on the astrophysical properties of the accreted matter, GR predicts that they contain highly lensed observables, the ""photon rings"", embodying the effects of strong-field gravity. Focusing on the supermassive black hole M87* and adopting a geometrically thin, equatorial disc as a phenomenological configuration for the accreting matter, our goal is to study the degeneracy of spacetime curvature and of physically-motivated emission processes on EHT-like images observed at 230 and 345 GHz. In a parametric framework, we simulate adaptively ray-traced images using GYOTO in various spherically-symmetric spacetime geometries, for a comprehensive class of disc velocities and realistic synchrotron emission profiles. We then extract the width and the peak position of 1D intensity cross sections on the direct image and the first photon ring. We show that, among the investigated quantities, the most appropriate observables to probe the geometry are the peak positions of the first photon ring. Small geometric deviations can be unequivocally detected, regardless of the motion of the disc, ranging from a Keplerian to a radially infalling one, if the black hole mass-to-distance estimate is accurate up to around 2%; the current uncertainty of 11% being sufficient just to access extreme deviations. The equatorial set-up of this paper, favoured by present EHT observations of M87*, is adapted to model future measurements at higher observing frequencies, where absorption effects are negligible, and with higher resolution, indispensable to resolve the photon rings. Additional work is needed to investigate if our conclusions hold for more realistic disc configurations.",
Cross submissions,Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration from QCD Confinement Dynamics,"Jonathan Rincón,Humberto Martínez-Huerta,Adolfo Huet,Alberto Hernández-Almada,Miguel A. García-Aspeitia",General Physics (physics.gen-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We explore a phenomenological extension of the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model by introducing a coupling between the Polyakov loop potential and the Hubble parameter $H(t)$, inspired by the hypothesis that the QCD vacuum, particularly in the confined phase, may be sensitive to the large-scale dynamics of the universe. The coupling term, proportional to $(H(t)/H_0)^d f(\Phi)$, vanishes in the deconfined regime and acts as a dynamical dark energy contribution at late times, without invoking a fundamental cosmological constant. This framework maintains the thermodynamic consistency of the PNJL model and introduces a minimal modification to the effective potential, controlled by a single exponent $d$. We confront the model with low-redshift cosmological data, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, HII galaxies, and quasars. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo analysis, we derive constraints on the model parameters and compare its performance with LambdaCDM. Our results show that the modified PNJL cosmology provides a statistically competitive fit to current data within 68% C.L.; while offering a theoretically motivated alternative to standard dark energy scenarios. We discuss the implications for QCD in curved spacetime and suggest avenues for further theoretical and observational investigation.",
Cross submissions,"The fast, the slow and the merging: probes of evaporating memory burdened PBHs","Alessandro Dondarini,Giulio Marino,Paolo Panci,Michael Zantedeschi",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The so-called memory-burden effect implies that evaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) inevitably stabilize before complete decay. This stabilization opens a new mass window for PBH Dark Matter below $10^{15}\,$g. The transition to the memory-burdened phase is not instantaneous but unfolds over cosmological timescales, with some PBHs entering this phase in the present epoch. Additionally, a fraction of PBHs undergo mergers today, forming ''young'' semiclassical black holes that evaporate at unsuppressed rates. Both processes generate fluxes of stable astrophysical particles, which are constrained by current measurements of high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos. Moreover, the steep increase in energy injection at higher redshifts perturbs the ionization history of the Universe, leading to complementary bounds from observations of the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. We find that the reopened window enabled by the memory-burden effect is largely within reach of detection, both locally and across cosmological distances. We further describe how our findings restrict the values of the critical exponent characterizing the memory burden phenomenon.",
Cross submissions,Beyond diagonal approximations: improved covariance modeling for pulsar timing array data analysis,"Marco Crisostomi,Rutger van Haasteren,Patrick M. Meyers,Michele Vallisneri",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for nHz gravitational-wave backgrounds (GWBs) typically model time-correlated noise by assuming a diagonal covariance in Fourier space, neglecting inter-frequency correlations introduced by the finite observation window. We show that this diagonal approximation can lead to biased estimates of spectral parameters, especially for the common red process that represents the GWB. To address these limitations, we present a method that (i) computes the time-domain autocorrelation on a coarse grid using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), (ii) interpolates it accurately to the unevenly sampled observation times, and (iii) incorporates it into a low-rank likelihood via the Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury identity. Using both analytic covariance comparisons and end-to-end simulations inspired by the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we demonstrate that our method captures frequency correlations faithfully, avoids Gibbs ringing, and recovers unbiased spectral parameters with modest computational cost. As PTA datasets increase in sensitivity and complexity, our approach offers a practical and scalable path to fully accurate covariance modeling for current and future analyses.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational wave imprints on spontaneous emission,"Jerzy Paczos,Navdeep Arya,Sofia Qvarfort,Daniel Braun,Magdalena Zych",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Despite growing interest, there is a scarcity of known predictions in the regime where both quantum and relativistic effects become observable. Here, we investigate a combined atom-field system in a curved spacetime, focusing specifically on gravitational-wave backgrounds. We show that a plane gravitational wave modifies spontaneous emission from a single atom, both in terms of sidebands in the spectrum and directionality of the emission. While the total decay rate remains unchanged, implying that no information about the gravitational wave is stored in the atomic internal state alone, the wave leaves imprints on the evolution of the composite atom-field system. To quantify how well this effect can be measured, we analyze both the classical Fisher information associated with photon number measurements and the quantum Fisher information. Our analysis indicates that the effect could be measured in state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments and points to spontaneous emission as a potential probe of low-frequency gravitational waves.",
Cross submissions,Decorating Asymptotically Flat Space-Time with the Moduli Space of String Theory,Ashoke Sen,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"N=2, 4 and 8 supersymmetric string theories in four dimensional flat space-time have moduli space of vacua. We argue that starting from a theory where the moduli approach a particular moduli space point A at infinity, we can construct a classical solution that contains an arbitrarily large space-time region where the moduli take values corresponding to any other moduli space point B of our choice to any desired accuracy. Therefore the observables of a theory with a given set of asymptotic values of the moduli will have complete information on the observables for any other asymptotic values of the moduli. Also it is physically impossible for any experiment, performed over a finite time, to determine the asymptotic values of the moduli. We point out the difference between asymptotically flat space-time and asymptotically AdS space-time in this regard and discuss the possible implication of these results for holographic duals of string theories in flat space-time. For N=2 supersymmetric theories, A and B could correspond to compactifications on topologically distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds related by flop or conifold transitions.",
Cross submissions,Quantum detection of boundary conditions,"Jefferson Monção da Silva,João Paulo M. Pitelli",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The quantum detection of spacetime conicity was investigated in reference [Phys. Lett. B 820, 136482 (2021)] through the analysis of the response function of an Unruh-deWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field. In particular, it was shown that the detector can discern the presence of the deficit angle of a region of spacetime even when it is placed on a flat region with no conical deficit and (due to the rapid switching on and off) is classically isolated from the conical region. The scalar field was supposed to be continuous at the three dimensional timelike hypersurface connecting both regions and it was argued that the non-trivial effects on the response function were only due to the deficit angle of the outer conical region. In this paper, we study the response function of the Unruh-deWitt detector on the same classical framework, but exploring the effects of the choice of boundary conditions for the scalar field at the connecting hypersurface. These boundary conditions are extracted from the two-interval Sturm-Liouville theory and each one gives rise to a physically inequivalent sensible dynamics for the quantum field. We show that they play an important role on the response function of the detector, which effectively ``feels'' the combined effect of conicity + boundary condition.",
Cross submissions,On-shell Lagrangians as total derivatives and the generalized Komar charge,"José Luis V. Cerdeira,Tomás Ortín",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Lagrangians which transform homogeneously under a global transformation of the fields (a global rescaling, for instance) can be written on-shell as a total derivative which has a universal, solution-independent expression, using a functional version of the Euler theorem for homogeneous functions. We study the uniqueness of this expression and how this result can be used in the construction of generalized Komar charges.",
Cross submissions,DESI results and Dark Energy from QCD topological sectors,"Ludovic Van Waerbeke,Ariel Zhitnitsky",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We present a physically motivated model of dark energy (DE) rooted in the topological structure of the Quantum ChromoDynamic (QCD) vacuum. In this framework, DE emerges as the Universe expands, from the difference in vacuum energy between the expanding Universe and Minkowski spacetime, driven by QCD vacuum topological sectors. This leads to a modification of the dark energy term in the Friedmann equation, which then scales with the Hubble parameter as $\rho_{\rm DE}(t) \propto H(t)$ when dark energy dominates the expansion of the Universe. The QCD scale, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD} \sim 100~{\rm MeV}$, naturally sets the energy density of DE and provides a compelling explanation for why its impact on cosmic expansion becomes significant only in the recent cosmological epoch. Importantly, the entire framework is grounded in Standard Model (SM) physics, involving no new fields or coupling constants. Key predictions of the model include: (a) A present-day DE equation of state $w_{\rm DE} > -1$, asymptotically approaching the de Sitter limit $w_{\rm DE} = -1$ in the future, with the corresponding asymptotic Hubble constant $\overline{H}$ set by $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. (b) At redshifts $z \ge 0$, $w_{\rm DE}$ can lie above or below $-1$ and may cross this boundary multiple times, behavior qualitatively consistent with recent DESI observations. (c) The solution to the Friedmann equation in this framework can deviate from the canonical $\Lambda$CDM form at $z \ge 0$. (d) If such deviation occurs, it can be tested using cosmological observations, CMB anisotropies, BAO, SNIa, and large-scale structure, which we propose to explore in future work. (e) Finally, we point out a potential connection between our framework and the observed $H_0$ tension.",
Cross submissions,Enhancing photon-axion conversion probability with squeezed coherent states,"Taiki Ikeda,Sugumi Kanno,Jiro Soda",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states with N photons added can significantly enhance the conversion probability.",
Cross submissions,The power of SKA to Constrain cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds below the astrophysical foreground noise,"Chengjie Fu,Jing Liu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The inspirals of supermaissive black hole binaries provide a convinced gravitational wave background in the nHz band, serving as the fiducial model of the recent gravitational wave signal reported by the PTA experiments. The uncertainties of the number of binaries contributing to each frequency bin introduce a foreground noise in the nHz and $\mu$Hz bands against the observation of the underlying gravitational wave backgrounds of the cosmological origin. In this work, we investigate a new method to constrain the cosmological gravitational wave strength under the astrophysical foreground. The energy density fluctuations from cosmological gravitational-wave sources can generally trigger the formation of compact subhalos of dark matter, and the upcoming Square Kilometer Array has the ability to constrain the abundance of the subhalos at the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ level. The cosmological gravitational wave energy spectra from various sources are expected to be constrained several orders of magnitude below the astrophysical foreground, providing more strict constraints on the parameter spaces of corresponding new physics models.",
Cross submissions,Spinning the Probe in Kerr with WQFT,"Jitze Hoogeveen,Gustav Uhre Jakobsen,Jan Plefka",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the gravitational scattering of a spinning probe mass in a Kerr background using the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) approach. This corresponds to the leading term (0SF) in the gravitational self-force expansion for the spinning two-body problem with large mass hierarchy. By reformulating the geodesic and Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations as a recursive Berends-Giele type equation known from multi-gluon scattering, we develop a novel integration-by-parts formalism on the worldline that enables systematic computation of scattering observables - specifically the impulse and spin kick - to arbitrary orders in Newton's constant and spin. Here, the transition to a position space formalism is key. We present explicit results up to and including the physical 7PM order, thereby incorporating all relevant higher-spin and higher-curvature terms on the worldline, advancing beyond previous calculations. This work represents an initial step to reconceptualise the gravitational self-force expansion through worldline quantum field theory.",
Cross submissions,Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture,Samuel Fedida,Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of spacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein causality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a generalisation to Lüders' rule à la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture à la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.",
Cross submissions,Relativistic implications of entropy and purity,"Joseph Balsells,Martin Bojowald",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"A quantum object is extended by virtue of quantum uncertainty. Subjected to gravity, it therefore experiences tidal forces and other relativistic effects. As a result, entropy and purity affect geodesic motion and acquire weight, an observation that has broad implications from free-fall experiments to Hawking radiation. If the object's position is quantum correlated in at least two directions, a complete description of its geodesic motion requires non-Riemannian geometry of a form controlled by the entropy and purity of its state. In addition, the analysis reveals a new Minkowski structure on a subspace of entanglement degrees of freedom.",
