New submissions,Quantum Gravity and Entanglement in Particle Physics and Gravitation,Nick E. Mavromatos,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Some approaches to Quantum Gravity (QG) entail decoherence of quantum matter propagating in it, due to an ``environment'' of QG degrees of freedom inaccessible to low-energy observers. In the first part of this talk, I discuss potential, and rather unique, effects of QG-induced decoherence on entangled particle states, specifically an induced modification of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations of entangled neutral-meson states in meson factories ($\omega$-effect). In the second part, I summarise a recent work in which axion-like fields, forming a kind of condensate clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) astrophysical black holes, can lead to superradiant instabilities, and, through these, to the production of EPR-like entangled states of gravitons, with the entanglement pertaining to (left, right) polarisation degrees of freedom. In the presence of axions and Kerr geometries, there are non-trivial gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS)-type anomalous terms in the respective low-energy gravitational effective actions. Depending on whether the graviton entanglement is due to the non-anomalous terms (of General-Relativity type) in the effective action, or to the gCS terms, one obtains different structures of the resulting entangled squeezed-graviton states, which resemble somewhat the $\omega$-effect.",
New submissions,Self-Gravity in Superradiance Clouds: Implications for Binary Dynamics and Observational Prospects,"Hyungjin Kim,Alessandro Lenoci",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole, introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings, especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through gravitational wave observations.",
New submissions,Horizon tracking for asynchronous parallel black hole simulations,"Kyle C. Nelli,William Throwe,Nils Deppe,Mark A. Scheel,Lawrence E. Kidder,Nils L. Vu,Saul A. Teukolsky",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In the field of gravitational wave science, next-generation detectors will be substantially more accurate than the current suite of detectors. Numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole (BBH) gravitational waveforms must become faster, more efficient, and more accurate to be used in analyses of these next-generation detections. One approach, which the \texttt{SpECTRE} code employs, is using spectral methods for accuracy along with synchronous task-based parallelism to avoid idle time in simulations and make the most efficient use of computational resources. When writing an asynchronous application, algorithms must be redesigned compared to their synchronous counterparts. To illustrate this process, we present novel methods for dynamically tracking the apparent horizons in evolutions of BBH mergers using a feedback control system, all in the context of asynchronous parallelism. We also briefly detail how these methods can be applied to binary neutron star simulations performed with asynchronous parallelism.",
New submissions,"Toward Low-Latency, High-Fidelity Calibration of the LIGO Detectors with Enhanced Monitoring Tools","M. Wade,J. Betzwieser,D. Bhattacharjee,L. Dartez,E. Goetz,J. Kissel,L. Sun,A. Viets,M. Carney,E. Makelele,L. Wade",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"Accurate and reliable calibration of the Advanced LIGO detectors has enabled a plethora of gravitational-wave discoveries over the past decade, starting with the ground-breaking discovery, GW150914. Over the past ten years, the calibrated strain data from Advanced LIGO detectors has become available at a lower latency and with more reliability. In this paper, we discuss the relevant history of Advanced LIGO calibration and introduce new tools that have been developed to enable faster and more robust calibrated strain data products in the current observing run. We discuss improvements to the robustness, reliability, and accuracy of the low-latency calibration pipeline as well as the development of a new tool for monitoring the LIGO calibration in real time.",
New submissions,A general Fourier expansion of post-Newtonian binary dynamics based on quasi-Keplerian framework,"Xiaolin Liu,Zhoujian Cao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We have introduced a new Fourier-expansion technique for computing gravitational-wave emission from non-spinning binaries in the post-Newtonian framework. Using this approach, we derived the full set of 3PN dynamical quantities and gravitational-wave Fourier modes and have released the corresponding numerical code as open source. Furthermore, applying the method to the tail contribution of the energy flux, we found that it can be resummed into an exceptionally compact expression. These advances pave the way for more convenient and accurate frequency-domain waveform modeling in the future.",
New submissions,Velocity rotation curves in the gravimagnetic dipole spacetime,"Clémentine Dassy,Jan Govaerts",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The gravimagnetic dipole spacetime consists of two counter-rotating black holes of equal mass connected by a Misner string. For a particular distance in between them, the string is tensionless with the black holes at equilibrium with each other.The geodesics of relativistic massive, or massless particles are considered, leading to the identification of circular rotation trajectories. The velocities of these trajectories are computed.",
New submissions,On quantum creation of a toroidal universe,"Alan H. Guth,Alexander Vilenkin",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider the quantum creation of a universe with flat spatial sections and the topology of a 3-torus, taking into account the effect of Casimir energy. We show that the corresponding instantons are singular. Since these instantons describe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that they cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum corrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the toroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic identifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime is geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical universe originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude that the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be described in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either impossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics. We therefore see no reasonable way to compare the probability of creation of a toroidal universe, if it is possible at all, with that of a spherical universe.",
New submissions,Challenging a binary neutron star merger interpretation of GW230529,"Ivan Markin,Anna Puecher,Mattia Bulla,Tim Dietrich",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"GW230529_181500 represented the first gravitational-wave detection with one of the component objects' mass inferred to lie in the previously hypothesized mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest observed black holes. Given the expected maximum mass values for neutron stars, this object was identified as a black hole, and, with the secondary component being a neutron star, the detection was classified as a neutron star-black hole merger. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy between the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models, GW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\gtrsim 2 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) neutron stars with high spins. We investigate the distinguishability of these scenarios by performing parameter estimation on simulated signals obtained from numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron star-black hole and binary neutron star systems, with parameters consistent with GW230529_181500, and comparing them to the analysis of the real event data. We find that GW230529_181500 is more likely to have originated from a neutron star-black hole merger, though the possibility of a binary neutron star origin can not be ruled out. Moreover, we use the simulation data to estimate the signatures of potential electromagnetic counterparts emitted by the systems. We find them to be too dim to be located by current wide-field surveys if only the dynamical ejecta is considered, and detectable by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory during the first two days after merger if one accounts for additional disk wind ejecta.",
New submissions,Estimating High-Order Time Derivatives of Kerr Orbital Functionals,"Lennox S. Keeble,Alejandro Cárdenas-Avendaño",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Functions of bound Kerr geodesic motion play a central role in many calculations in relativistic astrophysics, ranging from gravitational-wave generation to self-force and radiation-reaction modeling. Although these functions can be expressed as a Fourier series using the geodesic fundamental frequencies, reconstructing them in coordinate time is challenging due to the coupling of the radial and polar motions. In this paper, we compare two strategies for performing such reconstructions and their ability to estimate high-order coordinate-time derivatives of the orbital functional. The first method maps Fourier coefficients from Mino to coordinate time; the second method fits a sampled time series of the function to a truncated coordinate-time Fourier series. While the latter method is prone to overfitting, it yields more accurate reconstructions and derivatives than the mapping, but completely misrepresents the harmonic content of the orbital functional. For the purpose of accurate coordinate-time derivative estimation, we propose a hybrid method: fit for the Mino-time coefficients, differentiate with respect to Mino time, then convert to coordinate time. Applied to the mass quadrupole of a generic Kerr geodesic, this hybrid method recovers the sixth derivative with a fractional residual $\sim10^{-6}$ using only two harmonics. For orbital functionals that depend explicitly on the geodesic orbit expressed in Boyer--Lindquist coordinates, we also provide a recursive procedure for computing coordinate-time derivatives using exact analytic expressions. These results offer a general framework for accurately evaluating high-order time derivatives along Kerr geodesic worldlines, with direct relevance to applications such as extreme-mass-ratio inspiral kludge waveform modeling, where such derivatives are key ingredients for precise gravitational-wave predictions.",
New submissions,Optical Phenomena in a Non-Commutative Kalb-Ramond Black Hole Spacetime,"A. A. Araújo Filho,N. Heidari,Iarley P. Lobo,Yuxuan Shi",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"This work investigates additional gravitational features of a newly proposed black hole spacetime within Kalb-Ramond gravity, incorporating non-commutative corrections arising from a gauge-theoretic approach recently introduced in the literature [arXiv:2507.17390]. Accordingly, null geodesics are solved numerically to trace photon paths; the photon sphere and shadow are determined. From Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements of $Sgr A^{*}$, constraints on the parameters $\Theta$ (which encapsulates the non-commutativity) and $\ell$ (the Lorentz-violating parameter) are established. To examine the stability of critical orbits and the deflection angle (gravitational lensing) in the weak field scenario, we compute the Gaussian curvature in order to use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Moreover, the deflection angle has been calculated as well in the strong deflection limit. Furthermore, Lensing observables are estimated using EHT data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87$. Topological features such as the topological photon sphere are also explored.",
New submissions,Inflation in $F(R)$ gravity models revisited after ACT,"Sergei V. Ketov,Ekaterina O. Pozdeeva,Sergey Yu. Vernov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The $F(R)$ gravity models of inflation are revisited in light of the recent observations of cosmic microwave background radiation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and DESI Collaboration. A detailed study of the evolution equations in the Jordan frame is given and a new description of the slow-roll approximation in the $F(R)$-gravity-based models of inflation is proposed. It is found that all those models of inflation are significantly constrained by demanding a higher (than the Planck Telescope value) cosmological tilt $n_s$ of scalar perturbations and a positive running index $\alpha_s$ favored by ACT. It is not difficult to meet the ACT constraints on the scalar tilt $n_s$ by modifying the existing models of inflation, but simultaneously demanding a positive running $\alpha_s$ would rule out many of them. Using the proposed slow-roll approximation in the Jordan frame, we provide a new modification of the Starobinsky inflation model in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity, which satisfies all ACT constraints.",
New submissions,Spontaneous charge separation in accelerating relativistic plasmas,Lorenzo Gavassino,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The Stewart-Tolman effect posits that accelerating conductors exhibit both charge separation and rest-frame electric fields (``inertia of charge''), while the Ehrenfest-Tolman effect states that acceleration induces temperature gradients (``inertia of heat''). We study the interplay of these effects in thermodynamic equilibrium. Specifically, we derive from first principles a partial differential equation governing the electrothermal stratification of a fully ionized plasma in equilibrium under irrotational relativistic accelerations in curved spacetime. We then solve it in two settings: a plasma enclosed in a uniformly accelerated box, and a plasma shell suspended above a black hole horizon. The resulting electric fields are found not to depend on the electric conductivity of the medium.",
New submissions,The Realization of 3D Topological Spaces Branched Over Graphs,Christopher L Duston,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"In this paper we present an implementation of a computer algorithm that automatically determines the topological structure of spacetime, using a branched covering space representation. This algorithm is applied to a few simple examples in dimension 3, and a complete set of the topological spaces branched over several graphs are found. We also include some new visualizations of the branched covering construction, in order to aid and clarify the understanding of how these structures can be used in quantum gravity to realize the topological nature of the spacetime foam.",
New submissions,Comments on the Hyperboloidal Foliation for Black Hole Quasinormal Modes,"Wei-Liang Qian,Guan-Ru Li,Xiao-Mei Kuang,Ramin G. Daghigh,Jodin C. Morey,Michael D. Green,Rui-Hong Yue",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this brief note, we demonstrate that the hyperboloidal foliation technique, applied to the study of black hole quasinormal modes, where the spatial boundary is shifted from spacelike infinity to the future event horizon and null infinity, is effectively equivalent to the conventional approach, in which the asymptotic wave function typically diverges at both ends of spatial infinity. Specifically, although perhaps counterintuitive, a given hyperboloidal slicing, corresponding to a particular choice of coordinates, always uniquely determines a scheme for extracting the wave function, dictated by the asymptotic behavior of the master equation at the spatial boundary. It follows that the efficiency and precision observed in evaluating the quasinormal modes should be attributed primarily to other factors, such as the use of Chebyshev grids.",
New submissions,Charged Proca Stars,"Yahir Mio,Miguel Alcubierre",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider self-gravitating stationary configurations of a charged massive complex Proca field, also known as charged Proca stars, in the particular case of spherical symmetry. We first present a general 3+1 decomposition of the Einstein--Maxwell--Proca system, starting from the action and field equations. We then restrict our system to the case of spherical symmetry and, after imposing a harmonic time dependence ansatz for the Proca field, we construct families of charged Proca stars for different values of the charge parameter $q$, and different values of the central Proca scalar potential $\varphi$. In a similar way to the case of scalar boson stars, one can define a critical charge $q=q_c$ that corresponds to the value for which the Coulomb repulsion of the charged Proca field exactly cancels their newtonian gravitational attraction. We find that supercritical solutions can exist for a limited range of charges above the critical value $q>q_c$. We also consider the binding energy $E_B$ for the different families of solutions, and find that gravitationally bound solutions such that $E_B<0$ can only exist for subcritical charges such that $q<q_c$, indicating that our supercritical solutions are probably dynamically unstable against perturbations.",
Cross submissions,Modeling Non-Gaussianities in Pulsar Timing Array data analysis using Gaussian Mixture Models,"Mikel Falxa,Alberto Sesana",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, noise is typically assumed to be Gaussian, and the marginalized likelihood has a well-established analytical form derived within the framework of Gaussian processes. However, this Gaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and cosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features in PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or signal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this approach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully analytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This makes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis tools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by producing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred from the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We validate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to non-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function of the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically motivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB and show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual source. Finally, we test our model on a realistic GWB generated from a simulated population of SMBHBs.",
Cross submissions,Oscillations and parity violation in gravitational wave background from extra tensor modes,"Jaume Garriga,Mohammad Ali Gorji,Fazlollah Hajkarim,Misao Sasaki",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Spectator fields which provide additional tensor degrees of freedom, on top of the standard metric tensor perturbations, can produce significant amounts of gravitational waves (GWs). Employing the effective field theory approach for spin-2 fields, we find a universal prediction that linear mixing between the metric and extra tensor modes inevitably induces oscillatory features in the GW spectrum, reminiscent of the so-called neutrino oscillation. Moreover, parity-violating operators in the spin-2 sector can imprint chiral signatures on the resulting GW background. We consider a concrete scenario in which the spin-2 field generates observable chiral GWs with characteristic oscillatory patterns. These results provide a model-independent characterization of the key signatures and observational implications of such scenarios which can be detected with future GW detectors.",
Cross submissions,Particle physics models of interacting bosonic dark energy and fermionic dark matter in Einstein scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity,"Simran Arora,Saddam Hussain,Benjamin Rose,Anzhong Wang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We explore a cosmological framework in which a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field, acting as dark energy, interacts with a fermionic dark matter field through a coupling obtained from the point of view of particle physics. This setup is inspired by string/M-theory, and two representative scalar field potentials are investigated: exponential and power-law. A distinctive feature of the GB-coupled models is their potential to alter the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs), a property with significant implications in light of recent multi-messenger astrophysical observations. To account for this, we analyze models under two scenarios: one where the GW speed differs from that of light and the other where they are equal, but all consistent with current observational constraints. The dynamical evolution of the system is investigated by reformulating the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system, enabling a detailed analysis of the Universe's long-term behavior, including the radiation-, matter- and dark energy-dominated epochs. We constrain the model parameters using a broad set of recent observational data, including mock high-redshift measurements from the Roman Space Telescope. Our findings indicate that both potentials yield cosmologies that are in excellent agreement with current data, closely tracking the expansion history predicted by the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model, while still allowing room for subtle deviations that could be tested by future observations.",
Cross submissions,Embedding Signature-Changing Manifolds: A Braneworld and Kaluza-Klein Perspective,N. E. Rieger,Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We investigate a class of semi-Riemannian manifolds characterized by smooth metric signature changes with a transverse radical, This class includes spacetimes relevant to cosmological models such as the Hartle-Hawking ""no boundary"" proposal \cite{Hartle Hawking -- Wave function of the Universe}, where a Riemannian manifold transitions smoothly into a Lorentzian spacetime without boundaries or singularities. For this class, we prove the existence of global isometric embeddings into higher-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces. We then strengthen this result by demonstrating that a specific type of global isometric embedding, which we term an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding, also exists into both Minkowski space and Misner space. For the canonical $n$-dimensional signature-changing model, we explicitly construct a full global isometric embedding into $(n+1)$-dimensional Minkowski and Misner spaces, a significantly stronger result than an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding for this specific case. This embedding framework provides new geometric tools for studying signature change and braneworlds through the geometry of submanifolds embedded in a bulk, thus presenting a mathematically well-defined approach to these phenomena.",
Cross submissions,Spacetime Curvature as a Probe of Exotic Core Phases in Neutron Stars within Modified Gravity,"Sayantan Ghosh,Bharat Kumar,Subhash Mahapatra",Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this study, we investigate the effect of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) on the curvature of neutron stars (NSs) by using three relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs) and three hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) EOSs. Neutron stars, with their extreme densities and strong gravitational fields, provide an ideal laboratory for testing General Relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime and for exploring possible deviations via modified gravity. EMSG extends GR by including nonlinear terms involving the energy-momentum tensor, characterized by a coupling parameter $\alpha$. We focus on the Kretschmann, Ricci, and Weyl curvature scalars, analyzing their dependence on baryon density and radial coordinate for varying values of $\alpha$. Our results indicate that EMSG can significantly alter the curvature profiles of neutron stars. In particular, the magnitude of both Weyl and Kretschmann scalars increases (decreases) for a positive (negative) EMSG parameter, with the former exhibiting a larger dependence. Similarly, the surface curvature (SC) is notably affected by $\alpha$. Interestingly, we further observe distinct discontinuities in the curvature profiles at hadron-quark phase transitions, especially in the soft and intermediate HQPT models. These signatures may provide observable imprints of exotic core phases in neutron stars.",
Cross submissions,Extremal Black Holes from Homotopy Algebras,"Jan Gutowski,Chettha Saelim,Martin Wolf",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The uniqueness and rigidity of black holes remain central themes in gravitational research. In this work, we investigate the construction of all extremal black hole solutions to the Einstein equation for a given near-horizon geometry, employing the homotopy algebraic perspective, a powerful and increasingly influential framework in both classical and quantum field theory. Utilising Gaußian null coordinates, we recast the deformation problem as an analysis of the homotopy Maurer-Cartan equation associated with an $L_\infty$-algebra. Through homological perturbation theory, we systematically solve this equation order by order in directions transverse to the near-horizon geometry. As a concrete application of this formalism, we examine the deformations of the extremal Kerr horizon. Notably, this homotopy-theoretic approach enables us to characterise the moduli space of deformations by studying only the lowest-order solutions, offering a systematic way to understand the landscape of extremal black hole geometries.",
Cross submissions,Carpet-3 300 TeV Photon Event as an Evidence for Lorentz Violation,"Hanlin Song,Bo-Qiang Ma",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The detection by the Carpet-3 Group of a 300 TeV photon, observed 4536 seconds after the prompt emission of the historic gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, provides unprecedented opportunities to test Lorentz invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime. By analyzing the temporal and spatial properties of this ultra-high-energy photon in conjunction with lower-energy photons from other bursts and the same burst, we demonstrate consistency with subluminal LV scenarios characterized by an energy scale \( E_{\rm LV} \sim 3 \times 10^{17} \, \rm{GeV} \). This work bridges multi-year LV studies using GeV-TeV photons and establishes GRB 221009A as a pivotal laboratory for quantum spacetime phenomenology.",
Cross submissions,Where are Gaia's small black holes?,"M. Fishbach,K. Breivik,R. Willcox,L. A. C van Son",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gaia has recently revealed a population of over 20 compact objects in wide astrometric binaries, while LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) have observed around 100 compact object binaries as gravitational-wave (GW) mergers. Despite belonging to different systems, the compact objects discovered by both Gaia and the LVK follow a multimodal mass distribution, with a global maximum at neutron star (NS) masses ($\sim 1$-$2\,M_\odot$) and a secondary local maximum at black hole (BH) masses $\sim10\,M_\odot$. However, the relative dearth of objects, or ``mass gap,"" between these modes is more pronounced among the wide binaries observed by Gaia compared to the GW population, with $9^{+10}_{-6}\%$ of GW component masses falling between $2.5$--$5\,M_\odot$ compared to $\lesssim5\%$ of Gaia compact objects. We explore whether this discrepancy can be explained by the natal kicks received by low-mass BHs. GW progenitor binaries may be more likely to survive natal kicks, because the newborn BH has a more massive companion and/or is in a tighter binary than Gaia progenitor binaries. We compare the survival probabilities of Gaia and GW progenitor binaries as a function of natal kick strength and pre-supernova binary parameters, and map out the parameter space and kick strength required to disrupt the progenitor binaries leading to low-mass BHs in Gaia systems more frequently than those in GW systems.",
Cross submissions,On the heat kernel of non-minimal second-order operators,Dario Sauro,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"We analyze the spectra of general non-minimal second-order operators. To do this, we derive the local part of the trace of the second Seeley-DeWitt heat kernel coefficient for such operators in a completely model-independent way. Afterwards, we provide three examples to show how our result can be applied in practical scenarios. In particular, we emphasize this discussion when dealing with a toy-model of dynamical torsion, which is viewed as a simple instance of higher-spin fields. All our results are compatible with the literature, and we provide a Mathematica notebook with the model-independent results that are written in the paper.",
Cross submissions,Constraints on the varying electron mass and early dark energy in light of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 and the implications for inflation,"Yo Toda,Osamu Seto",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Primarily motivated by the Hubble tension, we analyze the varying electron mass model and axionlike early dark energy model (EDE) using baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2 data and including the recent results from ACT DR6. Our analysis indicates that $m_{e} / m_{e0} = 1.0081 \pm 0.0046 $ and the energy fraction of EDE is constrained as $f_\mathrm{EDE} < 0.016$. Since those cosmological models fit with different spectral index $n_s$, we show the posterior of those models on the ($n_s-r$) plane and point out that, for example, Starobinsky inflation works for varying electron mass model while the standard supersymmetric hybrid inflation is preferred in the EDE model.",

Zou",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a measurement of the non-Gaussian four-point correlation function (4PCF) from the DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. For the gravitationally induced parity-even 4PCF, we detect a signal with a significance of 14.7$\sigma$ using our fiducial setup. We assess the robustness of this detection through a series of validation tests, including auto- and cross-correlation analyses, sky partitioning across multiple patch combinations, and variations in radial scale cuts. Due to the low completeness of the sample, we find that differences in fiber assignment implementation schemes can significantly impact estimation of the covariance and introduce biases in the data vector. After correcting for these effects, all tests yield consistent results. This is one of the first measurements of the connected 4PCF on the DESI LRG sample: the good agreement between the simulation and the data implies that the amplitude of the density fluctuation inferred from the connected 4PCF is consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The methodology and diagnostic framework established in this work provide a foundation for interpreting parity-odd 4PCF.",
