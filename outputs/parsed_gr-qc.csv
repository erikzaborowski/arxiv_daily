New submissions,Sources of matter for wormholes in a k-essence theory,"Marcos V. de S. Silva,Carlos F. S. Pereira,Bruna Bragato,Manuel E. Rodrigues,Júlio C. Fabris,H. Belich",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we analyze some matter sources associated with wormhole models within a k-essence theory coupled to the gravitational sector through a phantom scalar field. We adopt a spherically symmetric background in (3+1) dimensions and consider two types of systems: electrically and magnetically charged. In the first case, we consider the generalized Ellis-Bronnikov model, in which we fix the k-essence field exponent to $n=1/2$ and take the parameter $m\ge 2$, where $m$ is the parameter that modifies the area of this wormhole model. From this we obtained the expression for the scalar field, the potential, and the associated electromagnetic functions for any values of the parameter $m\geq{2}$. In the second and third models, we consider the scenario of two wormholes that are structured according to the adjustment of the parameters that define their area function $\Sigma^2$, and in both cases we adopt $n=1/2$. Finally, we show that the violation of the null energy conditions is conditioned by the parameters of the area function.",
New submissions,A well-posed BSSN-type formulation for scalar-tensor theories of gravity with second-order field equations,"Harry L. H. Shum,Llibert Aresté Saló,Farid Thaalba,Miguel Bezares,Thomas P. Sotiriou",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent developments in the modified harmonic and modified puncture gauges have opened new possibilities for performing stable numerical evolutions beyond General Relativity. In this work, we utilise techniques developed in the aforementioned formalisms to derive a BSSN-type formalism compatible with certain classes of modified gravity theories. As an intermediate step, we also derived modified versions of the Z4 and Z3 formalisms, thereby completing the connection between these formalisms beyond General Relativity. We then test the robustness of the new modified BSSN formalism by simulating the dynamics of black hole systems and benchmarking the results against the modified CCZ4 formulation. These developments enable the exploration of theories beyond General Relativity in many well-known Numerical Relativity codes that use different versions of the puncture gauge approach.",
New submissions,Gravitational synchronization in bosonic dark matter admixed neutron stars,"Claudio Lazarte,Nicolas Sanchis-Gual,José A. Font",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"While the search for dark matter remains a central focus of modern astrophysics and high-energy physics, neutron stars provide natural laboratories in which the interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter can be studied. In this work we model dark matter as an ultralight bosonic field, which can accrete onto the neutron star and form a composite object bound through gravity. Using long-term, numerical relativity simulations in spherical symmetry, we extract and analyze the frequency spectra of the radial oscillation modes of fermion-boson stars. Our simulations reveal that the fermionic and bosonic components synchronize through gravitational coupling, enriching their oscillation spectrum. This synchronization leads to new multi-state scalar configurations and reshapes the hierarchy of the neutron-star radial modes. We further propose a procedure to compute the values of the new dominant modes as a function of the bosonic mass, and discuss the implications for neutron-star physics and gravitational-wave astronomy.",
New submissions,"Spin in Uniform Gravity, Hidden Momentum, and the Anomalous Hall Effect","Andrzej Czarnecki,Ting Gao",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We review the recent discussion of the absence of spin Hall effect in a uniform gravitational field, pointing out differences from the anomalous spin Hall effect in ferromagnetics despite a similar form of the Hamiltonian.",
New submissions,Black hole thermodynamics is gauge independent,"O. Ramirez,Y. Bonder",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Black hole thermodynamics provides a rare window into the elusive quantum nature of gravity. In the first-order formalism for gravitational theories, where torsion and gauge freedom are present, it has been suggested that the first law of black hole thermodynamics requires a specific gauge choice, which would undermine its fundamental character. By using principal fiber bundles, it has been shown that the first law is independent of this gauge choice. The present work introduces an alternative method that establishes this independence in a more direct manner, thereby reinforcing the status of the first law as a guide toward quantum gravity. This method also facilitates explicit computations of the first law and helps resolve several ambiguities that commonly appear in such analyses.",
New submissions,Gravitational Wave Detection Based on Gravitomagnetic Effects,"Yu-Qi Dong,Zhoujian Cao,Yu-Xiao Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this paper, we explore the feasibility of detecting gravitomagnetic effects generated by gravitational waves, by monitoring the relative orientation of the angular momentum vectors of test particles. We analyze the response of the relative angular momentum direction to all six polarization modes of gravitational waves and estimate the magnitude of its variation during gravitational wave events. Our findings indicate that when test particles possess magnetic moments, applying an external magnetic field of appropriate strength can induce resonant precession of the angular momentum direction under the influence of gravitational waves. This resonance may significantly amplify the gravitational wave signal, potentially enabling its detection with future gyroscope-based detectors. Such detectors would complement existing gravitational wave observatories that rely on gravitoelectric effects.",
New submissions,Vibration Isolation for the Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna,Brett N. Shapiro,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det),"The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) presents a novel concept for observing gravitational waves from astrophysical sources at sub-Hertz frequencies. Compared to the Earth, the seismic environment of the moon, while uncertain, is known to be orders of magnitude lower, opening the possibility for achieving this sub-Hz band. This band fills the gap between space-based detectors (mHz) and Earth-based detectors (10 Hz to a few kHz). The initial version of LILA, known as LILA Pioneer, calls for non-suspended optics, relying on the moon's resonant modes to respond to gravitational waves. However, the follow-on design, LILA Horizon, requires suspensions to realize in-band free floating test masses and to filter the residual seismic background. This paper will establish baseline designs for these suspensions for different assumptions of the seismic background.",
New submissions,Mixmaster Fluids Near the Big Bang,Elliot Marshall,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We numerically study the approach to the singularity in $\mathbb{T}^{2}$-symmetric cosmological spacetimes containing a non-stiff perfect fluid satisfying a linear equation of state $p=K\rho$, $K \in [0,1)$. Near the singularity, the dynamics are found to be local and oscillatory. In particular, our results show, for the first time, that the fluid velocity in inhomogeneous cosmologies develops mixmaster-esque oscillations consistent with the generalised BKL conjecture of Uggla et al. Moreover, we find these fluid oscillations are responsible for the development of local inhomogeneities in the matter density of the early universe.",
New submissions,A Global Isometric Embedding of the Reissner-Nordström Metric into Pseudo-Euclidean Spacetime,"A.T. Eberlein,C.N. Pope",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The event horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole has been well studied and the singular behavior of the Schwarzschild metric on horizon is understood as a coordinate singularity rather than an essential singularity. One demonstration of this non-singular behavior on horizon was provided by Fronsdal in 1959, by finding a global isometric embedding of the Schwarzschild metric into a six-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. Isometric embeddings for the Reissner-Nordström metric have also been constructed, but they only embed the region external to the inner horizon or in a single Eddington-Finkelstein patch. This paper presents a global isometric embedding for the maximally extended Reissner-Nordström spacetime into a nine-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. We present the solution in terms of explicit local four-dimensional coordinates, and also as a level-set of functions of the higher-dimensional embedding spacetime. While the Reissner-Nordström embedding presented has several similarities to the Fronsdal embedding of the Schwarzschild metric, the presence of the second horizon requires additional embedding coordinates and terms not found in the Fronsdal embedding, in order that the embedding is defined and finite on each horizon.",
New submissions,Gravitational Foundations and Exact Solutions in $n$--Dimensional Fractional Cosmology,"S. M. M. Rasouli,J. Marto,D. Oliveira,P. Moniz",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Three theoretically plausible techniques to developing a fractional scalar field cosmological model are pointed in this paper; the time-dependent kernel weighted action being then selected. Upon this choice, we proceed to establish a fractional cosmological model in $n$ dimensions considering the FLRW metric and a generalized version of the Sáez-Ballester (SB) theory. Our study focuses on the following purposes. Firstly, to investigate the fundamental gravitational structural features of the model, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the field equations, the fulfillment of the Bianchi identities, the associated conservation laws, and the application of the second Noether theorem at the background and first-order perturbation levels. Moreover, the model's distinguishing characteristics and theoretical differences from the corresponding standard scenarios are also investigated.Secondly, we aim to obtain exact analytical solutions and analyze the time evolution of key cosmological quantities, considering the integration constants influence, and the number of spacetime dimensions, and the fractional parameter effects. Furthermore, the model's predictions are compared with those of the corresponding standard models and observational data.Lastly, we propose new ideas to further generalize our model, with a focus on constructing an effective potential and investigating the conditions under which bounce solutions may emerge.",
New submissions,The cosmological volume function,Leonardo García-Heveling,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In a previous work, the regular cosmological volume function $\tau_V$ was introduced as an alternative to the regular cosmological time function of Andersson, Galloway, and Howard. In this paper, we show that in many cases of interest, $\tau_V$ is a continuously differentiable temporal function. This leads to a canonical splitting of the metric tensor, and induces a canonical ``Wick-rotated"" Riemannian metric. We also provide some further results and examples related to the cosmological time and volume functions.",
New submissions,"Thermodynamics of Black Holes, far from Equilibrium","Abhay Ashtekar,Daniel E. Paraizo,Jonathan Shu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"As in thermodynamics, the celebrated first law of black hole mechanics relates infinitesimal changes in the properties of nearby equilibrium states of black holes (without reference to any physical process that causes the transition). The second law is a qualitative statement that the area of an event horizon cannot decrease under appropriate physical assumptions. These laws are generalized. The new first law applies to black holes in general relativity that can be arbitrarily far from equilibrium and refers to \emph{finite} changes that occur due to \emph{physical processes}. The new second law is a \emph{quantitative} statement that relates the change in the dynamical horizon area with the flux of energy falling into the black hole in a physical process.6",
New submissions,Cosmic Acceleration from Quantum Gravity: Emergent Inflation and Dynamical Dark Energy,"Luca Marchetti,Tom R. Ladstätter,Daniele Oriti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a mechanism for the emergence of cosmic acceleration within the mean-field approximation of Group Field Theory models of quantum gravity. Depending on the interaction type, the resulting cosmological dynamics can either feature a late-time attractor corresponding to a dynamical dark energy phase, often with characteristic phantom behavior, including in models inspired by simplicial gravity, or instead support an early slow-roll inflationary epoch driven by the same underlying quantum-gravitational effects. This emergent inflation, effectively captured by a single-field description, can sustain the required expansion, naturally avoids the graceful exit problem, and appears to transition into a persistent, non-accelerating phase consistent with classical expectations.",
Cross submissions,Inflation in light of ACT/SPT: a new perspective from Weyl gravity,Qing-Yang Wang,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) have placed the strictest constraints on the primordial scalar perturbation spectrum, reporting a spectral index of $n_s\sim0.967-0.98$ at 95% confidence level. This result indicates a stronger scale invariance of the scalar perturbation than earlier estimates, posing challenges for numerous inflation models. In this work, we propose an appealing inflationary scenario from the Weyl scale-invariant gravity theory dominated by the higher-order curvatures. Specifically, the exponential curvature extensions are introduced to suppress the mass divergence of the inflaton. We find such scenario naturally yields leading-order predictions of $n_s\simeq1-3/(2N)\sim0.97-0.975$ or $n_s\simeq1-5/(3N)\sim0.967-0.972$ for various models, in excellent agreement with the ACT/SPT constraints. This result builds a concrete bridge between theoretical and observational scale invariance, implying an enduring cosmic echo of the primordial symmetry.",
Cross submissions,Structure of Chern-Simons Graviton Scattering Amplitudes from Topological Gravity Equivalence Theorem and Double Copy,"Hong-Xu Liu,Zi-Xuan Yi,Hong-Jian He",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Gravitons naturally acquire topological masses in the 3d topologically massive gravity (TMG) theory that includes the gravitational Chern-Simons term. We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a topological gravity equivalence theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations. With the extended massive double-copy approach, we systematically construct the graviton (dilaton) scattering amplitudesin the TMG theory from the corresponding gauge boson (adjoint scalar) amplitudes in the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.",
Cross submissions,Geometry of non-Gaussianity in transient non-attractor inflation,"Mohammad Hossein Namjoo,Bahar Nikbakht",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Inflationary models predicting abundant primordial black holes (PBHs) and large amplitude of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) often rely on amplified fluctuations over limited scales, typically driven by phase transitions, particle production, or departures from slow-roll evolution. While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak.",
Cross submissions,Wet Hair: Global Symmetries in Entanglement Islands,"Hao Geng,Jesús Huertas,Andreas Karch,Lisa Randall,Dawson Thomas",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"A central conjecture in quantum gravity is the non-existence of global symmetries. As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair""); $\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shagoulian.",
Cross submissions,Singularities in Cosmological Loop Correlators II : Non Local Interactions and Flat Space limits,"Elaf Ansari,Supritha Bhowmick,Diptimoy Ghosh",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Non-local interactions naturally arise in the ADM formalism after solving the constraint equations and substituting their solutions back into the action. However, the effects of these non-local operators on loop corrections to cosmological correlators remain largely unexplored. Extending the analysis ofarXiv:2503.21880, in this work we compute the $1$-loop bispectrum during slow-roll inflation, including the inverse-Laplacian operators present at cubic and quartic order in the ADM action (in the spatially flat gauge). These non-local vertices introduce non-trivial angular dependencies that significantly complicate the evaluation of loop integrals. We find that the diagrammatic rules ofarXiv:2503.21880for identifying poles and branch cuts in correlators without explicit integration remain valid even in the presence of such non-local interactions. Finally, we derive the flat-space limit of the $1$-loop inflationary correlator and verify it with explicit examples, thereby establishing a direct correspondence between its leading total-energy singularities ($\omega_T\rightarrow0$) and the flat-space scattering amplitude.",
Cross submissions,Correlation and Entanglement partners in Gaussian systems,"Ivan Agullo,Eduardo Martín-Martínez,Sergi Nadal-Gisbert,Patricia Ribes-Metidieri,Koji Yamaguchi",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We introduce a framework to identify where the total correlations and entanglement with a chosen degree of freedom reside within the rest of a system, in the context of bosonic many-body Gaussian quantum systems. Our results are organized into two main propositions. First, for pure Gaussian states, we show that every correlated mode possesses a unique single-degree-of-freedom partner that fully captures its correlations (consisting of entanglement), and we provide an explicit construction of this partner from the complex structure of the system's state. Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode. Finally, we extend the construction of partners to multi-mode subsystems. Together, these results provide conceptual practical tools to study how bipartite correlations and entanglement are structured and where they can be found in complex Gaussian many-body systems.",
Cross submissions,Milky Way Globular Clusters: Nurseries for Dynamically-Formed Binary Black Holes,"Federico Angeloni,Konstantinos Kritos,Raffaella Schneider,Emanuele Berti,Luca Graziani,Stefano Torniamenti,Michela Mapelli",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a novel self-consistent theoretical framework to characterize the formation, evolution, and merger sites of dynamically-formed black hole binaries, with a focus on explaining the most massive events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5. This cosmic evolution is a crucial signature with significant implications for future detectors like the LISA, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, which will be capable to probe the high-redshift Universe.",
Cross submissions,Thermal Spin Waves from Accelerating Domain Walls via the Unruh Effect,"A.L. Bassant,R.A. Duine",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We consider a wire consisting of a conducting ferromagnetic layer and an insulating antiferromagnetic layer that are coupled. The ferromagnet hosts a domain wall, which is dynamically driven by a charge current. We show that for a specific time-dependent current, the domain wall moves according to a Rindler trajectory. This motion excites spin waves in the antiferromagnetic insulator, and their emission spectrum is characterised by an effective temperature analogous to the Unruh temperature, $T_U = \hbar a/2\pi c k_B$, with a the acceleration of the domain wall, c the maximum antiferromagnetic spin wave velocity, and kB the Boltzmann constant. This thermal signature is a direct consequence of the Unruh effect and could be experimentally observed. Our results establish magnetism as a promising platform for probing relativistic quantum field phenomena. Moreover, since the Unruh effect is inherently linked to entanglement, our proposal provides a route for entangling magnetic domain walls via relativistic effects.",
Cross submissions,Supersymmetric Spectral Form Factor of ABJM Theory,Wenni Zheng,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the large-N index analog of the spectrum form factor for ABJM theory in the microcanonical ensemble. In the Cardy-like limit, the most dominant saddle describing the dual black hole decays rapidly at early times. However, the late-time behavior of the spectral form factor is determined by multi-cut saddles, which prevent it from decaying.",
Cross submissions,One-loop power spectrum corrections in interacting dark energy cosmologies,"Emanuelly Silva,Gabriel Hartmann,Rafael C. Nunes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models offer a promising avenue to explore possible exchanges of energy and momentum between dark matter and dark energy, providing a dynamical extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm m}$ and $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = \Gamma \, \rho_{\rm m} \, \rho_{\rm DE} \, \theta_{\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $\Gamma$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $\Gamma$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $\Gamma = 0.0039 \pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work opens the possibility of testing IDE models at mildly non-linear scales, potentially providing new insights for this class of models beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.",
