New submissions,Chaos of charged particles in quadrupole magnetic fields under Schwarzschild backgrounds,"Qihan Zhang,Xin Wu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"A four-vector potential of an external test electromagnetic field in a Schwarzschild background is described in terms of a combination of dipole and quadrupole magnetic fields. This combination is an interior solution of the source-free Maxwell equations. Such external test magnetic fields cause the dynamics of charged particles around the black hole to be nonintegrable, and are mainly responsible for chaotic dynamics of charged particles. In addition to the external magnetic fields, some circumstances should be required for the onset of chaos. The effect of the magnetic fields on chaos is shown clearly through an explicit symplectic integrator and a fast Lyapunov indicator. The inclusion of the quadrupole magnetic fields easily induces chaos, compared with that of the dipole magnetic fields. This result is because the Lorentz forces from the quadrupole magnetic fields are larger than those from the dipole magnetic fields. In addition, the Lorentz forces act as attractive forces, which are helpful to bring the occurrence of chaos in the nonintegrable case.",
New submissions,The Preheating Stage on The Starobinsky Inflation after ACT,"Norma Sidik Risdianto,Romy Hanang Setya Budhi,Nehla Shobcha,Apriadi Salim Adam",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this paper, we reinvestigate the Starobinsky inflation and its reheating features after the ACT results. To make the Starobinsky model satisfy ACT with $68\%$ CL, the number of e-folds increases to $>70$ while the reheating temperature drops to $10^4$ GeV. The preheating stages and the reheating temperature need to be adjusted drastically in favor of the lower temperature. We obtain that the preheating stage of Starobinsky inflation should be mixed between tachyonic and non-tachyonic preheating to favor the analytical estimation, PBH abundance, and the low reheating temperature at once. For that purpose, a varied momentum is necessary to obtain the favored results.",
New submissions,Space-based mm/mg-scale Laser Interferometer for Quantum Gravity,"Nobuyuki Matsumoto,Katsuta Sakai,Kosei Hatakeyama,Kiwamu Izumi,Daisuke Miki,Satoshi Iso,Akira Matsumura,Kazuhiro Yamamoto",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"The experimental verification of the quantum nature of gravity represents a milestone in quantum gravity research. Recently, interest has grown for testing it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Unlike the LPF, our design employs two smaller gold-platinum test masses, each weighing the milligram scale, surrounded by a shield below 2 K, and positioned side by side with a millimeter scale separation. This configuration enables the detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and common-mode motions. We simulate quantum measurements of these modes taking into account gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions to estimate the integration time for GIE detection. Our results show that GIE can be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.",
New submissions,Deflection of light by dark matter supporting traversable wormholes in the framework of Kalb-Ramond gravity,"Susmita Sarkar,Nayan Sarkar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"This study explores the possible formation of asymptotically flat traversable wormholes within dark matter halos under the framework of Kalb-Ramond gravity. The wormhole solutions are derived based on the King and Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter density profiles associated with anisotropic matter sources. For a particular set of parameters, the proposed shape functions are found to be positively increasing and satisfy all the essential geometric conditions along with the flare-out condition, thereby supporting asymptotically flat traversable wormholes. To study the underlying matter content responsible for the wormhole structures, we analyze the null energy condition at the wormhole throat and provide graphical representations of various energy conditions, highlighting both the regions where they are satisfied and where they are violated. The stability of the reported wormhole solutions is confirmed through the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. In addition, we explore several physical features of the wormhole configurations, including the embedding surface, complexity factor, active gravitational mass, and total gravitational energy. Moreover, we investigate the deflection of light by these wormholes, finding that the deflection angle approaches zero at large distances, where the wormhole's gravity is negligible, and diverges near the throat, where the gravitational influence is extremely strong.",
New submissions,Relativistic second gradient theory of continuous media,"Mina Chapon(LMPS),Lionel Darondeau(IMJ-PRG),Rodrigue Desmorat(LMT, LMPS),Clément Ecker(LMPS),Boris Kolev(LMPS)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Variational Relativity is a framework developed by Souriau in the sixties to better formulate General Relativity and its classical limit\,: Classical Continuum Mechanics. It has been used, for instance, to formulate Hyperelasticity in General Relativity. In that case, two primary variables are involved, the universe (Lorentzian) metric $g$ and the matter field $\Psi$. A Lagrangian density depending on the 1-jet of these variables is then introduced which must satisfy the principle of General Covariance. Souriau proved in 1958 that under these hypotheses, the Lagrangian density depends only on the punctual value of the matter field $\Psi$ and of a secondary variable $\mathbf{K}$, the conformation, an invariant of the diffeomorphism group, which is the Relativistic analog of the inverse of the right Cauchy--Green tensor. In the present work, an extension of Souriau's results to a second order gradient theory in General Relativity is presented. Accordingly, new higher order diffeomorphisms invariants are found. Their classical limits are calculated, showing that the 3-dimensional Continuum Mechanics second gradient theory can be derived from such a relativistic theory. Some of these invariants converge to objective quantities in the Galilean limit, others to non-objective quantities. The present work contributes thus to clarify the theoretical foundation of higher gradient Continuum Mechanics theory.",
New submissions,Area-charge inequalities and rigidity of time-symmetric initial data sets,"Tiarlos Cruz,Abraão Mendes",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Differential Geometry (math.DG),"In this paper, we establish new area-charge inequalities for the boundary of time-symmetric Einstein-Maxwell initial data sets, in both compact and noncompact cases, under the dominant energy condition. These inequalities lead to novel rigidity theorems with no analogues in the uncharged setting. In the noncompact case, our result is obtained by applying Gromov's $\mu$-bubble technique in a new geometric context.",
New submissions,Challenges in the nonlinear evolution of unequal mass binaries in sGB gravity,"Llibert Aresté Saló,Daniela D. Doneva,Katy Clough,Pau Figueras,Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It has only recently become possible to simulate the full nonlinear dynamics of binary black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity. The simulations remain technically challenging and evolutions of unequal mass binaries in particular have been difficult to follow through the merger. Even when the merger is successful, accurately quantifying the physical dephasing, as opposed to contributions from transients in the initial data and gauge adjustments, remains difficult. We show the first full simulations of 2:1 and 3:1 binaries through merger, and we discuss how specific choices in the setup affect the dephasing observed and our ability to obtain reliable results. In cases with weaker couplings, we match the expected PN value for the dephasing, whereas for larger couplings, eccentricity introduced by the initial data transients can lead to artificial deviations. Our work highlights the need for improvements in the initial data methods used, to ensure reliable waveforms are obtained for data analysis in beyond-GR models.",
New submissions,Gravitational Lensing by Black Holes in Einstein-nonlinear Electrodynamic Theories with Multiple Photon Spheres,"Siyuan Hui,Benrong Mu,Peng Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this paper, we study the gravitational lensing effects of non-linear electrodynamic black holes. Non-linear electrodynamic black holes serve as typical models for multi-event horizon black holes. Depending on the choice of metric parameters, these black holes can possess more than five event horizons. Consequently, within certain parameter ranges, black holes can have more than three photon spheres of varying sizes outside the event horizon. Specifically, we focus on the strong gravitational lensing effects near the triple photon spheres, particularly the formation of higher-order images of point sources and celestial spheres. The presence of one, two, or three or more photon spheres significantly increases the number of higher-order images of a point source. When a black hole is illuminated by a celestial sphere, the three photon spheres generate three critical curves in the black hole image, with the smallest critical curve coinciding with the shadow's edge. Additionally, since non-linear electrodynamic black holes are models of multi-event horizon black holes, we can infer the gravitational lensing effects and the changes in celestial images for black holes with more than three photon spheres by analyzing the distinctions and patterns between the gravitational lensing effects of one, two, and three photon spheres.",
New submissions,Effect of Non-commutativity on Accretion Disks around RGI-Schwarzschild Black Hole,Dilip Kumar,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this study, we explore the combined effects of quantum gravity induced by non-commutativity and scale-dependent gravitational coupling on the thermal properties of the thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole. We consider a $\kappa$-deformed Renormalization Group Induced (RGI) Schwarzschild black hole, where the classical Schwarzschild black hole geometry is modified by the $\kappa$-deformation of space-time and the running Newton's coupling constant $G(r)$. Using the modified metric, we derive the geodesic motion of massive particles, the effective potential, and the thermal properties such as the radiated energy flux, and the temperature profile of the accretion disk around the $\kappa$-deformed RGI-Schwarzschild black hole. Our study shows that when non-commutativity is combined with the RGI framework, the effects produce a noticeable deviation from the classical Schwarzschild case. In particular, for small values of the deformation parameter, we observe an increase in the peak energy flux and the temperature of the accretion disk. This suggests that quantum gravity corrections enhance the disk's radiative efficiency, especially in the inner regions close to the black hole.",
New submissions,Probing the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a dark matter halo through astrophysical tests,"Tursunali Xamidov,Sanjar Shaymatov,Qiang Wu,Tao Zhu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a recently derived Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) immersed in a Dehnen-type $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=(1,4,5/2)$ dark matter (DM) halo. We obtain constraints on the two model parameters, i.e., the halo core radius $r_s$ and the DM density parameter $\rho_s$ in both the weak and the strong field regimes. In the weak field, we model test particle geodesics and match the predicted perihelion shift to Mercury (Solar System) and the orbit of the S2 star data, obtaining upper limits on $r_s$ and $\rho_s$. In the strong field, we analyse twin high frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) from four microquasars (e.g., GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, XTE J1859+226, and XTE J1550-564). Because QPO frequencies depend only on the local spacetime curvature, they can serve as a probe of halo-induced deviations from general relativity. Our MCMC analysis produces posterior distributions for model parameters, revealing close agreement between the theoretical QPO frequencies and the observations for GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40. The same analysis also yielded best-fit values and upper bounds for each parameter. Our combined geodesic and QPO analysis demonstrates that timelike orbits and epicyclic oscillations can act as sensitive probes of DM halos around BHs, offering a pathway to distinguish Dehnen-type profiles from alternative DM distributions in future analysis and observations.",
New submissions,Transverse relative locality effects in de Sitter spacetime,"Giuseppe Fabiano,Domenico Frattulillo",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) models are characterized by the deformation of relativistic symmetries at the Planck scale and constitute one of the cornerstones for quantum gravity phenomenology research, due to the possibility of testing them with cosmological messengers. Some of their predictions manifest themselves as relative locality effects, implying that events local to an observer might not appear to be so for a distant one. In this work we focus on transverse relative locality models, where the delocalization occurs along the direction perpendicular to the one connecting two distant observers. We present the first generalization of these models in curved spacetime, constructing a transverse deformation of the de Sitter algebra in 2 + 1 D and investigating its phenomenological implications on particle propagation.",
New submissions,Comparing astrophysical models to gravitational-wave data in the observable space,"Alexandre Toubiana,Davide Gerosa,Matthew Mould,Stefano Rinaldi,Manuel Arca Sedda,Tristan Bruel,Riccardo Buscicchio,Jonathan Gair,Lavinia Paiella,Filippo Santoliquido,Rodrigo Tenorio,Cristiano Ugolini",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Comparing population-synthesis models to the results of hierarchical Bayesian inference in gravitational-wave astronomy requires a careful understanding of the domain of validity of the models fitted to data. This comparison is usually done using the inferred astrophysical distribution: from the data that were collected, one deconvolves selection effects to reconstruct the generating population distribution. In this letter, we demonstrate the benefits of instead comparing observable populations directly. In this approach, the domain of validity of the models is trivially respected, such that only the relevant parameter space regions as predicted by the astrophysical models of interest contribute to the comparison. We clarify that unbiased inference of the observable compact-binary population is indeed possible. Crucially, this approach still requires incorporating selection effects, but in a manner that differs from the standard implementation. We apply our observable-space reconstruction to LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data from their third observing run and illustrate its potential by comparing the results to the predictions of a fiducial population-synthesis model.",
Cross submissions,"Gravitational redshift from large-scale structure: nonlinearities, anti-symmetries, and the dipole","Lawrence Dam,Camille Bonvin",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Gravitational redshift imprints a slight asymmetry in the observed clustering of galaxies, producing odd multipoles (e.g.\ the dipole) in the cross-correlation function. But there are other sources of asymmetry which must also be considered in any model which aims to measure gravitational redshift from large-scale structure. In this work we develop a nonlinear model of the redshift-space correlation function complete down to these subleading, asymmetric effects. In addition to gravitational redshift and the well-known redshift-space distortions, our model, given by a compact nonperturbative formula, also accounts for wide-angle effects (to all orders), lightcone effects, and other kinematic contributions. We compare our model with $N$-body simulations and find good agreement; in particular we find that the observed turnover in the dipole moment around a separation of $20\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ (a feature absent in the linear predictions) is well accounted for. By examining the exchange properties of distinct tracers, we identify the pairwise potential difference as the key physical ingredient of the dipole. Several new insights related to the theory of redshift-space distortions are also given.",
Cross submissions,You've got a Freund--Rubin in Me: The Aretakis Instability of Extremal Black Branes,"Calvin Y.-R. Chen,Áron D. Kovács",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate how the Aretakis instability affects non-dilatonic extremal black $p$-branes by focusing on their near-horizon geometry. Crucially, the strength of the instability, \textit{i.e.} the number of transverse derivatives needed to see non-decay/blow-up of fields on the horizon at late null time, is given by the scaling dimensions with respect to the near-horizon $\mathrm{AdS}_{p+2}$-factor. This renders the problem of determining the severity of the Aretakis instability equivalent to computing the Kaluza--Klein spectrum of fields on Freund--Rubin spaces. We use this to argue that non-dilatonic extremal black branes suffer from the Aretakis instability even in the absence of additional fields -- we find that this is weaker than for extremal black holes. We also argue that the scaling dimensions determine the smoothness of stationary deformations to the original black brane background -- here, our findings indicate that generically more modes can lead to worse curvature singularities compared to extremal black holes.",
Cross submissions,Systematics from NICER Pulse Profiles Drive Uncertainty in Multi-Messenger Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State,"Bhaskar Biswas,Prasanta Char",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th),"We present new constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EOS) and mass distribution using a unified Bayesian inference framework that incorporates latest NICER measurements, including PSR J0614$-$3329, alongside gravitational wave data, radio pulsar masses, and nuclear theory. By systematically comparing four inference scenarios--varying in the inclusion of PSR J0614$-$3329 and in the pulse profile model used for PSR J0030+0451--we quantify the impact of observational and modeling choices on dense matter inference. We find that pulse profile systematics dominate EOS uncertainties: the choice of hot spot geometry for PSR J0030+0451 leads to significant shifts in the inferred stiffness of the EOS and maximum neutron star mass. In contrast, PSR J0614$-$3329 mildly softens the EOS at low densities, reducing the radius at \(1.4\,M_\odot\) by \(\sim 100\)~m. A Bayesian model comparison yields a Bayes factor of $\log_{10} \mathrm{BF} \approx 1.58$ in favor of the ST+PDT model over PDT-U, providing strong evidence that multi-messenger EOS inference can statistically discriminate between competing NICER pulse profile models. These results highlight the critical role of NICER systematics in dense matter inference and the power of joint analyses in breaking modeling degeneracies.",
Cross submissions,The Physical Origin and Time Lag of Multi-Frequency Flares from SgrA*,"Hong-Xuan Jiang,Yosuke Mizuno,Indu K. Dihingia,Feng Yuan,Xi Lin,Christian M. Fromm,Antonios Nathanail,Ziri Younsi",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Sagittarius~A$^*$, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, exhibits flares across various wavelengths, yet their origins remain elusive. We performed 3D two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows initialized from multi-loop magnetic field configuration onto a rotating black hole and conducted General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) calculations considering contributions from both thermal and non-thermal synchrotron emission processes. Our results indicate that the polarity inversion events from the multi-loop magnetic field configurations can generate $138\,\rm THz$ flares consistent with observations with the help of non-thermal emission. By tracing the intensity evolution of light rays in GRRT calculations, we identify the precise location of the flaring region and confirm that it originates from a large-scale polarity inversion event. We observe time delays between different frequencies, with lower-frequency radio flares lagging behind higher frequencies due to plasma self-absorption in the disk. The time delay between near-infrared and 43 GHz flares can reach up to $\sim 50$ min, during which the flaring region gradually shifts outward, becoming visible at lower frequencies. Our study confirms that large-scale polarity inversion in a Standard And Normal Evolution (SANE) accretion flow with a multi-loop initial magnetic configuration can be a potential mechanism driving flares from Sgr~A$^*$.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational wave standard sirens: A brief review of cosmological parameter estimation,"Shang-Jie Jin,Ji-Yu Song,Tian-Yang Sun,Si-Ren Xiao,He Wang,Ling-Feng Wang,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard sirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian framework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the measurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and present the potential role of future standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy directions of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in some cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on cosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the most critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe. Finally, we introduce the challenges and the role of machine learning in future standard siren analysis.",
Cross submissions,Analytic Gravitational Wave Spectrum in Next-to-Minimal Bouncing Cosmology,Changhong Li,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Bouncing cosmology offers a singularity-free alternative to inflation, but its minimal realization-comprising only four cosmic phases-predicts a simple power-law stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with a narrow observational window. We introduce the next-to-minimal bouncing cosmology (NMBC), which adds an extra early contraction phase that imprints a broken power-law feature in the SGWB spectrum, enhancing detectability. Using our matrix-representation method grounded in an inequality algebra, we derive a closed-form expression for the NMBC SGWB spectrum. From this analytical result, we show that all NMBC models satisfying the current \(\Delta N_{\rm eff}\) bound \(\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2(f)<1.7\times10^{-6}\) automatically avoid the trans-Planckian problem, \(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}<0.79\,m_{\rm pl}\). These findings establish the NMBC as a self-consistent, self-contained framework capable of generating a potentially detectable SGWB in both astrophysical and laboratory searches, and demonstrate the broad utility of our matrix-representation method for future SGWB analyses in multi-phase cosmologies.",
Cross submissions,Revealing tensions in neutron star observations with pressure anisotropy,"Peter T. H. Pang,Stephanie M. Brown,Thibeau Wouters,Chris Van Den Broeck",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Pressure isotropy, i.e., radial pressure equal to tangential pressure, is often assumed when studying neutron stars. However, multiple physical mechanisms, including pion/kaon condensation, magnetic fields, superfluidity, dark matter clustering, and violations of general relativity, can lead to a pressure anisotropy. This work presents a comprehensive measurement of pressure anisotropy in neutron stars. Our analysis incorporates both an extensive set of nuclear experimental constraints and multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational wave detections and electromagnetic observations. The Bayesian framework employed marginalizes over equation of state uncertainties and allows the anisotropy to vary between individual neutron stars. We find the Bayes factor for anisotropy against isotropy is $e^{0.46}=10^{0.20}=1.58\gtrsim 3:2$. Additionally, the posterior indicates a population-wide preference for negative pressure anisotropy, with GW170817 serving as the primary contributor. The individual variability suggests density-scale-independent anisotropy, potentially attributable to magnetic fields, dark matter clustering, or deviations from general relativity rather than phase transitions. While the evidence for pressure anisotropy remains inconclusive, these results demonstrate that pressure anisotropy can be utilized as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying missing physics in neutron star modeling or revealing tension among observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.",
Cross submissions,Preheated inflation,"Diogo S. Gorgulho,João G. Rosa",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We propose a new mechanism of non-thermal particle production during inflation based on a narrow parametric resonance, akin to the dynamics of post-inflationary preheating. The mechanism is based on the production of scalar particles with a mass that is an oscillating function of the slowly-rolling inflaton field. This is achieved in a scenario for the collective spontaneous breaking of a U(1) gauge symmetry that, while originally proposed in the context of warm inflation, leads to non-equilibrium particle production sustaining a (sub-dominant) non-thermal radiation bath throughout inflation. We show that this may leave an observational imprint, namely oscillatory features in the primordial curvature power spectrum alongside a (mild) resonant enhancement of its amplitude, as well as secondary gravitational waves that can be probed with future CMB experiments.",
Cross submissions,Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects,"Youngsub Yoon,Yong Tian,Kyu-Hyun Chae",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we take into account.",
Cross submissions,Hydrodynamical transports in generic AdS Gauss-Bonnet-scalar Gravity,"Chenwei Tong,Rohit Mishra,Yanqi Wang,Song He",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The experimentally observed temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), along with its apparent violation of the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound $\eta/s=1/(4\pi)$, necessitate a holographic description that incorporates higher-derivative corrections. We propose a five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet model in which a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling $H(\phi)$ encodes leading curvature corrections. Although no closed-form black hole solution is available, we employ an entropy-production analysis at the event horizon to derive exact analytic formulas for the shear viscosity $\eta$ and bulk viscosity $\zeta$. These expressions exhibit apparent deviation from the KSS bound and nontrivial temperature dependence. We then perform an independent computation via the retarded Green function (Kubo) method, finding perfect agreement for $\eta$ and isolating a single constant in $\zeta$ that requires numerical determination. Our dual derivation underscores the pivotal role of higher-derivative terms in realistic QGP modeling and demonstrates the efficacy of nonanalytic holographic backgrounds in capturing the dynamics of strongly coupled fluids.",
Cross submissions,Gravity-mediated entanglement via infinite-dimensional systems,"Stefan L. Ludescher,Leon D. Loveridge,Thomas D. Galley,Markus P. Müller",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"There has been a wave of recent interest in detecting the quantum nature of gravity with table-top experiments that witness gravitationally mediated entanglement. Central to these proposals is the assumption that any mediator capable of generating entanglement must itself be nonclassical. However, previous arguments for this have modelled classical mediators as finite, discrete systems such as bits, which excludes physically relevant continuous and infinite-dimensional systems such as those of classical mechanics and field theory. In this work, we close this gap by modelling classical systems as commutative unital C*-algebras, arguably encompassing all potentially physically relevant classical systems. We show that these systems cannot mediate entanglement between two quantum systems A and B, even if A and B are themselves infinite-dimensional or described by arbitrary unital C*-algebras (as in Quantum Field Theory), composed with an arbitrary C*-tensor product. This result reinforces the conclusion that the observation of gravity-induced entanglement would require the gravitational field to possess inherently non-classical features.",
Cross submissions,Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis,"Siyao Li,Masahide Yamaguchi,Ying-li Zhang",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.",
