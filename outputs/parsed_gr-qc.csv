New submissions,Parameter Estimation of Magnetised Kerr Black Holes Using Their Shadows,"Heena Ali,Sushant G. Ghosh",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the shadow features of magnetized Kerr black holes (MKBHs) using a deviation parameter \( B \) that captures the effect of an external magnetic field on spacetime geometry. These spacetimes, of Petrov type \( D \), are asymptotically non-flat. We use the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation to generate null geodesics and examine the crucial impact parameters for unstable photon orbits that define the black hole shadow. We carefully study how the magnetic field intensity \( B \) and spin parameter \( a \) influence shadow morphology, discovering that increasing \( B \) enlarges the shadow while also introducing additional distortions, especially at high spins. We compute the shadow observables -- area \( A \) and oblateness \( D \) -- and create contour plots in the parameter space \[(a/M, \, BM)\] to facilitate parameter estimation. We also investigate the dependence of the shadow on observer position, specifically altering the radial coordinate \( r_{\mathrm{O}} \) and inclination angle \( \theta \). The results reveal that as \( B \) increases, so does the shadow size, and the distortion is affected by both spin and observer orientation. For far observers, the shadow approaches its asymptotic shape, but finite-distance observers perceive substantial deviations. Our findings demonstrate that MKBH shadows encode clear imprints of magnetic deviations, thereby offering a potential avenue to distinguish Kerr from non-Kerr spacetimes and to probe magnetic effects in the strong-gravity regime.",
New submissions,Negative potential-induced scalarization in the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black hole,"Hong Guo,Miok Park,Yun Soo Myung",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate a negative potential-induced scalarization of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black hole in the EEH-scalar (EEHS) theory, characterized by mass $M$, Euler-Heisenberg parameter $\mu$, and magnetic charge $q$. Within this framework, the charge $q$ can exceed the extremal bound $q/M > 1$, and a single event horizon is maintained provided the parameter $\mu$ exceeds the $\mu_{\text{max}} = 0.019$, with the ADM mass fixed at $M = 1/2$. We obtain a single branch of scalarized EEH (sEEH) black holes for $q > 0$ which is considered as the simplest model for scalarization of EEH black holes. We found that this class of hairy black holes is not thermodynamically favored, and their quasinormal modes indicate they are dynamically unstable. An interesting feature is that when $q < 1/2$, the scalar charge varies only slightly with $q$ for a fixed mass. In contrast, for $q>1/2$, the scalar charge increases more rapidly as $q$ increases. This distinct behavior suggests that the scalar charge exhibits the characteristics of a primary charge for $q < 1/2$, and of a secondary charge for $q > 1/2$. This finding reveals notable features of hairy black holes in EEH theory, specifically in the overcharging regime.",
New submissions,Interacting Scalar Field Cosmology from Full Quantum Gravity,"Tom R. Ladst√§tter,Luca Marchetti",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the relational cosmological dynamics emerging from interacting group field theory (GFT) models minimally coupled to a massless clock scalar field and a self-interacting scalar field. We focus on two broad classes of GFT interactions - pseudosimplicial and pseudotensorial - which generalize simplicial and tensorial interactions, respectively. Treating these interactions perturbatively, we extract the effective cosmological dynamics using mean-field techniques. In the geometric sector, we identify appropriate classical limits of the resulting dynamics, characterized by the emergence of a cosmological constant term in pseudotensorial models and of dynamical dark energy in pseudosimplicial ones. In the matter sector, we find that quantum gravity interactions induce a mass term and modify the classical symmetries of the scalar field dynamics, allowing for a consistent classical matter-geometry description only for specific forms of the effective scalar field potential. Finally, we show that these quantum gravity compatibility conditions on the effective potentials can be relaxed by allowing for a scale-dependent gravitational coupling, and that this running is uniquely fixed once the classical scalar field potential is specified.",
New submissions,Non-flat Universe with Tsallis holographic dark energy,"Artyom V. Astashenok,Alexander S. Tepliakov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigated evolution of metric and density perturbations for Tsallis model of holographic dark energy with energy density $\sim L^{2\gamma - 4}$, where $L$ is length of event horizon or inverse Hubble parameter and $\gamma$ is parameter of non-additivity close to $1$. Because holographic dark energy is not an ordinary cosmological fluid but a phenomena caused by boundaries of the universe, the ordinary analysis for perturbations is not suitable. One needs to consider perturbations of the future event horizon. For realistic values of parameters it was discovered that perturbations of dark energy don't grow infinitely but vanish or freeze. We also considered the case of realistic interaction between holographic dark energy and matter and showed that in this case perturbations also can asymptotically freeze with time.",
New submissions,A generalized static spherically symmetric anisotropic compact star model in isotropic coordinates,"B S Ratanpal,Bhavesh Suthar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this article, an exact solution of Einstein's field equations for spherically symmetric anisotropic matter distributions in isotropic coordinates is obtained. For this, the solution has been obtained by using a generalized physically significant metric potential B(r) and a specific choice of the anisotropy. This new class of generalized solutions is singularity-free, which can be used to describe relativistic compact stars.",
New submissions,Anisotropic compact star model with quadratic equation of state in paraboloidal spacetime,"B S Ratanpal,Bhavesh Suthar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we report a new exact solution of Einstein's field equations for static spherically symmetric anisotropic matter distributions on the background of paraboloidal spacetime by assuming a quadratic equation of state. The model parameters were found by matching the interior spacetime metric with the Schwarzschild exterior metric. The new exact solution is non-singular and meets all of the physical plausibility conditions for a realistic compact star. The detailed physical analysis of the model reveals that the gravitational potentials and matter variables are well-behaved throughout the distribution. The stability of the model has been analyzed under various conditions.",
New submissions,Constraints on the extreme mass-ratio inspiral population from LISA data,"Shashwat Singh,Christian E. A. Chapman-Bird,Christopher P L Berry,John Veitch",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), the inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes, are predicted to be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). A sufficiently large number of EMRI observations will provide unique insights into the massive black hole population. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework capable of constraining the parameters of the EMRI population, accounting for selection biases. We leverage the capacity of a feed-forward neural network as an emulator, enabling detectability calculations of $\sim10^5$ EMRIs in a fraction of a second, speeding up the likelihood evaluation by $\gtrsim6$ orders of magnitude. We validate our framework on a phenomenological EMRI population model. This framework enables studies of how well we can constrain EMRI population parameters, such as the slope of both the massive and stellar-mass black hole mass spectra and the branching fractions of different formation channels, allowing further investigation into the evolution of massive black holes.",
New submissions,A new solution of Einstein-Maxwell field equations in isotropic coordinates,"B S Ratanpal,Bhavesh Suthar",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work, we provide a novel exact solution to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations in isotropic coordinates for charged anisotropic matter distribution, achieved by considering one of the metric potentials as well as a particular form of pressure anisotropy and electric field. We analysed all physical features of a realistic star to ensure the model's viability, and we observed that it met all the physical plausibility conditions. The gravitational potentials and matter variables are well-behaved and regular throughout the distribution. All energy conditions have been verified using graphical representations. The stability criteria of the model have been discussed via different conditions. A detailed physical analysis of the star 4U 1538-52 demonstrates that our model is viable.",
New submissions,Semiclassical polymer field with a cubic potential in cosmology,"Ahsan Mujtaba,Syed Moeez Hassan",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study the semiclassical dynamics of a polymer quantized scalar field with a cubic potential in cosmology. The cosmological spacetime is chosen to be homogeneous and isotropic, and we work in the polymer quantization scheme where the field operator does not exist directly. The dynamics are studied in the `e-fold' time gauge, where a choice of time gauge fixing, in terms of the scale factor, is made at the classical level. The cubic potential is interesting to study because it is unbounded from below. We find that polymer quantization regularizes this potential, and leads to periods of slow-roll as well as exactly de-Sitter inflation.",
New submissions,"Einstein@Home all-sky ""bucket"" search for continuous gravitational waves in LIGO O3 public data","Brian McGloughlin,Jasper Martins,Benjamin Steltner,Maria Alessandra Papa,Heinz-Bernd Eggenstein,Bernd Machenschalk,Reinhard Prix,Maximillian Bensch",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We conduct an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves using LIGO O3 public data from the Hanford and Livingston detectors. We search for nearly-monochromatic signals with frequencies $30\, \text{Hz} \leq f \leq 250\, \text{Hz}$ and spin-down $-2.7 \times 10^{-9}\, \text{Hz/s} \leq \dot{f} \leq 0.2 \times 10^{-9}\, \text{Hz/s}$. We deploy this search on the Einstein@Home volunteer-computing project and on three super computer clusters; the Atlas supercomputer at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, and the two high performance computing systems Raven and Viper at the Max Planck Computing and Data Facility. Our results are consistent with a non-detection. We set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude $h_{0}$, and translate these to upper limits on the neutron star ellipticity and on the r-mode amplitude. The most stringent upper limits are at 173 Hz with $h_{0} = 6.5\times 10^{-26}$, at the 90% confidence level.",
New submissions,ACT-Era Constraints on Single-Field Inflation in $f(T)$ Teleparallel Gravity,"Feng-Yi Zhang,Rongrong Zhai,Li-Yang Chen",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We reassess single-field slow-roll inflation in teleparallel gravity with $f(T)=C\,T^{2\delta+1}$, motivated by recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) that indicate a modest upward shift in the scalar spectral index $n_s$. Using analytic approximations together with high-precision numerical calculations, we compute primordial predictions for representative potentials: power-law monomials, hilltop models, and $E$-type plateaus. We find that torsional corrections controlled by $\delta$ generically suppress $r$ while keeping $n_s$ near its slow-roll value. As a result, modest positive $\delta$ can restore viability to sub-quadratic monomials and hilltop models that are disfavored in general relativity (GR), whereas $E$-type plateaus remain compatible only in a limited range of $\delta$: small $\delta$ may improve the fit but moderate $\delta$ drives the dynamics toward quadratic-like behaviour and increases $r$. These signatures are observationally testable: improved cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode measurements will further discriminate among potential classes and place quantitative bounds on torsional deviations from GR.",
New submissions,Energy-momentum response to metric perturbations in the fluid dynamic regime,"Tim Stoetzel,Rebekka Fechtner,Stefan Floerchinger",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),The interplay of relativistic fluid dynamics and spacetime geometry is discussed in the regime of small wave numbers and frequencies. A combination of gravitational Ward identities and fluid dynamic equations of motion in the Mueller-Israel-Stewart formulation is used to explicitly determine the retarded linear response of the energy-momentum tensor to metric perturbations. We also discuss applications to gravitational wave production and the damping of gravitational waves in a relativistic fluid.,
Cross submissions,Spherical solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation in the expanding universe,Karen Yagdjian,Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We produce an explicit formula for the wave function of the spherically symmetric fields emitted to the FLRW universe with the scale factor generated by the de Sitter universe. As an application of these explicitly written solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation, we test the decay in time of the field generated by a pionic atom.",
Cross submissions,A Theory of the Big Bang in McTaggart's Time,Paul Merriam,History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"There are long standing questions about the Big Bang What were its properties? Was there nothing before it? Was the universe always here? Many conceptual issues revolve around time. This paper gives a novel model based on McTaggarts temporal distinction between the A-series future-present-past and B-series earlier-times to later times. These series are useful while situated in a Presentist and Fragmentalist account of quantum mechanics, one in which the consistency with the Special Relativity in particular the relativity of simultaneity will be made explicit section 6. This allows us to make a fruitful distinction between two pertinent questions what happens as we go to earlier times toward the Big Bang? And: what happens as we go further into the past toward the Big Bang?",
Cross submissions,Bose-Einstein Condensates in Astrophysics and Cosmology: From Quantum Statistics to Cosmic Structures,Nader Haddad,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and their manifestations in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved spacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme gravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and early universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating general relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we demonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star interiors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis reveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial dependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming significant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it exists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3 pc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in galactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence effects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than previously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of cosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions.",
Cross submissions,Analytic Tools for Harvesting Magic Resource in Curved Spacetime,"Jiayue Yang,Dyuman Bhattacharya,Ming Zhang,Robert B. Mann",Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The quantum vacuum is not really empty; it is a reservoir of operationally accessible non-classical resources. Understanding how to extract these resources to fuel information processing is a core objective in quantum technologies and lies at the heart of relativistic quantum information (RQI). While earlier studies of quantum resource harvesting protocols relied primarily on numerical methods, we present, for the first time, exact analytic results for the transition probability and coherence of a qutrit Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a scalar field in anti-de Sitter spacetime of arbitrary dimension. Leveraging these results, we analytically investigate the harvesting of non-stabilizerness and demonstrate that stronger spacetime curvature and higher dimensionality significantly suppress the amount of extractable magic resource from the vacuum. Our analytic framework is readily applicable to other scenarios, laying the groundwork for further analytic studies in RQI.",

Sosa Fiscella",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present the first catalog of targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift, and CW frequency, our strain and chirp mass upper limits are on average 2.6$\times$ more constraining than sky-averaged limits. Bayesian model comparisons against a common uncorrelated red noise for the gravitational wave background (GWB) disfavor a CW signal for almost all targets, yielding a mean Bayes factor of $0.87 \pm 0.31$. There are two notable exceptions: SDSS J153636.22+044127.0, ``Rohan'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 3.37(5)$, and SDSS J072908.71+400836.6, ``Gondor'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 2.44(3)$. These Bayes factors correspond to p-values of $0.01$--$0.03$ ($1.9\sigma$--$2.3\sigma$) and $0.05$--$0.08$ ($1.4\sigma$--$1.6\sigma$), respectively, depending on the empirical null distribution. We outline the beginnings of a detection protocol by identifying and carrying out a battery of tests on Rohan and Gondor to verify their binary nature. Notably, when replacing the common uncorrelated red noise model with a Hellings--Downs correlated GWB, Rohan's Bayes factor drops to $1.25(7)$, while Gondor's increases to $3.2(1)$. Both have rich electromagnetic datasets, including optical and infrared variability and spectroscopic features that support their classification as SMBHB candidates, though this was discovered after the targeted searches were complete. Our results suggest more simulations are needed to confirm or refute the nature of these and future SMBHB candidates, while creating a roadmap for targeted CW detection.",
Cross submissions,Probing Reheating in a Decaying Oscillatory Inflationary Model with Latest ACT Constraints,"Li-Yang Chen,Rongrong Zha,Feng-Yi Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate a moderate upward shift in the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to Planck $2018$, thereby placing tighter constraints on inflationary scenarios. Motivated by these results, we investigate a decaying oscillatory Inflationary model inspired by minimal no-scale supergravity, characterized by the potential $V(\phi) = \lambda \phi^{2n} \sin^2(l/\phi^n)$. We perform a numerical analysis of the background dynamics and reheating process across a range of model parameters. The model yields robust predictions for $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in excellent agreement with current ACT data. Successful reheating in this model requires a large effective equation-of-state parameter approaching unity, consistent with both cosmic microwave background (CMB) and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints. The corresponding number of inflationary $e$-folds increases with $n$ and is weakly sensitive to $l$. Overall, the model offers a simple yet predictive framework that captures both inflationary dynamics and post-inflationary reheating, and remains viable under the latest high-precision observations.",
