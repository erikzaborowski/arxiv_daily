New submissions,Regular black holes with gravitational self-energy as dark matter,"Kimet Jusufi,Douglas Singleton",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We incorporate the effect of non-local gravitational self-energy to obtain a neutral, non-singular spacetime geometry. This is achieved by using a non-local gravitational theory inspired by T-duality, where particle mass is not point-like but smeared over a region. This non-local gravitational self-interaction is derived from the Newtonian gravitational potential and energy density, allowing us to define a coordinate-independent quantity. Thus, we incorporate the non-local gravitational field into the spacetime metric. We demonstrate that the total ADM mass is modified by a finite, regularized gravitational mass term, leading to a regular solution of the Ayon-Beato-Garcia type metric but without electric charge. We show the existence of extremal configurations known as \emph{particle-black hole} objects of order of the Planck mass, which are thermodynamically stable, have a vanishing Hawking temperature and could be a viable dark matter candidate.",
New submissions,THE KERR-SEN Solution Satisfying SO(2) Symmetry,"Winston Chen,Yao-Guang Zheng",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We present a new class of KERR-SEN solutions that respect SO(2) symmetry, constructed systematically using the Laurent series expansion method. This approach is based on stationary, axisymmetric Euclidean solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations and incorporates advanced techniques for generating stationary gravitational fields, including the variation-of-constants method and nonlinear superposition. Through this unified framework, we obtain fresh insights into axially symmetric gravitational systems, extend the traditional hierarchy of Kerr-NUT solutions, and bring together several foundational analytic methods under a common structure.The paper offers explicit derivations, supported by numerical simulations, and provides a detailed discussion of the physical consequences, particularly focusing on the roles of dilaton and axion fields. The extended version also includes a comprehensive historical overview of axisymmetric exact solutions, a thorough explanation of the Laurent series formalism in gravitational theory, and an in-depth analysis of the theoretical and astrophysical significance of KERR-SEN metrics in current research.",
New submissions,Loop-corrected scalar potentials and late-time acceleration in f(R) gravity,"M. V. Pradosh Keshav,Arun Kenath(Christ University, Bangalore)",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We construct an analytic f(R) gravity model that unifies early-time inflation with late-time cosmic acceleration within a single covariant framework. At high curvature, the model reproduces a Starobinsky-like inflationary plateau, while at low curvature it asymptotes to a stable dark energy-dominated phase. In the scalar-tensor representation, this construction yields a hilltop-type potential in the Jordan frame, which maps to an exponential potential in the Einstein frame. To account for radiative effects, we introduce a logarithmic correction to the Einstein-frame potential inspired by one-loop effective field theory, producing a late-time flattening without requiring fine-tuning. The resulting scalaron dynamics reduce the effective mass to O(H_0), inducing a thawing regime that deviates from a cosmological constant at the sub-percent levels. A joint background likelihood analysis using Pantheon+SH0ES and BAO+CC datasets (within the CPL parametrization) yields H_0 = 73.4+-0.6 km/s/Mpc and Omega_m = 0.253+-0.007, consistent with local expansion rate measurements. The best-fit scalar field parameters are phi_0 \approx 0.027\,M_Pl and lambda \approx 0.010\,M_Pl, corresponding to a present-day dark energy equation of state w_0 \approx -0.985. While compatible with LambdaCDM within current observational bounds, the model satisfies GR recovery at low curvature and exhibits attractor-like behavior, thereby minimizing sensitivity to initial conditions.",
New submissions,"Effects of Matter Lagrangian in f(Q,T) Gravity: The Accelerating Cosmological Model","Rahul Bhagat,I. V. Fomin,B. Mishra",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We investigate the logarithmic form of $f(Q,T)$ gravity with two different choices of matter Lagrangian such as: $\mathcal{L}_m = p$ and $\mathcal{L}_m = -\rho$. The parameters of the model has been constrained using Cosmic Chronometers (CC) in combination with DES-SN5YR and Pantheon$^+$ Type Ia supernova datasets. We have observed that the deceleration parameter shows a smooth transition from deceleration to acceleration phase and the effective equation of state parameter ($\omega$) approaches to $-1$ at late times. The $Om(z)$ diagnostic exhibits a decreasing profile, confirming quintessence-like behavior, and the statefinder analysis demonstrates trajectories that remain near the $\Lambda$CDM fixed point but deviate into the quintessence region. The evolution of the density parameters satisfies the flatness condition, and the predicted age of the Universe lies within $t_0 \sim 13.7-14.3$ Gyr, consistent with CMB and stellar estimates. The findings indicate that the logarithmic model successfully reproduces the late-time accelerated expansion for both the choices of the matter Lagrangian.",
New submissions,Maximal GW amplitude from bubble collisions in supercooled phase transitions,Masaki Yamada,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We extend analytic formulas for the gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum from first-order phase transitions to include cosmic expansion under the thin-wall and envelope approximations. We demonstrate that even for strongly supercooled transitions the GW amplitude is bounded from above. Moreover, the spectral shape, amplitude, and peak frequency remain largely unaffected by the details of the nucleation rate once expressed in terms of the comformal variables.",
New submissions,From de Sitter to Anti-de Sitter singularity regularization: theory and phenomenology,"Julio Arrechea,Stefano Liberati,Hooman Neshat,Vania Vellucci",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Recent investigations of vacuum polarization in extremely compact stars suggest that, in such regimes, the effective matter content of spacetime may acquire a vacuum-energy equation of state with negative energy density, mimicking a negative cosmological constant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a general algorithm to modify well-known spherically symmetric regular black hole metrics by replacing their usual de Sitter cores (dSC) with Anti-de Sitter cores (AdSC). Like their dSC counterparts, these AdSC solutions may exhibit two, one, or no horizons depending on the value of a regularization parameter l. We present explicit examples of AdSC-Bardeen and AdSC-Dymnikova metrics, analyze their main properties, and investigate some of their phenomenological signatures using test fields. In particular, we compare their fundamental quasinormal modes and echo signals with those of the dSC cases, highlighting potential avenues for distinguishing them observationally.",
New submissions,Quantum Resolution of Mass Inflation in Reissner-Nordström Interiors via Wheeler-DeWitt Equation,"Chen-Hsu Chien,Woosung Song,Gansukh Tumurtushaa,Dong-han Yeom",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We construct a canonical quantization, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, of the interior geometry of static and spherically symmetric black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ framework, focusing on Reissner-Nordström. The wave function of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Reissner-Nordström black hole is set to be on-shell and exhibiting exponential damping away from the classical locus. Horizon boundary conditions for the wave function generate two regimes: a single inward mode from event horizon yields monotonic decay, while superpositions produce either a quantum bounce (single time arrow) or interference-driven annihilation-to-nothing (two time arrows). We show that these are generic features of static black hole interiors. Furthermore, the wave function of the Schwarzschild black hole, obtained as the charge-neutral limit of the Reissner-Nordström black hole, is monotonically decaying and no longer unbounded. Moreover, this framework unifies classical and quantum interiors, suggests a quantum gravitational resolution to the mass inflation, and motivates extensions to Kerr and regular black holes.",
New submissions,Nonlinear evolution of the spin-2 black hole superradiant instability,"Taillte May,William E. East",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Massive spin-2 fields, which arise in proposed extensions of the standard model of particle physics and general relativity, give rise to a superradiant instability around spinning black holes. We study the nonlinear evolution of this instability in quadratic gravity, where quadratic curvature terms are added to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We find that as the massive spin-2 field grows, the black hole's spin increases, accelerating the growth rate, and eventually leading to a superextremal horizon. This sharply contrasts with the spin-down and eventual saturation that occurs due to the backreaction of the superradiant instability of a minimally coupled massive spin-0 or spin-1 field.",
New submissions,GWKokab: An Implementation to Identify the Properties of Multiple Population of Gravitational Wave Sources,"Meesum Qazalbash,Muhammad Zeeshan,Richard O'Shaughnessy",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"The rapidly increasing sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is enabling the detection of a growing number of compact binary mergers. These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability.In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers.To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3).We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.",
New submissions,Wormholes: Myth or Reality? Prospects for Future Observations,"Subenoy Chakraborty,Madhukrishna Chakraborty",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Traversable wormholes (TWHs) remain one of the most intriguing predictions of General Relativity (GR), offering passage through space-time. However, their existence requires the violation of the null energy condition, making their detection a bit challenging. The essay aims at showing the new avenues probing the observational prospects of TWHs via quasinormal modes and grey body factors, the two fundamental aspects in wave dynamics. The role of QNMs in characterizing the ringdown phase of perturbations and the grey body factors in determining transmission probabilities through wormhole barriers has been investigated. Given their distinct spectral imprints, these features provide a potential means to distinguish wormholes from black holes in gravity wave observations. Advances in high-precision interferometry and multi-messenger astronomy may soon offer crucial insights into the existence of these exotic structures.Essay received Honorable Mention at the Gravity Research Foundation 2025 Awards for Essays on Gravitation",
New submissions,Simulation-based Inference of Massive Black Hole Binaries using Sequential Neural Likelihood,"Iván Martín Vílchez,Carlos F. Sopuerta",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"We propose a machine learning-based approach for parameter estimation of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs), leveraging normalizing flows to approximate the likelihood function. By training these flows on simulated data, we can generate posterior samples via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with a relatively reduced computational cost. Our method enables iterative refinement of smaller models targeting specific MBHB events, with significantly fewer waveform template evaluations. However, dimensionality reduction is crucial to make the method computationally feasible: it dictates both the quality and time efficiency of the method. We present initial results for a single MBHB with Gaussian noise and aim to extend our work to increasingly realistic scenarios, including waveforms with higher modes, non-stationary noise, glitches, and data gaps.",
New submissions,Stability Analysis of Cosmological Perturbations in Bumblebee Model: Parameter Constraints and Gravitational Waves,"Xiao-Bin Lai,Yu-Qi Dong,Yu-Zhi Fan,Yu-Xiao Liu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We constrain the parameter space of Bumblebee model within a cosmological background and investigate the properties of gravitational waves under the constrained parameter set. Specifically, we derive the conditions for the absence of ghost, Laplacian, and Tachyon instabilities for perturbations in a cosmological background. By incorporating the observed accelerated expansion of the universe and the observational constraints on tensor gravitational waves, we derive bounds on the parameter space of Bumblebee model. We then examine the polarization modes, propagation speeds, and amplitude relations of gravitational waves within this constrained framework. Our results indicate that the non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi$ must be non-positive, and the lower bound on the Lorentz-violating parameter $\xi b^2$ is constrained to be on the order of $10^{-15}$. Gravitational waves in Bumblebee model are found to propagate in two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one mixed scalar mode. Notably, the tensor gravitational waves travel at subluminal speeds, whereas the vector and scalar gravitational waves propagate at superluminal speeds. These results provide a concrete theoretical framework and specific observational signatures for testing Lorentz invariance in the gravitational sector with future gravitational-wave detectors.",
New submissions,Blackhole perturbations in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas model,Sunil Singh Bohra,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study blackhole in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas (MGCG) model, a modified gravity framework proposed to unify dark matter and dark energy. The resulting spacetime is asymptotically non-flat and feature two distinct horizons, determined by the Chaplygin parameter {\alpha}. Observational constraints favor negative values of {\alpha}, which restrict the allowed parameter space. Through linear perturbation analysis, we show that this blackhole remain stable under both scalar and electromagnetic perturbation. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectra depend sensitively on the MGCG parameters, indicating that this cosmological model leaves characteristic imprints on blackhole oscillations. These results suggest that gravitational-wave observations of blackhole ringdowns may provide a means of constraining MGCG and testing unified dark sector scenarios in the strong-field regime.",
New submissions,Hybrid waveforms for precessing quasi-circular binary systems,"Joan Llobera-Querol,Sascha Husa,Maria de Lluc Planas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The demand for long and accurate gravitational waveforms is increasing as we prepare for the next generation of detectors and seek to improve current waveform models. However, numerical relativity waveforms, while highly accurate, are often too short for these applications due to their high computational cost. Hybrid waveforms, which stitch together gravitational wave signals from different modeling approaches, provide a way to generate complete inspiral-merger-ringdown signals. While hybridization is well-established for aligned-spin systems, precession introduces additional complexities due to gauge ambiguities, frame dependence, or spin dynamics. Here we study the challenges associated with alignment of precessing waveforms and present a systematic approach for constructing hybrid waveforms of precessing quasi-circular systems. Our approach relies on minimal assumptions about the merger waveforms and employs the quadrupole-aligned frame to mitigate mode-mixing. Our method is designed to be robust and broadly applicable, imposing minimal constraints on the input waveforms. This framework expands the applicability of hybridization techniques, facilitating flexible hybrid construction for parameter estimation, model calibration, and gravitational-wave data analysis.",
New submissions,Local existence theory for a class of CMC gauges for the Einstein-non-linear scalar field equations,Hans Ringström,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The purpose of this article is to develop a local existence theory for a class of CMC gauges for the Einstein-non-linear scalar field equations. We do so in the context of closed and parallelisable initial manifolds. The assumption that the initial manifold is parallelisable is not a topological restriction in the case of closed oriented 3-manifolds, but it is a restriction in higher dimensions. The results include local existence, uniqueness, a continuation criterion and Cauchy stability. Previous results concerning related gauges have been restricted to the case of n-torus spatial topology. Moreover, they have not covered the Einstein-non-linear scalar field setting. The main motivation for developing this theory is that it forms the basis for a family of past global non-linear stability results we derive in a separate article.",
New submissions,Exact cosmological solutions in non-coincidence $f(Q)$-theory,"Avik De,Andronikos Paliathanasis",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We study exact cosmological solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity formulated beyond the coincident gauge, focusing on the non-coincident connection branch $\Gamma_B$. Using a minisuperspace approach, the field equations are recast into an equivalent scalar-tensor form, enabling analytic reconstruction of cosmological models. We obtain exact solutions of particular interest, including de Sitter, scaling, $\Lambda$CDM, Chaplygin gas, generalized Chaplygin gas, and CPL parameterizations. The corresponding scalar potentials and $f(Q)$ functions are derived in closed or parametric form. Our analysis shows that non-coincident $f(Q)$ gravity admits a richer solution space than the coincident case and can describe both early-time inflationary dynamics and late-time acceleration within a unified framework. These results open new directions for testing $f(Q)$ cosmology against observations and exploring its role as a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM.",
Cross submissions,An effective density matrix for vacua in asymptotically flat gravity,"Temple He,Prahar Mitra,Kathryn M. Zurek",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"We explicitly construct the density matrix associated to the vacuum state of a large spherically symmetric causal diamond of area $A$ in four-dimensional asymptotically flat gravity. We achieve this using the soft effective action, which characterizes the low-energy gravitational degrees of freedom that arise in the long-distance limit of the Einstein-Hilbert action and consists of both the soft graviton mode and the Goldstone mode arising from the spontaneous breaking of supertranslation symmetry. Integrating out the soft graviton mode, we obtain an effective action for purely the Goldstone mode, from which we extract the density matrix and therefore the modular Hamiltonian $K_{s}$ associated to the vacuum state. We explicitly compute the mean and variance of $K_{s}$, finding $\langle \Delta K_{s}^{2} \rangle = A/\epsilon_{\text{UV}}^{2}$, with $\epsilon_{\text{UV}}$ being a length-scale UV cutoff on the celestial sphere.",
Cross submissions,Decoding the string in terms of holographic quantum maps,"Avik Chakraborty,Tanay Kibe,Martín Molina,Ayan Mukhopadhyay,Hardik Vamshi",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"It has recently been shown that the Nambu-Goto equation for a string emerges from the junction conditions in three-dimensional gravity. Holographically, gravitational junctions are dual to interfaces in conformal field theory. We demonstrate that each stringy mode of the junction corresponds to a universal $\mathcal{H}_{in}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{out}$ quantum map between in and out Hilbert spaces of excitations scattered at the interface, and also a universal $\mathcal{H}_{L}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{R}$ quantum map relating the excitations on both sides. These quantum maps generalize those realized by defect operators and preserve the conformal boundary condition at the interface.",
Cross submissions,DGLA Actions: An Application in GR,Ryan Grady,Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Algebra (math.QA),"This note serves two purposes: 1) define actions by differential graded Lie algebras, and 2) apply such differential graded Lie symmetry in general relativity (GR) to constrain the spacetime geometry on a neighborhood of infinity.",
Cross submissions,Detector-based measurement-induced state updates in AdS/CFT,"Vijay Balasubramanian,Esko Keski-Vakkuri,Nicola Pranzini",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Conventional understandings of quantum theory hold that measurements change the state of an observed system following the Lüders update rule. Textbooks describe the application of this idea to non-relativistic systems, but extensions to relativistic and gravitating systems encounter subtleties. One consistent approach is via detector-based measurements. We study the effects of such measurements in a CFT with a holographic dual. We work out the boundary space-time regions associated to a Lüders update and how the outcome extends to modifications of the bulk gravity state. We explore information-theoretic consequences of this picture, and relate the information extracted by a measurement to updates of the semiclassical parameters of the bulk state.",
Cross submissions,Thermodynamic Split Conjecture and an Observational Test for Cosmological Entropy,Oem Trivedi,High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We revisit string theoretic derivations of black hole entropy and argue that their enabling structures do not persist in realistic cosmologies. We formalize this as the Thermodynamic Split Conjecture (TSC) which is the statement that in any UV complete quantum gravity, black hole and cosmological horizon thermodynamics are generically inequivalent. The BKE criterion is then formulated to formalize this approach while we also discuss ways to falsify the conjecture. Finally, we propose an observational scaling test which is centered around comparisons of data native entropy proxies from tomographic maps to the Bekenstein Hawking prediction. The framework both sharpens when and why the area law holds and provides a roadmap towards a UV complete description of cosmological horizon entropy.",
Cross submissions,Polar Mounds on Strangeon Stars: the Neutrino Emission from Ultraluminous X-ray Pulsars,"Hong-Bo Li,Shi-Jie Gao,Xiang-Dong Li,Ren-Xin Xu",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) serve as unique astrophysical laboratories, offering critical insights into accretion physics under extreme conditions, such as strong magnetic fields and super-Eddington accretion rates. Additionally, the nature of pulsars, i.e., the equation of state of supranuclear matter, is still a matter of intense debate, basing on either conventional neutron stars or strange stars in the litterateurs. In this work, we investigate accretion columns of ULXPs based on the strangeon-star model, focusing on the thermal mound at the column base. Accounting for Coulomb and strangeness barriers of the strangeon stars, we find that the mound can reach $0.7-0.95\,\rm km$ in height with temperatures above $10^9\, \rm K$, enabling substantial neutrino emission via electron-positron annihilation. Heat transport along the strangeon star surface contributes a luminosity of $10^{36} \, \rm erg\, s^{-1} $, independent of the accretion rate. At low accretion rates ($< 10^{20}\, \rm g\,s^{-1}$), photons dominate the luminosity, while at higher rates ($> 10^{21}\, \rm g\, s^{-1}$), photon trapping makes neutrino emission the main cooling channel, with total luminosity exceeding photon emission, which saturates near $10^{41}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Estimating neutrino fluxes at Earth, we find that only the nearest ULXP, Swift J0243.6$+$6124, could produce a marginally detectable signal, while most extragalactic sources remain well below background levels. These results emphasize the key role of the thermal mound and strangeon star properties in determining accretion luminosities and neutrino emission, offering insights for future modeling and observations of ULXPs.",
Cross submissions,The effect of matter discreteness on gravitational wave propagation in post-geometrical optics,"Sena Atli,Syksy Rasanen",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"The gravitational wave equation of motion includes direct coupling to the Riemann tensor. The curvature terms are usually neglected, but they can be large at the location of matter particles and impact the angular diameter distance. We apply the recently introduced post-geometrical optics approximation that includes curvature to gravitational wave propagation. Assuming that particles are localised within their Compton wavelength, the curvature due to electrons leads to a large effect on the angular diameter distance, but caustic formation invalidates the post-geometrical optics approximation. We conclude that the interesting regime of validity of the approximation is limited, as it ceases to apply when the curvature effects become large. Other methods are needed to evaluate the effect of curvature spikes, and the localisation of particles due to decoherence also needs further work.",
Cross submissions,Improving cosmological reach of a gravitational wave observatory using Deep Loop Shaping,"Jonas Buchli,Brendan Tracey,Tomislav Andric,Christopher Wipf,Yu Him Justin Chiu,Matthias Lochbrunner,Craig Donner,Rana X. Adhikari,Jan Harms,Iain Barr,Roland Hafner,Andrea Huber,Abbas Abdolmaleki,Charlie Beattie,Joseph Betzwieser,Serkan Cabi,Jonas Degrave,Yuzhu Dong,Leslie Fritz,Anchal Gupta,Oliver Groth,Sandy Huang,Tamara Norman,Hannah Openshaw,Jameson Rollins,Greg Thornton,George Van Den Driessche,Markus Wulfmeier,Pushmeet Kohli,Martin Riedmiller,LIGO Instrument Team",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Systems and Control (eess.SY); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.",
