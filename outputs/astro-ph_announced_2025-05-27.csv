Insights on the Cosmic Origin of Matter from Proton Stability,"Admir Greljo,Xavier Ponce Díaz,Anders Eller Thomsen",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the phenomenology of a model in which the proton is rendered absolutely stable by an IR mechanism that remains robust against unknown quantum gravity effects. A linear combination of baryon number and lepton flavors is gauged and spontaneously broken to a residual $\mathbb{Z}_9$ discrete gauge symmetry enforcing a strict selection rule: $\Delta B = 0\,(\mathrm{mod}\,3)$. Despite its minimal field content, the model successfully accounts for established empirical evidence of physics beyond the SM. High-scale symmetry breaking simultaneously provides a seesaw mechanism explaining the smallness of neutrino masses, minimal thermal leptogenesis, and a viable phenomenology of the majoron as dark matter. Any cosmic string-wall network remaining after inflation is unstable for numerous charge assignments. Lepton flavor non-universality, central to the construction, leads to predictive neutrino textures testable via oscillation experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay, and cosmology. The model motivates searches in $X$- and $\gamma$-ray lines, neutrino telescopes, and predicts CMB imprints.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18259
"Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Myrzakulov Gravity from $R + F(T, G)$: Numerical Insights and Torsion-Gauss-Bonnet Dynamics in Weitzenböck Spacetime","Davood Momeni,Ratbay Myrzakulov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The study of modified gravity models has garnered significant attention because of their potential to provide alternative explanations for cosmological phenomena, such as the accelerated expansion of the universe and the nature of dark energy. One such model, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Myrzakulov $R + F(T, G)$ gravity (EGBMG), which incorporates the curvature $R$, torsion $T$, and the Gauss-Bonnet term $G$, offers a promising framework to explore the dynamics of the universe and its evolution. This paper delves into the theoretical and observational implications of the EGBMG model, focusing on its ability to address long-standing challenges in cosmology, including the evolution of dark energy and the transition from early-time inflationary behavior to late-time acceleration. We review recent advancements in the model, including its compatibility with observational data and its ability to provide new insights into cosmic acceleration. Through a combination of theoretical models, dynamical systems analysis, and cosmological diagnostics, we demonstrate the robustness of the EGBMG framework in explaining the large-scale structure of the universe and its accelerated expansion. This paper serves as a step toward further exploring the potential of this model to understand the fundamental forces driving Weitzenb$ö$ck spacetime.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18285
Detecting gravitational waves with light,Markus Pössel,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Physics Education (physics.ed-ph),"The strong evidence for low-frequency gravitational waves from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), published in 2023, has widened the scope for teaching about gravitational wave astronomy. This article provides a simple, unified overview of the detection of gravitational waves using light waves that encompasses the recent PTA detections, the by-now classic interferometric detections using LIGO and similar detectors, and the yet-to-be-accomplished detections using long-arm detectors like the spaceborne LISA. The presentation is at a level accessible for undergraduate students. The influence of gravitational waves on light is derived in a way that makes use only of basic gravitational wave properties and Einstein's equivalence principle.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18639
Clustering and physical properties of AGN and Star-Forming Galaxies at fixed stellar mass: does assembly bias have a role in AGN activity?,"Amrita Banerjee,Biswajit Pandey,Anindita Nandi",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We analyze a volume-limited sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to compare the spatial clustering and physical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFG) at fixed stellar mass. We find no statistically significant difference in clustering strength or local density between AGN and SFG. However, after matching their stellar mass distributions, we detect statistically significant differences (at a confidence level $>99.99\%$) in colour, star formation rate (SFR), $4000Å$ break measurements (D$4000$), and morphology. These differences persist across both low- and high-density environments, suggesting that AGN are not driven by environmental factors. The development of favourable conditions for AGN activity within a galaxy may depend on the diverse evolutionary histories of galaxies. Our results imply that AGN activity may arise stochastically, modulated by the complex assembly history of galaxies.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12943
"On the full non-Gaussian Surprise statistic and the cosmological concordance between DESI, SDSS and Pantheon+","Pedro Riba Mello,Miguel Quartin,Bjoern Malte Schaefer,Benedikt Schosser",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"With the increasing precision of recent cosmological surveys and the discovery of important tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, it is becoming more and more important to develop tools to quantify accurately the discordance between different probes. One such tool is the Surprise statistic, a measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The Surprise, however, has been up to now applied only under its Gaussian approximation, which can fail to properly capture discordance in cases that deviate significantly from Gaussianity. In this paper we developed the \texttt{klsurprise} code which computes the full numerical non-Gaussian Surprise, and analyse the Surprise for BAO + BBN and supernova data. We test different cosmological models, some of which the parameters deviate significantly from Gaussianity. We find that the non-Gaussianities, mainly present in the Supernova dataset, change the Surprise values significantly from its Gaussian approximation, and reveal a borderline $2.0\sigma$ tension in the curved $w$CDM model (o$w$CDM) between the combined Pantheon+ and SH0ES (Pantheon+ & SH0ES) data and the dataset which combines SDSS, BOSS and eBOSS BAO. This modest tension is hidden in the Gaussian Surprise approximation. For DESI, the discrepancy with Pantheon+ & SH0ES is at the $1.5\sigma$ level for o$w$CDM, but a large $3.4\sigma$ for $\Lambda$CDM. Removing SH0ES data drops the $\Lambda$CDM significance to $2.6\sigma$.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08385
The multi-dimensional halo assembly bias can be preserved when enhancing halo properties with HALOSCOPE,"Sujatha Ramakrishnan,Violeta Gonzalez-Perez,Gabriele Parimbelli,Gustavo Yepes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Over $90$\% of dark matter haloes in cosmological simulations have unresolved properties. This can hinder the dynamical range of simulations and result in systematic biases when modelling cosmological tracers. We aim to more precisely determine unresolved structural and dynamical halo properties while preserving the correlations with environment and halo assembly bias found in simulations. We have developed HALOSCOPE, a machine learning technique that uses multi-variate conditional probability distribution functions. This method ensures that correlations among various halo properties, as well as their dependence on the local environment, are preserved. In this work, we trained HALOSCOPE with a high-resolution (HR) simulation and used it to better determine the properties (concentration, spin, and two shape parameters) of unresolved dark matter haloes in an eight times lower resolution simulation. HALOSCOPE is able to recover the multi-dimensional halo assembly bias, that is, the correlations of different combinations of halo properties with the large-scale environment, measured in the HR simulation. This is achieved by including the linear halo-by-halo bias and tidal anisotropy in the set of input training parameters. HALOSCOPE, by design, also recovers the joint distribution of the halo properties. To study how resolution effects propagate into the clustering of model galaxies, we generated catalogues of central galaxies using two implementations of the assembly bias in a halo occupation distribution model. The clustering of central model galaxies is improved by a factor of three at $0.009<k ({\rm Mpc}^{-1}h)<0.6$ when the unresolved haloes are enhanced with HALOSCOPE. HALOSCOPE can improve the accuracy of cosmological tracer catalogues produced with approximate methods when many realisations are needed.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07361
Improving Galaxy Cluster Selection with the Outskirt Stellar Mass of Galaxies,"Matthew Kwiecien,Tesla Jeltema,Alexie Leauthaud,Song Huang,Eli Rykoff,Sven Heydenreich,Johannes Lange,Spencer Everett,Conghao Zhou,Paige Kelly,Yuanyuan Zhang,Tae-Hyeon Shin,Jesse Golden-Marx,J.

Wiseman",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The number density and redshift evolution of optically selected galaxy clusters offer an independent measurement of the amplitude of matter fluctuations, $S_8$. However, recent results have shown that clusters chosen by the redMaPPer algorithm show richness-dependent biases that affect the weak lensing signals and number densities of clusters, increasing uncertainty in the cluster mass calibration and reducing their constraining power. In this work, we evaluate an alternative cluster proxy, outskirt stellar mass, $M_{\textrm{out}}$, defined as the total stellar mass within a $[50,100]$ kpc envelope centered on a massive galaxy. This proxy exhibits scatter comparable to redMaPPer richness, $\lambda$, but is less likely to be subject to projection effects. We compare the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 redMaPPer cluster catalog with a $M_{\textrm{out}}$ selected cluster sample from the Hyper-Suprime Camera survey. We use weak lensing measurements to quantify and compare the scatter of $M_{\textrm{out}}$ and $\lambda$ with halo mass. Our results show $M_{\textrm{out}}$ has a scatter consistent with $\lambda$, with a similar halo mass dependence, and that both proxies contain unique information about the underlying halo mass. We find $\lambda$-selected samples introduce features into the measured $\Delta \Sigma$ signal that are not well fit by a log-normal scatter only model, absent in $M_{\textrm{out}}$ selected samples. Our findings suggest that $M_{\textrm{out}}$ offers an alternative for cluster selection with more easily calibrated selection biases, at least at the generally lower richnesses probed here. Combining both proxies may yield a mass proxy with a lower scatter and more tractable selection biases, enabling the use of lower mass clusters in cosmology. Finally, we find the scatter and slope in the $\lambda-M_{\textrm{out}}$ scaling relation to be $0.49 \pm 0.02$ and $0.38 \pm 0.09$.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20205
Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter,"Philippe Brax,Patrick Valageas",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS),"The dynamics of ultralight dark matter with non-negligible self-interactions are determined by a nonlinear Schrödinger equation rather than by the Vlasov equation of collisionless particles. This leads to wave-like effects, such as interferences, the formation of solitons, and a velocity field that is locally curl-free, implying that vorticity is carried by singularities associated with vortices. Using analytical derivations and numerical simulations in 2D, we study the evolution of such a system from stochastic initial conditions with nonzero angular momentum. Focusing on the Thomas-Fermi regime, where the de Broglie wavelength of the system is smaller than its size, we show that a rotating soliton forms in a few dynamical times. The rotation is not associated with a large orbital quantum number of the wave function. Instead, it is generated by a regular lattice of vortices that gives rise to a solid-body rotation in the continuum limit. Such rotating solitons have a maximal radius and rotation rate for a given central density, while the vortices follow the matter flow on circular orbits. We show that this configuration is a stable minimum of the energy at fixed angular momentum and we check that the numerical results agree with the analytical derivations. We expect most of these properties to extend to the 3D case where point vortices would be replaced by vortex rings.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02297
Curvature perturbations from vacuum transition during inflation,"Björn Garbrecht,Pulkit S. Ghoderao,Arttu Rajantie",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We demonstrate that in the presence of a light scalar spectator field, vacuum transitions taking place during inflation can produce large, potentially detectable non-Gaussian signatures in the primordial curvature perturbation. Such transitions are common in theories with multiple scalar fields when the potential has several minima. Our computation proceeds by numerically finding the instanton solution that describes quantum tunnelling between vacuum states in a de Sitter background, calculating its dependence on the spectator field and, thereby, its effect on the expansion of space. For a scenario with Higgs inflation, we obtain the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_\mathrm{NL} \sim O(10)$ and study its parameter dependence.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01632
Observable Primordial Gravitational Waves from Non-minimally Coupled $R^2$ Palatini Modified Gravity,"Hardik Jitendra Kuralkar,Sukanta Panda,Archit Vidyarthi",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We probe the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) produced during the eras of hyperkination, kination, and reheating in a non-minimally coupled, $\mathcal{L} \propto (1+ \xi \chi /M_{\text{Pl}})^t (R+\alpha R^2)$, modified gravity using the Palatini formulation. We consider a runaway potential, which gives an era of kinetic domination after the end of inflation. The coupling order $t$ is varied to examine a large class of theories up to $\chi^2 R^2$. For models with $t>0$, reheating is not achieved naturally; hence, we supplement such theories with a reheating mechanism based on the interaction of inflaton and radiation produced at the end of inflation due to cosmological expansion. We demonstrate that the energy density of the GWs is enhanced as a function of the coupling during kination for all considered theories, and a short-lived phase of hyperkination truncates the boost and avoids the over-production of GWs. Hyperkination, and thus the $R^2$ term, should be deemed necessary in all theories with a runaway potential as it prevents the GW enhancement during kination from destabilizing the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The spectrum remains flat for the period of hyperkination and reheating. We examine the available parameter space for which the theories remain valid and place bounds on the Hubble parameter ($H$) and radiation energy density ($\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$) at the end of inflation. We find that as we decrease the order of the coupling, the spectra shift towards a more observable regime of future GW experiments. The observation of the plateau during reheating will constrain the $H$ and $\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$ values, while the spectral shape of the boost obtained during kination will confirm the nature of the theory. The bounds from hyperkination lie in the kHz-GHz frequency range.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03573
3D Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter,"Ph. Brax,P. Valageas",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study the formation and the dynamics of vortex lines in rotating scalar dark matter halos, focusing on models with quartic repulsive self-interactions. In the nonrelativistic regime, vortex lines and their lattices arise from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of motion, as for superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates studied in laboratory experiments. Indeed, in such systems vorticity is supported by the singularities of the phase of the scalar field, which leads to a discrete set of quantized vortices amid a curl-free velocity background. In the continuum limit where the number of vortex lines becomes very large, we find that the equilibrium solution is a rotating soliton that obeys a solid-body rotation, with an oblate density profile aligned with the direction of the total spin. This configuration is dynamically stable provided the rotational energy is smaller than the self-interaction and gravitational energies. Using numerical simulations in the Thomas-Fermi regime, with stochastic initial conditions for a spherical halo with a specific averaged density profile and angular momentum, we find that a rotating soliton always emerges dynamically, within a few dynamical times, and that a network of vortex lines aligned with the total spin fills its oblate profile. These vertical vortex lines form a regular lattice in the equatorial plane, in agreement with the analytical predictions of uniform vortex density and solid-body rotation. These vortex lines might further extend between halos to form the backbone of spinning cosmic filaments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12100
Dark sirens and the impact of redshift precision,"Madeline L. Cross-Parkin,Cullan Howlett,Tamara M. Davis,Nandita Khetan",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"With the growing number of gravitational wave detections, achieving a competitive measurement of $H_0$ with dark sirens is becoming increasingly feasible. The expansion of the Ligo-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration into a four detector network will reduce both the localisation area and the luminosity distance uncertainty associated with each gravitational wave event. It is therefore essential to identify and mitigate other major sources of error that could increase the uncertainty in $H_0$. In this work, we explore three scenarios relevant to the dark siren method in future observing runs. First, we demonstrate that there is a precision gain offered by a catalogue of spectroscopic-like redshifts compared to photometric-like redshifts, with the greatest improvements observed in smaller localisation areas. Second, we show that redshift outliers (as occur in realistic photometric redshift catalogues), do not introduce bias into the measurement of $H_0$. Finally, we find that uniformly sub-sampling spectroscopic-like redshift catalogues increases the uncertainty in $H_0$ as the completeness fraction is decreased; at a completeness of 50% the benefit of spectroscopic redshift precision is outweighed by the degradation from incompleteness. In all three scenarios, we obtain unbiased estimates of $H_0$. We conclude that a competitive measurement of $H_0$ using the dark siren method will require a hybrid catalogue of both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts, at least until highly complete spectroscopic catalogues become available.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17747
Improving Cosmic Birefringence Constraints via Delensing,Anto Idicherian Lonappan,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a study on using delensing to enhance cosmic birefringence measurements based on full-sky, map-based simulations. In our analysis, we neglect foreground contamination and instrumental systematics to isolate the intrinsic impact of delensing on both isotropic and anisotropic birefringence. For the isotropic case, assuming a constant rotation angle of $\beta = 0.35^\circ$, delensing reduces the lensing-induced variance in the EB power spectrum, yielding an improvement in sensitivity of approximately 10% at 6 $\mu$K-arcmin noise and 25-40% at lower noise levels. For the anisotropic case, using simulations at 1 $\mu$K-arcmin noise, we reconstruct the birefringence angle for a scale-invariant spectrum and mitigate lensing bias by delensing, achieving a 50% reduction in the leading $N_{(0)}$ bias and a 30% improvement in the constraints on the amplitude $A_{CB}$. Our results demonstrate that delensing is an effective tool for enhancing the detectability of subtle parity-violating signals in the cosmic microwave background with forthcoming experiments such as the Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04708
GD-1 and the Milky Way Starless Subhalos,Raymond G. Carlberg,Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Measurements of the GD-1 star stream velocity distribution within $\pm$3 degrees of the centerline find a total line of sight velocity spread of 5-6 km/s in the well measured $\phi_1=$ [-30, 0] region (Valluri25). The velocity spread is far above the $\sim$2-3 km/s of a dissolved globular cluster in a smooth galactic potential. The dynamical heating of the GD-1 star stream is simulated in an evolving model Milky Way potential which includes the subhalos extracted from cosmological CDM and WDM Milky Way-like halos. The model bridges fully cosmological Milky Way-like halos and late time static Milky Way potentials allowing individual streams to be accurately integrated. An evolving CDM subhalo population acting for $\sim$11 Gyr heats GD-1 to 6.2 km/s. The WDM (7 keV and lighter) models develop a velocity dispersion of 3.9 km/s, only slightly greater than the 3.5 km/s in an evolving smooth halo without subhalos for 11 Gyr. The dynamical age of the best model stream is close to the isochrone age of the stars in the stream. Subhalos with masses in the decade around $10^{7.5} M_\odot$, below the mass range of dwarf galaxies, dominate the dynamical stream heating.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13290
Dark Matter (S)pins the Planet,"Haihao Shi,Junda Zhou,Zhenyang Huang,Guoliang Lü,Xuefei Chen",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, we find that the energy input from dark matter raises planetary temperatures and accelerates rotation. The distribution of energy between heating and rotational acceleration depends on both planetary properties and external inputs, suggesting that previous studies may have overestimated the heating contribution. At high dark matter densities, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and becomes primarily governed by dark matter effects.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17206
How do Massive Primordial Black Holes Impact the Formation of the First Stars and Galaxies?,"Saiyang Zhang,Boyuan Liu,Volker Bromm,Junehyoung Jeon,Michael Boylan-Kolchin,Florian Kuhnel",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the impact of massive primordial black holes (PBHs; $m_{\rm BH}\sim 10^6~M_{\odot}$) on the star formation and first galaxy assembly process using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations from $z = 1100$ to $z \sim 9$. We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing mass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by seeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong feedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the presence of baryon-dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH location and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more efficient star formation compared to standard $\Lambda$CDM. By $z \sim 10$, PBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios comparable to observed high-$z$ AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as viable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that PBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered overmassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of BH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels. Future studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and radio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in distinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17585

Dynamical Dark Energy Emerges from Massive Gravity,Juri Smirnov,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $4.0 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 3$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03870
Primordial black hole-star binaries via dynamical friction,Nicolas Esser,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We study a new channel for binary system formation involving stars and stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) embedded in dark matter (DM) minihalos. In this scenario, binaries form when a star passes through the DM minihalo surrounding a PBH and loses sufficient energy due to dynamical friction. The continued energy loss induced by this friction is expected to drive the resulting systems to merge rapidly. We estimate their merger rate and explore the implications for two observables: rapidly decaying X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and gravitational waves sourced by compact object mergers. We find that this mechanism naturally produces a population of O(1) currently observable short-lived X-ray binaries. It also leads to a non-negligible gravitational wave event rate of O(0.3) Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, potentially involving high mass ratios and black holes in the lower or upper mass gap. This dynamical friction channel thus offers a plausible explanation for several unusual observations reported in recent years across both the X-ray and gravitational wave domains.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05564
Beyond the Power Spectrum: A New Framework for Non-Stationary Fields with Applications to Light-Cone Effects in Line Intensity Mapping,"Mattéo Blamart,Adrian Liu",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Modern cosmological surveys cover extremely large volumes and map fluctuations on scales reaching gigaparsecs. As a result, it is no longer a valid assumption to ignore cosmological evolution along the line of sight from one end of the survey to the other. When extracting cosmological information, the power spectrum becomes suboptimal because it relies on the assumption of translational invariance of the observed field. For example, during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the 21cm brightness temperature field on the nearby (low-redshift) end of a large survey volume exhibits statistical properties that differ significantly from those at far (high-redshift) end. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a eigen decomposition-inspired non-Fourier basis that captures evolution effects. Our work demonstrates that using this new basis integrated in a new summary statistic yields tighter constraints on astrophysical parameters compared to the traditional power spectrum. Additionally, we provide an illustrative example and a practical guide for applying this basis in the context of a realistic forecast for interferometers such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09674
Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity,"Samuel Sánchez López,José Jaime Terente Díaz",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13420
Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter with the James Webb Space Telescope,"Haipeng An,Shuailiang Ge,Jia Liu,Zhiyao Lu",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"In this study, we propose an investigation into dark photon dark matter (DPDM) within the infrared frequency band, utilizing highly sensitive infrared light detectors commonly integrated into space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The presence of DPDM induces electron oscillations in both the reflectors and the interior of the detectors. Consequently, these oscillating electrons can emit monochromatic electromagnetic waves with a frequency almost equivalent to the mass of DPDM. By estimating the signal generated by DPDM inside the detector and comparing with observation data, we establish constraints on the kinetic mixing between the photon and dark photon within the range [10, 500] THz. Despite JWST not being optimized for DPDM searches, our findings reveal constraints comparable to those obtained from the XENON1T experiment in the laboratory, as well as astrophysical constraints from solar emission. Additionally, we propose to modify the configuration of JWST optical elements to focus the DPDM induced signal onto the detector. By employing the stationary phase approximation, we can demonstrate that when the size of the reflector significantly exceeds the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the contribution to the electromagnetic wave field at a given position primarily stems from the surface unit perpendicular to the relative position vector. This simplification results in the reduction of electromagnetic wave calculations to ray optics. We show that by rearranging the position of reflectors, JWST can achieve a sensitivity stronger than the existing limits by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17140
Resonant or asymmetric: The status of sub-GeV dark matter,"Sowmiya Balan,Csaba Balázs,Torsten Bringmann,Christopher Cappiello,Riccardo Catena,Timon Emken,Tomás E. Gonzalo,Taylor R. Gray,Will Handley,Quan Huynh,Felix Kahlhoefer,Aaron C. Vincent",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles produced via thermal freeze-out evade many of the strong constraints on heavier DM candidates but at the same time face a multitude of new constraints from laboratory experiments, astrophysical observations and cosmological data. In this work we combine all of these constraints in order to perform frequentist and Bayesian global analyses of fermionic and scalar sub-GeV DM coupled to a dark photon with kinetic mixing. For fermionic DM, we find viable parameter regions close to the dark photon resonance, which expand significantly when including a particle-antiparticle asymmetry. For scalar DM, the velocity-dependent annihilation cross section evades the strongest constraints even in the symmetric case. Using Bayesian model comparison, we show that both asymmetric fermionic DM and symmetric scalar DM are preferred over symmetric fermionic DM due to the reduced fine-tuning penalty. Finally, we explore the discovery prospects of near-future experiments both in the full parameter space and for specific benchmark points. We find that the most commonly used benchmark scenarios are already in tension with existing constraints and propose a new benchmark point that can be targeted with future searches.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17548
Cosmology of Quasi-Dilaton Massive Gravity with Non-minimal Kinetic Coupling,"Sobhan Kazempour,Amin Rezaei Akbarieh,Sichun Sun,Chengye Yu",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"In this study, we introduce an extension of the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory and derive the field equations by varying the action with respect to the metric. This extension elucidates the dynamics of the system and demonstrates how it can encompass and recover previous cosmological models through different parameter values. We present the cosmological background equations to analyze self-accelerating solutions that can explain the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, driven by an effective cosmological constant arising from massive gravity. Besides, we apply the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with non-minimal kinetic coupling to a Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data set to test its viability. Our findings indicate that the theory is able to account for the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe without invoking dark energy. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive perturbation analysis examining tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations independently. We derive the dispersion relation of gravitational waves in a Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology and determine the stability conditions of the system. Such an analysis results in a sharper quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with non-minimal kinetic coupling by ensuring the stability conditions of the system are maintained and that strong constraints on theory parameters are provided.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17915
Elementary considerations on possible entropy-driven cosmological evolutions,"Jamy-Jayme Thézier,Aurélien Barrau,Killian Martineau",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"For several independent reasons, the idea that notorious sources of entropy could exist in the Universe has been recently revived. Taking advantage of a new framework accounting for non-equilibrium processes in cosmology, we explicitly investigate the cosmological dynamics as a function of the entropy production, focusing on the stability of the system. An exhaustive investigation is performed. As the main physical conclusion, we show that for a wide class of entropy source terms, the fluid dynamics converges towards an effective cosmological constant. Constraints on the associated entropic force are also obtained.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15146
Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators,"Konstantinos Dialektopoulos,Theodoros Papanikolaou,Vasilios Zarikas",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, Bardeen and Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m<5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 < \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}< 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18352
Consistency relations between multimessenger and large scale structure observations,Antonio Enea Romano,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a unified model independent theoretical framework to study the effects of dark energy and modified gravity. We show that applying the EFT to Horndeski theories it is possible to derive consistency relations (CR) between physically observable quantities, valid for different classes of theories defined by the brading parameter behavior, while leaving the other property functions free. As expected, the CRs are also valid for general relativity, and relate the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity distances and the speed of gravitational waves (GW). We apply the CRs to map the large scale structure observational constraints on the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter to GW-EMW distance ratio constraints. The CRs allow to probe the value of the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter with multimessenger observations, independently from large scale structure observations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04574
Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT results,"Andrea Addazi,Yermek Aldabergenov,Sergei V. Ketov",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_s$, its running index $\alpha_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10305
